That\r\n      book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There\r\n      was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is\r\n      nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without\r\n      it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly—Tom’s\r\n      Aunt Polly, she is—and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about\r\n      in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said\r\n      before.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the\r\n      money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got\r\n      six thousand dollars apiece—all gold. It was an awful sight of\r\n      money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put\r\n      it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\r\n      round—more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow\r\n      Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it\r\n      was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\r\n      and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn’t\r\n      stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my\r\n      sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he\r\n      hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might\r\n      join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went\r\n      back.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\r\n      called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it.\r\n      She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn’t do nothing but\r\n      sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing\r\n      commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to\r\n      come to time. When you got to the table you couldn’t go right to\r\n      eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and\r\n      grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn’t really\r\n      anything the matter with them,—that is, nothing only everything was\r\n      cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different;\r\n      things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go\r\n      better.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\r\n      Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by\r\n      she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then\r\n      I didn’t care no more about him, because I don’t take no stock\r\n      in dead people.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c01-18\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c01-18.jpg (67K)\" src=\"images/c01-18.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4250131480556103498\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But\r\n      she wouldn’t. She said it was a mean practice and wasn’t\r\n      clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way\r\n      with some people. They get down on a thing when they don’t\r\n      know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which\r\n      was no kin to her, and no use to anybody, being gone, you see, yet finding\r\n      a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it.\r\n      And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she\r\n      done it herself.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had\r\n      just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book.\r\n      She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her\r\n      ease up. I couldn’t stood it much longer. Then for an\r\n      hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say,\r\n      “Don’t put your feet up there, Huckleberry;” and “Don’t\r\n      scrunch up like that, Huckleberry—set up straight;” and pretty\r\n      soon she would say, “Don’t gap and stretch like that,\r\n      Huckleberry—why don’t you try to behave?” Then she\r\n      told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got\r\n      mad then, but I didn’t mean no harm. All I wanted was to go\r\n      somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn’t particular. She\r\n      said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn’t say it for\r\n      the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\r\n      Well, I couldn’t see no advantage in going where she was\r\n      going, so I made up my mind I wouldn’t try for it. But I never\r\n      said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn’t do no\r\n      good.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c01-19\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c01-19.jpg (46K)\" src=\"images/c01-19.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2136859953187885563\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\r\n      place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around\r\n      all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn’t\r\n      think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned\r\n      Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.\r\n      I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\r\n      By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\r\n      everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of\r\n      candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the\r\n      window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn’t no\r\n      use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars\r\n      were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I\r\n      heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a\r\n      whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the\r\n      wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn’t make out\r\n      what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in\r\n      the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to\r\n      tell about something that’s on its mind and can’t make itself\r\n      understood, and so can’t rest easy in its grave, and has to go about\r\n      that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I\r\n      did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up\r\n      my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I\r\n      could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn’t need anybody to\r\n      tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck,\r\n      so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned\r\n      around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then\r\n      I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.\r\n      But I hadn’t no confidence. You do that when you’ve\r\n      lost a horseshoe that you’ve found, instead of nailing it up over\r\n      the door, but I hadn’t ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep\r\n      off bad luck when you’d killed a spider.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for\r\n      the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn’t\r\n      know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go\r\n      boom—boom—boom—twelve licks; and all still again—stiller\r\n      than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\r\n      trees—something was a stirring. I set still and listened.\r\n      Directly I could just barely hear a “me-yow! me-yow!”\r\n      down there. That was good! Says I, “me-yow! me-yow!”\r\n      as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the\r\n      window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled\r\n      in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c01-21\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c01-21.jpg (46K)\" src=\"images/c01-21.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5222024497779901873\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c02-22\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c2\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c02-22.jpg (176K)\" src=\"images/c02-22.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3094607291548732209\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> CHAPTER II.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\r\n      the widow’s garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn’t\r\n      scrape our heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root\r\n      and made a noise. We scrouched down and laid still. Miss\r\n      Watson’s big nigger, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we\r\n      could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him. He\r\n      got up and stretched his neck out about a minute, listening. Then he\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who dah?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between\r\n      us; we could a touched him, nearly. Well, likely it was minutes and\r\n      minutes that there warn’t a sound, and we all there so close\r\n      together. There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\r\n      dasn’t scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\r\n      right between my shoulders. Seemed like I’d die if I couldn’t\r\n      scratch. Well, I’ve noticed that thing plenty times since.\r\n      If you are with the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to\r\n      sleep when you ain’t sleepy—if you are anywheres where it won’t\r\n      do for you to scratch, why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand\r\n      places. Pretty soon Jim says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say, who is you? Whar is you? Dog my cats ef I didn’ \r\n      hear sumf’n. Well, I know what I’s gwyne to do: I’s\r\n      gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c02-24\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c02-24.jpg (38K)\" src=\"images/c02-24.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-506356413026460427\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom. He leaned his back\r\n      up against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most\r\n      touched one of mine. My nose begun to itch. It itched till the\r\n      tears come into my eyes. But I dasn’t scratch. Then it\r\n      begun to itch on the inside. Next I got to itching underneath. I\r\n      didn’t know how I was going to set still. This miserableness went on\r\n      as much as six or seven minutes; but it seemed a sight longer than that.\r\n      I was itching in eleven different places now. I reckoned I\r\n      couldn’t stand it more’n a minute longer, but I set my teeth\r\n      hard and got ready to try. Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy;\r\n      next he begun to snore—and then I was pretty soon comfortable again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom he made a sign to me—kind of a little noise with his mouth—and\r\n      we went creeping away on our hands and knees. When we was ten foot\r\n      off Tom whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun. But\r\n      I said no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they’d\r\n      find out I warn’t in. Then Tom said he hadn’t got candles\r\n      enough, and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more. I didn’t\r\n      want him to try. I said Jim might wake up and come. But Tom\r\n      wanted to resk it; so we slid in there and got three candles, and Tom laid\r\n      five cents on the table for pay. Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to\r\n      get away; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on\r\n      his hands and knees, and play something on him. I waited, and it\r\n      seemed a good while, everything was so still and lonesome.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\r\n      and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\r\n      the house. Tom said he slipped Jim’s hat off of his head and\r\n      hung it on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn’t\r\n      wake. Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a\r\n      trance, and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees\r\n      again, and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. And next time\r\n      Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that,\r\n      every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said\r\n      they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his\r\n      back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it,\r\n      and he got so he wouldn’t hardly notice the other niggers. Niggers\r\n      would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to\r\n      than any nigger in that country. Strange niggers would stand with\r\n      their mouths open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.\r\n      Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen\r\n      fire; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such\r\n      things, Jim would happen in and say, “Hm! What you know\r\n      ’bout witches?” and that nigger was corked up and had to take\r\n      a back seat. Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck\r\n      with a string, and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own\r\n      hands, and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches\r\n      whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it; but he never told\r\n      what it was he said to it. Niggers would come from all around there\r\n      and give Jim anything they had, just for a sight of that five-center\r\n      piece; but they wouldn’t touch it, because the devil had had his\r\n      hands on it. Jim was most ruined for a servant, because he got stuck\r\n      up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\r\n      into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where there\r\n      was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine;\r\n      and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and awful still\r\n      and grand. We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers,\r\n      and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard. So we\r\n      unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half, to the\r\n      big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\r\n      secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\r\n      part of the bushes. Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\r\n      hands and knees. We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\r\n      opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\r\n      under a wall where you wouldn’t a noticed that there was a hole.\r\n      We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp\r\n      and sweaty and cold, and there we stopped. Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now, we’ll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer’s\r\n      Gang. Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his\r\n      name in blood.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c02-25\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c02-25.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c02-25.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8778319503626424324\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Everybody was willing. So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\r\n      wrote the oath on, and read it. It swore every boy to stick to the\r\n      band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\r\n      any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his\r\n      family must do it, and he mustn’t eat and he mustn’t sleep\r\n      till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the\r\n      sign of the band. And nobody that didn’t belong to the band could\r\n      use that mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he\r\n      must be killed. And if anybody that belonged to the band told the\r\n      secrets, he must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up\r\n      and the ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list\r\n      with blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on\r\n      it and be forgot forever.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got it\r\n      out of his own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\r\n      pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Some thought it would be good to kill the <i>families</i> of boys that\r\n      told the secrets. Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil\r\n      and wrote it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here’s Huck Finn, he hain’t got no family; what you\r\n      going to do ’bout him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, hain’t he got a father?” says Tom Sawyer.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, he’s got a father, but you can’t never find him\r\n      these days. He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but\r\n      he hain’t been seen in these parts for a year or more.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they said\r\n      every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it wouldn’t\r\n      be fair and square for the others. Well, nobody could think of\r\n      anything to do—everybody was stumped, and set still. I was\r\n      most ready to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered\r\n      them Miss Watson—they could kill her. Everybody said:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, she’ll do. That’s all right. Huck can\r\n      come in.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with, and\r\n      I made my mark on the paper.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now,” says Ben Rogers, “what’s the line of\r\n      business of this Gang?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Nothing only robbery and murder,” Tom said.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But who are we going to rob?—houses, or cattle, or—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain’t robbery; it’s\r\n      burglary,” says Tom Sawyer. “We ain’t burglars. That\r\n      ain’t no sort of style. We are highwaymen. We stop\r\n      stages and carriages on the road, with masks on, and kill the people and\r\n      take their watches and money.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Must we always kill the people?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, certainly. It’s best. Some authorities think\r\n      different, but mostly it’s considered best to kill them—except\r\n      some that you bring to the cave here, and keep them till they’re\r\n      ransomed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ransomed? What’s that?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know. But that’s what they do. I’ve\r\n      seen it in books; and so of course that’s what we’ve got to\r\n      do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But how can we do it if we don’t know what it is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, blame it all, we’ve <i>got</i> to do it. Don’t\r\n      I tell you it’s in the books? Do you want to go to doing\r\n      different from what’s in the books, and get things all muddled up?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, that’s all very fine to <i>say</i>, Tom Sawyer, but how\r\n      in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don’t\r\n      know how to do it to them?—that’s the thing I want to get at.\r\n      Now, what do you reckon it is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I don’t know. But per’aps if we keep them\r\n      till they’re ransomed, it means that we keep them till they’re\r\n      dead.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now, that’s something <i>like</i>. That’ll\r\n      answer. Why couldn’t you said that before? We’ll\r\n      keep them till they’re ransomed to death; and a bothersome lot they’ll\r\n      be, too—eating up everything, and always trying to get loose.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How you talk, Ben Rogers. How can they get loose when there’s\r\n      a guard over them, ready to shoot them down if they move a peg?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A guard! Well, that <i>is</i> good. So somebody’s\r\n      got to set up all night and never get any sleep, just so as to watch them.\r\n      I think that’s foolishness. Why can’t a body take a club\r\n      and ransom them as soon as they get here?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Because it ain’t in the books so—that’s why.\r\n      Now, Ben Rogers, do you want to do things regular, or don’t\r\n      you?—that’s the idea. Don’t you reckon that the\r\n      people that made the books knows what’s the correct thing to do?\r\n      Do you reckon <i>you</i> can learn ’em anything? Not by\r\n      a good deal. No, sir, we’ll just go on and ransom them in the\r\n      regular way.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right. I don’t mind; but I say it’s a fool\r\n      way, anyhow. Say, do we kill the women, too?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, Ben Rogers, if I was as ignorant as you I wouldn’t let\r\n      on. Kill the women? No; nobody ever saw anything in the books\r\n      like that. You fetch them to the cave, and you’re always as\r\n      polite as pie to them; and by and by they fall in love with you, and never\r\n      want to go home any more.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, if that’s the way I’m agreed, but I don’t\r\n      take no stock in it. Mighty soon we’ll have the cave so cluttered up\r\n      with women, and fellows waiting to be ransomed, that there won’t be\r\n      no place for the robbers. But go ahead, I ain’t got nothing to say.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now, and when they waked him up he was\r\n      scared, and cried, and said he wanted to go home to his ma, and didn’t\r\n      want to be a robber any more.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they all made fun of him, and called him cry-baby, and that made him\r\n      mad, and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets. But\r\n      Tom give him five cents to keep quiet, and said we would all go home and\r\n      meet next week, and rob somebody and kill some people.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Ben Rogers said he couldn’t get out much, only Sundays, and so he\r\n      wanted to begin next Sunday; but all the boys said it would be wicked to\r\n      do it on Sunday, and that settled the thing. They agreed to get\r\n      together and fix a day as soon as they could, and then we elected Tom\r\n      Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang, and so\r\n      started home.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking.\r\n      My new clothes was all greased up and clayey, and I was dog-tired.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c02-28\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c02-28.jpg (27K)\" src=\"images/c02-28.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2189021494472248622\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c03-29\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c3\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c03-29.jpg (160K)\" src=\"images/c03-29.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1355835327016439322\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER III.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on\r\n      account of my clothes; but the widow she didn’t scold, but only\r\n      cleaned off the grease and clay, and looked so sorry that I thought I\r\n      would behave awhile if I could. Then Miss Watson she took me in the\r\n      closet and prayed, but nothing come of it. She told me to pray every\r\n      day, and whatever I asked for I would get it. But it warn’t\r\n      so. I tried it. Once I got a fish-line, but no hooks. It warn’t\r\n      any good to me without hooks. I tried for the hooks three or four\r\n      times, but somehow I couldn’t make it work. By and by, one\r\n      day, I asked Miss Watson to try for me, but she said I was a fool. She\r\n      never told me why, and I couldn’t make it out no way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I set down one time back in the woods, and had a long think about it.\r\n      I says to myself, if a body can get anything they pray for, why don’t\r\n      Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork? Why can’t the\r\n      widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole? Why can’t\r\n      Miss Watson fat up? No, says I to my self, there ain’t nothing in\r\n      it. I went and told the widow about it, and she said the thing a\r\n      body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This\r\n      was too many for me, but she told me what she meant—I must help\r\n      other people, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for\r\n      them all the time, and never think about myself. This was including Miss\r\n      Watson, as I took it. I went out in the woods and turned it over in\r\n      my mind a long time, but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except\r\n      for the other people; so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about\r\n      it any more, but just let it go. Sometimes the widow would take me\r\n      one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body’s mouth\r\n      water; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all\r\n      down again. I judged I could see that there was two Providences, and\r\n      a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow’s\r\n      Providence, but if Miss Watson’s got him there warn’t no help\r\n      for him any more. I thought it all out, and reckoned I would belong\r\n      to the widow’s if he wanted me, though I couldn’t make out how\r\n      he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before, seeing I\r\n      was so ignorant, and so kind of low-down and ornery.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Pap he hadn’t been seen for more than a year, and that was\r\n      comfortable for me; I didn’t want to see him no more. He used\r\n      to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me; though\r\n      I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around. Well,\r\n      about this time he was found in the river drownded, about twelve mile\r\n      above town, so people said. They judged it was him, anyway; said\r\n      this drownded man was just his size, and was ragged, and had uncommon long\r\n      hair, which was all like pap; but they couldn’t make nothing out of\r\n      the face, because it had been in the water so long it warn’t much\r\n      like a face at all. They said he was floating on his back in the\r\n      water. They took him and buried him on the bank. But I warn’t\r\n      comfortable long, because I happened to think of something. I knowed\r\n      mighty well that a drownded man don’t float on his back, but on his\r\n      face. So I knowed, then, that this warn’t pap, but a woman\r\n      dressed up in a man’s clothes. So I was uncomfortable again.\r\n      I judged the old man would turn up again by and by, though I wished\r\n      he wouldn’t.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We played robber now and then about a month, and then I resigned. All\r\n      the boys did. We hadn’t robbed nobody, hadn’t killed any\r\n      people, but only just pretended. We used to hop out of the woods and\r\n      go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to\r\n      market, but we never hived any of them. Tom Sawyer called the hogs\r\n      “ingots,” and he called the turnips and stuff “julery,”\r\n      and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done, and how many\r\n      people we had killed and marked. But I couldn’t see no profit\r\n      in it. One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing\r\n      stick, which he called a slogan (which was the sign for the Gang to get\r\n      together), and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next\r\n      day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp\r\n      in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants, and six hundred camels, and\r\n      over a thousand “sumter” mules, all loaded down with di’monds,\r\n      and they didn’t have only a guard of four hundred soldiers, and so\r\n      we would lay in ambuscade, as he called it, and kill the lot and scoop the\r\n      things. He said we must slick up our swords and guns, and get ready.\r\n      He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the\r\n      swords and guns all scoured up for it, though they was only lath and\r\n      broomsticks, and you might scour at them till you rotted, and then they\r\n      warn’t worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before.\r\n      I didn’t believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and\r\n      A-rabs, but I wanted to see the camels and elephants, so I was on hand\r\n      next day, Saturday, in the ambuscade; and when we got the word we rushed\r\n      out of the woods and down the hill. But there warn’t no\r\n      Spaniards and A-rabs, and there warn’t no camels nor no elephants.\r\n      It warn’t anything but a Sunday-school picnic, and only a\r\n      primer-class at that. We busted it up, and chased the children up\r\n      the hollow; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam, though\r\n      Ben Rogers got a rag doll, and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract; and\r\n      then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c03-31\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c03-31.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c03-31.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2627606183750282123\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t see no di’monds, and I told Tom Sawyer so.\r\n      He said there was loads of them there, anyway; and he said there was\r\n      A-rabs there, too, and elephants and things. I said, why couldn’t\r\n      we see them, then? He said if I warn’t so ignorant, but had\r\n      read a book called Don Quixote, I would know without asking. He said\r\n      it was all done by enchantment. He said there was hundreds of\r\n      soldiers there, and elephants and treasure, and so on, but we had enemies\r\n      which he called magicians; and they had turned the whole thing into an\r\n      infant Sunday-school, just out of spite. I said, all right; then the\r\n      thing for us to do was to go for the magicians. Tom Sawyer said I\r\n      was a numskull.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why,” said he, “a magician could call up a lot of\r\n      genies, and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack\r\n      Robinson. They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” I says, “s’pose we got some genies to help\r\n      <i>us</i>—can’t we lick the other crowd then?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How you going to get them?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know. How do <i>they</i> get them?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring, and then the genies\r\n      come tearing in, with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the\r\n      smoke a-rolling, and everything they’re told to do they up and do\r\n      it. They don’t think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the\r\n      roots, and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it—or\r\n      any other man.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who makes them tear around so?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, whoever rubs the lamp or the ring. They belong to\r\n      whoever rubs the lamp or the ring, and they’ve got to do whatever he\r\n      says. If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di’monds,\r\n      and fill it full of chewing-gum, or whatever you want, and fetch an\r\n      emperor’s daughter from China for you to marry, they’ve got to\r\n      do it—and they’ve got to do it before sun-up next morning,\r\n      too. And more: they’ve got to waltz that palace around\r\n      over the country wherever you want it, you understand.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” says I, “I think they are a pack of flat-heads\r\n      for not keeping the palace themselves ’stead of fooling them away\r\n      like that. And what’s more—if I was one of them I would\r\n      see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for\r\n      the rubbing of an old tin lamp.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How you talk, Huck Finn. Why, you’d <i>have</i> to come\r\n      when he rubbed it, whether you wanted to or not.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What! and I as high as a tree and as big as a church? All\r\n      right, then; I <i>would</i> come; but I lay I’d make that man climb\r\n      the highest tree there was in the country.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks, it ain’t no use to talk to you, Huck Finn. You\r\n      don’t seem to know anything, somehow—perfect saphead.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I thought all this over for two or three days, and then I reckoned I would\r\n      see if there was anything in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron\r\n      ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an\r\n      Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn’t no\r\n      use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff\r\n      was only just one of Tom Sawyer’s lies. I reckoned he believed\r\n      in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It\r\n      had all the marks of a Sunday-school.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c03-33\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c03-33.jpg (67K)\" src=\"images/c03-33.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5737561375402694004\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c04-34\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c4\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c04-34.jpg (159K)\" src=\"images/c04-34.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6495162330082837080\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER IV.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now.\r\n      I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write\r\n      just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times\r\n      seven is thirty-five, and I don’t reckon I could ever get any\r\n      further than that if I was to live forever. I don’t take no\r\n      stock in mathematics, anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it.\r\n      Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next\r\n      day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school\r\n      the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow’s\r\n      ways, too, and they warn’t so raspy on me. Living in a house\r\n      and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the\r\n      cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so\r\n      that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting\r\n      so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming\r\n      along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn’t\r\n      ashamed of me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I\r\n      reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder\r\n      and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed\r\n      me off. She says, “Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess\r\n      you are always making!” The widow put in a good word for me,\r\n      but that warn’t going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well\r\n      enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky,\r\n      and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to\r\n      be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn’t\r\n      one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along\r\n      low-spirited and on the watch-out.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go\r\n      through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the\r\n      ground, and I seen somebody’s tracks. They had come up from\r\n      the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the\r\n      garden fence. It was funny they hadn’t come in, after standing\r\n      around so. I couldn’t make it out. It was very curious,\r\n      somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at\r\n      the tracks first. I didn’t notice anything at first, but next\r\n      I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails,\r\n      to keep off the devil.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was up in a second and shinning down the hill. I looked over my\r\n      shoulder every now and then, but I didn’t see nobody. I was at\r\n      Judge Thatcher’s as quick as I could get there. He said:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, my boy, you are all out of breath. Did you come for your\r\n      interest?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sir,” I says; “is there some for me?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes, a half-yearly is in last night—over a hundred and\r\n      fifty dollars. Quite a fortune for you. You had better let me\r\n      invest it along with your six thousand, because if you take it you’ll\r\n      spend it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sir,” I says, “I don’t want to spend it.\r\n      I don’t want it at all—nor the six thousand, nuther.\r\n      I want you to take it; I want to give it to you—the six\r\n      thousand and all.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c04-36\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c04-36.jpg (50K)\" src=\"images/c04-36.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1752691654923955780\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked surprised. He couldn’t seem to make it out. He\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, what can you mean, my boy?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says, “Don’t you ask me no questions about it, please.\r\n      You’ll take it—won’t you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’m puzzled. Is something the matter?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Please take it,” says I, “and don’t ask me\r\n      nothing—then I won’t have to tell no lies.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He studied a while, and then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oho-o! I think I see. You want to <i>sell</i> all your\r\n      property to me—not give it. That’s the correct idea.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “There; you see it says ‘for a consideration.’ That\r\n      means I have bought it of you and paid you for it. Here’s a\r\n      dollar for you. Now you sign it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I signed it, and left.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Miss Watson’s nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist,\r\n      which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do\r\n      magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it\r\n      knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was\r\n      here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to\r\n      know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got\r\n      out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and\r\n      dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about\r\n      an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted\r\n      just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it\r\n      and listened. But it warn’t no use; he said it wouldn’t\r\n      talk. He said sometimes it wouldn’t talk without money. I told\r\n      him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn’t no good\r\n      because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn’t\r\n      pass nohow, even if the brass didn’t show, because it was so slick\r\n      it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned\r\n      I wouldn’t say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I\r\n      said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it,\r\n      because maybe it wouldn’t know the difference. Jim smelt it\r\n      and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would\r\n      think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\r\n      and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\r\n      morning you couldn’t see no brass, and it wouldn’t feel greasy\r\n      no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a\r\n      hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had\r\n      forgot it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c04-37\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c04-37.jpg (49K)\" src=\"images/c04-37.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4651942589930265816\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball, and got down and listened again.\r\n      This time he said the hair-ball was all right. He said it would tell\r\n      my whole fortune if I wanted it to. I says, go on. So the\r\n      hair-ball talked to Jim, and Jim told it to me. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yo’ ole father doan’ know yit what he’s a-gwyne\r\n      to do. Sometimes he spec he’ll go ’way, en den agin he\r\n      spec he’ll stay.

Then I turned around and there he was.\r\n      I used to be scared of him all the time, he tanned me so much.\r\n      I reckoned I was scared now, too; but in a minute I see I was\r\n      mistaken—that is, after the first jolt, as you may say, when my\r\n      breath sort of hitched, he being so unexpected; but right away after I see\r\n      I warn’t scared of him worth bothring about.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was most fifty, and he looked it. His hair was long and tangled\r\n      and greasy, and hung down, and you could see his eyes shining through like\r\n      he was behind vines. It was all black, no gray; so was his long,\r\n      mixed-up whiskers. There warn’t no color in his face, where\r\n      his face showed; it was white; not like another man’s white, but a\r\n      white to make a body sick, a white to make a body’s flesh crawl—a\r\n      tree-toad white, a fish-belly white. As for his clothes—just\r\n      rags, that was all. He had one ankle resting on t’other knee;\r\n      the boot on that foot was busted, and two of his toes stuck through, and\r\n      he worked them now and then. His hat was laying on the floor—an\r\n      old black slouch with the top caved in, like a lid.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with his chair\r\n      tilted back a little. I set the candle down. I noticed the\r\n      window was up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me\r\n      all over. By and by he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Starchy clothes—very. You think you’re a good\r\n      deal of a big-bug, <i>don’t</i> you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Maybe I am, maybe I ain’t,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you give me none o’ your lip,” says he.\r\n      “You’ve put on considerable many frills since I been away.\r\n      I’ll take you down a peg before I get done with you. You’re\r\n      educated, too, they say—can read and write. You think you’re\r\n      better’n your father, now, don’t you, because he can’t?\r\n      <i>I’ll</i> take it out of you. Who told you you might\r\n      meddle with such hifalut’n foolishness, hey?—who told you you\r\n      could?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The widow. She told me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The widow, hey?—and who told the widow she could put in her\r\n      shovel about a thing that ain’t none of her business?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Nobody never told her.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’ll learn her how to meddle. And looky here—you\r\n      drop that school, you hear? I’ll learn people to bring up a\r\n      boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n\r\n      what <i>he</i> is. You lemme catch you fooling around that school\r\n      again, you hear? Your mother couldn’t read, and she couldn’t\r\n      write, nuther, before she died. None of the family couldn’t\r\n      before <i>they</i> died. I can’t; and here you’re\r\n      a-swelling yourself up like this. I ain’t the man to stand it—you\r\n      hear? Say, lemme hear you read.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the\r\n      wars. When I’d read about a half a minute, he fetched the book a\r\n      whack with his hand and knocked it across the house. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s so. You can do it. I had my doubts when you\r\n      told me. Now looky here; you stop that putting on frills. I\r\n      won’t have it. I’ll lay for you, my smarty; and if I\r\n      catch you about that school I’ll tan you good. First you know you’ll\r\n      get religion, too. I never see such a son.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s this?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s something they give me for learning my lessons good.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He tore it up, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll give you something better—I’ll give you a\r\n      cowhide.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute, and then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Ain’t</i> you a sweet-scented dandy, though? A bed;\r\n      and bedclothes; and a look’n’-glass; and a piece of carpet on\r\n      the floor—and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the\r\n      tanyard. I never see such a son. I bet I’ll take some o’ \r\n      these frills out o’ you before I’m done with you. Why, there\r\n      ain’t no end to your airs—they say you’re rich. Hey?—how’s\r\n      that?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c05-41\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c05-41.jpg (49K)\" src=\"images/c05-41.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3605425465523914087\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “They lie—that’s how.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Looky here—mind how you talk to me; I’m a-standing\r\n      about all I can stand now—so don’t gimme no sass. I’ve\r\n      been in town two days, and I hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ \r\n      rich. I heard about it away down the river, too. That’s\r\n      why I come. You git me that money to-morrow—I want it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t got no money.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a lie. Judge Thatcher’s got it. You\r\n      git it. I want it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t got no money, I tell you. You ask Judge\r\n      Thatcher; he’ll tell you the same.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right. I’ll ask him; and I’ll make him\r\n      pungle, too, or I’ll know the reason why. Say, how much you\r\n      got in your pocket? I want it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t got only a dollar, and I want that to—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It don’t make no difference what you want it for—you\r\n      just shell it out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He took it and bit it to see if it was good, and then he said he was going\r\n      down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.\r\n      When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed me\r\n      for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when I\r\n      reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me\r\n      to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick me\r\n      if I didn’t drop that.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next day he was drunk, and he went to Judge Thatcher’s and\r\n      bullyragged him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t,\r\n      and then he swore he’d make the law force him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from\r\n      him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that had\r\n      just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t\r\n      interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d\r\n      druther not take a child away from its father. So Judge Thatcher and\r\n      the widow had to quit on the business.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest. He said he’d\r\n      cowhide me till I was black and blue if I didn’t raise some money\r\n      for him. I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher, and pap took\r\n      it and got drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and\r\n      carrying on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most\r\n      midnight; then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court,\r\n      and jailed him again for a week. But he said <i>he</i> was\r\n      satisfied; said he was boss of his son, and he’d make it warm for <i>him</i>.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him. So\r\n      he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nice, and had\r\n      him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family, and was just old\r\n      pie to him, so to speak. And after supper he talked to him about\r\n      temperance and such things till the old man cried, and said he’d\r\n      been a fool, and fooled away his life; but now he was a-going to turn over\r\n      a new leaf and be a man nobody wouldn’t be ashamed of, and he hoped\r\n      the judge would help him and not look down on him. The judge said he\r\n      could hug him for them words; so he cried, and his wife she cried again;\r\n      pap said he’d been a man that had always been misunderstood before,\r\n      and the judge said he believed it. The old man said that what a man\r\n      wanted that was down was sympathy, and the judge said it was so; so they\r\n      cried again. And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held\r\n      out his hand, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Look at it, gentlemen and ladies all; take a-hold of it; shake it.\r\n      There’s a hand that was the hand of a hog; but it ain’t so no\r\n      more; it’s the hand of a man that’s started in on a new life,\r\n      and’ll die before he’ll go back. You mark them words—don’t\r\n      forget I said them. It’s a clean hand now; shake it—don’t\r\n      be afeard.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c05-43\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c05-43.jpg (51K)\" src=\"images/c05-43.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6487170656084573889\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they shook it, one after the other, all around, and cried. The\r\n      judge’s wife she kissed it. Then the old man he signed a\r\n      pledge—made his mark. The judge said it was the holiest time on\r\n      record, or something like that. Then they tucked the old man into a\r\n      beautiful room, which was the spare room, and in the night some time he\r\n      got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a\r\n      stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod, and clumb back\r\n      again and had a good old time; and towards daylight he crawled out again,\r\n      drunk as a fiddler, and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two\r\n      places, and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.\r\n      And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take\r\n      soundings before they could navigate it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The judge he felt kind of sore. He said he reckoned a body could\r\n      reform the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no\r\n      other way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c05-44\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c05-44.jpg (50K)\" src=\"images/c05-44.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1002295072631070961\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c6\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c06-45\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c06-45.jpg (170K)\" src=\"images/c06-45.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7374134941760422457\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went\r\n      for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he\r\n      went for me, too, for not stopping school. He catched me a couple of\r\n      times and thrashed me, but I went to school just the same, and dodged him\r\n      or outrun him most of the time. I didn’t want to go to school\r\n      much before, but I reckoned I’d go now to spite pap. That law\r\n      trial was a slow business—appeared like they warn’t ever going\r\n      to get started on it; so every now and then I’d borrow two or three\r\n      dollars off of the judge for him, to keep from getting a cowhiding. Every\r\n      time he got money he got drunk; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain\r\n      around town; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed. He was\r\n      just suited—this kind of thing was right in his line.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He got to hanging around the widow’s too much and so she told him at\r\n      last that if he didn’t quit using around there she would make\r\n      trouble for him. Well, <i>wasn’t</i> he mad? He said he would\r\n      show who was Huck Finn’s boss. So he watched out for me one\r\n      day in the spring, and catched me, and took me up the river about three\r\n      mile in a skiff, and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody\r\n      and there warn’t no houses but an old log hut in a place where the\r\n      timber was so thick you couldn’t find it if you didn’t know\r\n      where it was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He kept me with him all the time, and I never got a chance to run off. We\r\n      lived in that old cabin, and he always locked the door and put the key\r\n      under his head nights. He had a gun which he had stole, I reckon,\r\n      and we fished and hunted, and that was what we lived on. Every\r\n      little while he locked me in and went down to the store, three miles, to\r\n      the ferry, and traded fish and game for whisky, and fetched it home and\r\n      got drunk and had a good time, and licked me. The widow she found\r\n      out where I was by and by, and she sent a man over to try to get hold of\r\n      me; but pap drove him off with the gun, and it warn’t long after\r\n      that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it—all but the\r\n      cowhide part.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was kind of lazy and jolly, laying off comfortable all day, smoking and\r\n      fishing, and no books nor study. Two months or more run along, and\r\n      my clothes got to be all rags and dirt, and I didn’t see how I’d\r\n      ever got to like it so well at the widow’s, where you had to wash,\r\n      and eat on a plate, and comb up, and go to bed and get up regular, and be\r\n      forever bothering over a book, and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all\r\n      the time. I didn’t want to go back no more. I had\r\n      stopped cussing, because the widow didn’t like it; but now I took to\r\n      it again because pap hadn’t no objections. It was pretty good\r\n      times up in the woods there, take it all around.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c06-46\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c06-46.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c06-46.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2374986986455219776\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But by and by pap got too handy with his hick’ry, and I couldn’t\r\n      stand it. I was all over welts. He got to going away so much, too,\r\n      and locking me in. Once he locked me in and was gone three days.\r\n      It was dreadful lonesome. I judged he had got drownded, and I\r\n      wasn’t ever going to get out any more. I was scared. I\r\n      made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there. I had tried\r\n      to get out of that cabin many a time, but I couldn’t find no way.\r\n      There warn’t a window to it big enough for a dog to get\r\n      through. I couldn’t get up the chimbly; it was too narrow.\r\n      The door was thick, solid oak slabs. Pap was pretty careful\r\n      not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away; I reckon I\r\n      had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times; well, I was most all\r\n      the time at it, because it was about the only way to put in the time.\r\n      But this time I found something at last; I found an old rusty\r\n      wood-saw without any handle; it was laid in between a rafter and the\r\n      clapboards of the roof. I greased it up and went to work. There was\r\n      an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin\r\n      behind the table, to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and\r\n      putting the candle out. I got under the table and raised the\r\n      blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out—big\r\n      enough to let me through. Well, it was a good long job, but I was\r\n      getting towards the end of it when I heard pap’s gun in the woods.\r\n      I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid\r\n      my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Pap warn’t in a good humor—so he was his natural self. He\r\n      said he was down town, and everything was going wrong. His lawyer\r\n      said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever\r\n      got started on the trial; but then there was ways to put it off a long\r\n      time, and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it. And he said people allowed\r\n      there’d be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the\r\n      widow for my guardian, and they guessed it would win this time. This\r\n      shook me up considerable, because I didn’t want to go back to the\r\n      widow’s any more and be so cramped up and sivilized, as they called\r\n      it. Then the old man got to cussing, and cussed everything and\r\n      everybody he could think of, and then cussed them all over again to make\r\n      sure he hadn’t skipped any, and after that he polished off with a\r\n      kind of a general cuss all round, including a considerable parcel of\r\n      people which he didn’t know the names of, and so called them what’s-his-name\r\n      when he got to them, and went right along with his cussing.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He said he would like to see the widow get me. He said he would\r\n      watch out, and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a\r\n      place six or seven mile off to stow me in, where they might hunt till they\r\n      dropped and they couldn’t find me. That made me pretty uneasy\r\n      again, but only for a minute; I reckoned I wouldn’t stay on hand\r\n      till he got that chance.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got. There\r\n      was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal, and a side of bacon, ammunition, and\r\n      a four-gallon jug of whisky, and an old book and two newspapers for\r\n      wadding, besides some tow. I toted up a load, and went back and set\r\n      down on the bow of the skiff to rest. I thought it all over, and I\r\n      reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines, and take to the\r\n      woods when I run away. I guessed I wouldn’t stay in one place,\r\n      but just tramp right across the country, mostly night times, and hunt and\r\n      fish to keep alive, and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow\r\n      couldn’t ever find me any more. I judged I would saw out and\r\n      leave that night if pap got drunk enough, and I reckoned he would. I\r\n      got so full of it I didn’t notice how long I was staying till the\r\n      old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c06-48\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c06-48.jpg (66K)\" src=\"images/c06-48.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-792039575126651952\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I got the things all up to the cabin, and then it was about dark. While\r\n      I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed\r\n      up, and went to ripping again. He had been drunk over in town, and\r\n      laid in the gutter all night, and he was a sight to look at. A body\r\n      would a thought he was Adam—he was just all mud. Whenever his\r\n      liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment, this time he\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Call this a govment! why, just look at it and see what it’s\r\n      like. Here’s the law a-standing ready to take a man’s son away\r\n      from him—a man’s own son, which he has had all the trouble and\r\n      all the anxiety and all the expense of raising. Yes, just as that\r\n      man has got that son raised at last, and ready to go to work and begin to\r\n      do suthin’ for <i>him</i> and give him a rest, the law up and goes\r\n      for him. And they call <i>that</i> govment! That ain’t\r\n      all, nuther. The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him\r\n      to keep me out o’ my property. Here’s what the law does:\r\n      The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up’ards,\r\n      and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this, and lets him go round\r\n      in clothes that ain’t fitten for a hog. They call that govment!\r\n      A man can’t get his rights in a govment like this. Sometimes I’ve\r\n      a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all. Yes, and I <i>told</i>\r\n      ’em so; I told old Thatcher so to his face. Lots of ’em\r\n      heard me, and can tell what I said. Says I, for two cents I’d\r\n      leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin. Them’s\r\n      the very words. I says look at my hat—if you call it a hat—but\r\n      the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it’s below my\r\n      chin, and then it ain’t rightly a hat at all, but more like my head\r\n      was shoved up through a jint o’ stove-pipe. Look at it, says I—such\r\n      a hat for me to wear—one of the wealthiest men in this town if I\r\n      could git my rights.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes, this is a wonderful govment, wonderful. Why, looky\r\n      here. There was a free nigger there from Ohio—a mulatter, most as\r\n      white as a white man. He had the whitest shirt on you ever see, too,\r\n      and the shiniest hat; and there ain’t a man in that town that’s\r\n      got as fine clothes as what he had; and he had a gold watch and chain, and\r\n      a silver-headed cane—the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the\r\n      State. And what do you think? They said he was a p’fessor\r\n      in a college, and could talk all kinds of languages, and knowed\r\n      everything. And that ain’t the wust. They said he could <i>vote</i>\r\n      when he was at home. Well, that let me out. Thinks I, what is the\r\n      country a-coming to? It was ’lection day, and I was just about\r\n      to go and vote myself if I warn’t too drunk to get there; but when\r\n      they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that\r\n      nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote agin. Them’s\r\n      the very words I said; they all heard me; and the country may rot for all\r\n      me—I’ll never vote agin as long as I live. And to see\r\n      the cool way of that nigger—why, he wouldn’t a give me the\r\n      road if I hadn’t shoved him out o’ the way. I says to\r\n      the people, why ain’t this nigger put up at auction and sold?—that’s\r\n      what I want to know. And what do you reckon they said? Why, they\r\n      said he couldn’t be sold till he’d been in the State six\r\n      months, and he hadn’t been there that long yet. There, now—that’s\r\n      a specimen. They call that a govment that can’t sell a free\r\n      nigger till he’s been in the State six months. Here’s a\r\n      govment that calls itself a govment, and lets on to be a govment, and\r\n      thinks it is a govment, and yet’s got to set stock-still for six\r\n      whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling, thieving, infernal,\r\n      white-shirted free nigger, and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking\r\n      him to, so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked\r\n      both shins, and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of\r\n      language—mostly hove at the nigger and the govment, though he give\r\n      the tub some, too, all along, here and there. He hopped around the\r\n      cabin considerable, first on one leg and then on the other, holding first\r\n      one shin and then the other one, and at last he let out with his left foot\r\n      all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick. But it warn’t\r\n      good judgment, because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes\r\n      leaking out of the front end of it; so now he raised a howl that fairly\r\n      made a body’s hair raise, and down he went in the dirt, and rolled\r\n      there, and held his toes; and the cussing he done then laid over anything\r\n      he had ever done previous. He said so his own self afterwards.\r\n      He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days, and he said it\r\n      laid over him, too; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on, maybe.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After supper pap took the jug, and said he had enough whisky there for two\r\n      drunks and one delirium tremens. That was always his word. I\r\n      judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour, and then I would steal\r\n      the key, or saw myself out, one or t’other. He drank and\r\n      drank, and tumbled down on his blankets by and by; but luck didn’t\r\n      run my way. He didn’t go sound asleep, but was uneasy. He\r\n      groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time.\r\n      At last I got so sleepy I couldn’t keep my eyes open all I\r\n      could do, and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep, and\r\n      the candle burning.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c06-51\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c06-51.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c06-51.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2912758421562071540\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I don’t know how long I was asleep, but all of a sudden there was an\r\n      awful scream and I was up. There was pap looking wild, and skipping\r\n      around every which way and yelling about snakes. He said they was\r\n      crawling up his legs; and then he would give a jump and scream, and say\r\n      one had bit him on the cheek—but I couldn’t see no snakes.\r\n      He started and run round and round the cabin, hollering “Take\r\n      him off! take him off! he’s biting me on the neck!” I\r\n      never see a man look so wild in the eyes. Pretty soon he was all fagged\r\n      out, and fell down panting; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast,\r\n      kicking things every which way, and striking and grabbing at the air with\r\n      his hands, and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him. He\r\n      wore out by and by, and laid still a while, moaning. Then he laid\r\n      stiller, and didn’t make a sound. I could hear the owls and\r\n      the wolves away off in the woods, and it seemed terrible still. He\r\n      was laying over by the corner. By and by he raised up part way and\r\n      listened, with his head to one side. He says, very low:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tramp—tramp—tramp; that’s the dead; tramp—tramp—tramp;\r\n      they’re coming after me; but I won’t go. Oh, they’re\r\n      here! don’t touch me—don’t! hands off—they’re\r\n      cold; let go. Oh, let a poor devil alone!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he went down on all fours and crawled off, begging them to let him\r\n      alone, and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the\r\n      old pine table, still a-begging; and then he went to crying. I could\r\n      hear him through the blanket.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild, and he see\r\n      me and went for me. He chased me round and round the place with a\r\n      clasp-knife, calling me the Angel of Death, and saying he would kill me,\r\n      and then I couldn’t come for him no more. I begged, and told\r\n      him I was only Huck; but he laughed <i>such</i> a screechy laugh, and\r\n      roared and cussed, and kept on chasing me up. Once when I turned\r\n      short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket\r\n      between my shoulders, and I thought I was gone; but I slid out of the\r\n      jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself. Pretty soon he was all tired\r\n      out, and dropped down with his back against the door, and said he would\r\n      rest a minute and then kill me. He put his knife under him, and said he\r\n      would sleep and get strong, and then he would see who was who.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he dozed off pretty soon. By and by I got the old split-bottom\r\n      chair and clumb up as easy as I could, not to make any noise, and got down\r\n      the gun. I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded,\r\n      then I laid it across the turnip barrel, pointing towards pap, and set\r\n      down behind it to wait for him to stir. And how slow and still the\r\n      time did drag along.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c07-53\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c7\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c07-53.jpg (148K)\" src=\"images/c07-53.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-658268778692675841\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Git up! What you ’bout?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It\r\n      was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over\r\n      me looking sour and sick, too. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What you doin’ with this gun?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I judged he didn’t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why didn’t you roust me out?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I tried to, but I couldn’t; I couldn’t budge you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, all right. Don’t stand there palavering all day,\r\n      but out with you and see if there’s a fish on the lines for\r\n      breakfast. I’ll be along in a minute.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed\r\n      some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of\r\n      bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would\r\n      have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used\r\n      to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes\r\n      cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts—sometimes a dozen\r\n      logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the\r\n      wood-yards and the sawmill.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t’other one\r\n      out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here\r\n      comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long,\r\n      riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a\r\n      frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just\r\n      expected there’d be somebody laying down in it, because people often\r\n      done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it\r\n      they’d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn’t so this\r\n      time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled\r\n      her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this—she’s\r\n      worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn’t in sight\r\n      yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung\r\n      over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I’d\r\n      hide her good, and then, ’stead of taking to the woods when I run\r\n      off, I’d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place\r\n      for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c07-54\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c07-54.jpg (79K)\" src=\"images/c07-54.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7525547885085644977\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\r\n      coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a\r\n      bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just\r\n      drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn’t seen\r\n      anything.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When he got along I was hard at it taking up a “trot” line.\r\n      He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in\r\n      the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see\r\n      I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five\r\n      catfish off the lines and went home.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore\r\n      out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the\r\n      widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than\r\n      trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all\r\n      kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn’t see no way for a\r\n      while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of\r\n      water, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out,\r\n      you hear? That man warn’t here for no good. I’d a shot\r\n      him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying\r\n      give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now\r\n      so nobody won’t think of following me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      About twelve o’clock we turned out and went along up the bank.\r\n      The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by\r\n      on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft—nine logs fast\r\n      together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then\r\n      we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so\r\n      as to catch more stuff; but that warn’t pap’s style. Nine\r\n      logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell.\r\n      So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the\r\n      raft about half-past three. I judged he wouldn’t come back\r\n      that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I\r\n      out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t’other\r\n      side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck\r\n      on the water away off yonder.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\r\n      shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\r\n      with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee\r\n      and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took\r\n      the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and\r\n      two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines\r\n      and matches and other things—everything that was worth a cent.\r\n      I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn’t\r\n      any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to\r\n      leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\r\n      out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the\r\n      outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness\r\n      and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place,\r\n      and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was\r\n      bent up at that place and didn’t quite touch ground. If you\r\n      stood four or five foot away and didn’t know it was sawed, you\r\n      wouldn’t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the\r\n      cabin, and it warn’t likely anybody would go fooling around there.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn’t left a track.\r\n      I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out\r\n      over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a\r\n      piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a\r\n      wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from\r\n      the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c07-56\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c07-56.jpg (62K)\" src=\"images/c07-56.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-833444164532795771\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it\r\n      considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back\r\n      nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him\r\n      down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground—hard\r\n      packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot\r\n      of big rocks in it—all I could drag—and I started it from the\r\n      pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river\r\n      and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see\r\n      that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom\r\n      Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of\r\n      business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread\r\n      himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\r\n      stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I\r\n      took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn’t\r\n      drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the\r\n      river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the\r\n      bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the\r\n      house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole\r\n      in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn’t no knives and\r\n      forks on the place—pap done everything with his clasp-knife about\r\n      the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across\r\n      the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake\r\n      that was five mile wide and full of rushes—and ducks too, you might\r\n      say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it\r\n      on the other side that went miles away, I don’t know where, but it\r\n      didn’t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little\r\n      track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap’s whetstone there\r\n      too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the\r\n      rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn’t leak no more, and\r\n      took it and my saw to the canoe again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\r\n      willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I\r\n      made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down\r\n      in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself,\r\n      they’ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and\r\n      then drag the river for me. And they’ll follow that meal track\r\n      to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find\r\n      the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won’t\r\n      ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They’ll soon\r\n      get tired of that, and won’t bother no more about me. All\r\n      right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson’s Island is good\r\n      enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes\r\n      there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around\r\n      and pick up things I want. Jackson’s Island’s the place.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When\r\n      I woke up I didn’t know where I was for a minute. I set up and\r\n      looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river\r\n      looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a\r\n      counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still,\r\n      hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked\r\n      late, and <i>smelt</i> late. You know what I mean—I don’t know\r\n      the words to put it in.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\r\n      when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty\r\n      soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that\r\n      comes from oars working in rowlocks when it’s a still night. I\r\n      peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was—a skiff,\r\n      away across the water. I couldn’t tell how many was in it.\r\n      It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn’t\r\n      but one man in it. Think’s I, maybe it’s pap, though I\r\n      warn’t expecting him. He dropped below me with the current,\r\n      and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went\r\n      by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it\r\n      <i>was</i> pap, sure enough—and sober, too, by the way he laid his\r\n      oars.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t lose no time. The next minute I was a-spinning down\r\n      stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and\r\n      a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle\r\n      of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing,\r\n      and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the\r\n      driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her\r\n      float.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c07-59\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c07-59.jpg (77K)\" src=\"images/c07-59.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1556181878506343223\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe,\r\n      looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so\r\n      deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it\r\n      before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I\r\n      heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too—every\r\n      word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and\r\n      the short nights now. T’other one said <i>this</i> warn’t\r\n      one of the short ones, he reckoned—and then they laughed, and he\r\n      said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another\r\n      fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn’t laugh; he ripped out\r\n      something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he\r\n      ’lowed to tell it to his old woman—she would think it was\r\n      pretty good; but he said that warn’t nothing to some things he had\r\n      said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o’clock,\r\n      and he hoped daylight wouldn’t wait more than about a week longer.\r\n      After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn’t\r\n      make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then\r\n      a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson’s\r\n      Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing\r\n      up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a\r\n      steamboat without any lights. There warn’t any signs of the\r\n      bar at the head—it was all under water now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It didn’t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a\r\n      ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water\r\n      and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe\r\n      into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\r\n      branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\r\n      from the outside.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out\r\n      on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three\r\n      mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A\r\n      monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\r\n      with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down,\r\n      and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, “Stern\r\n      oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!” I heard that just\r\n      as plain as if the man was by my side.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\r\n      laid down for a nap before breakfast.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c08-61\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c8\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c08-61.jpg (179K)\" src=\"images/c08-61.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5451967121678834874\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER VIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o’clock.\r\n      I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things,\r\n      and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied. I could see\r\n      the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees all about,\r\n      and gloomy in there amongst them. There was freckled places on the\r\n      ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the freckled\r\n      places swapped about a little, showing there was a little breeze up there.\r\n      A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very\r\n      friendly.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was powerful lazy and comfortable—didn’t want to get up and\r\n      cook breakfast. Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a\r\n      deep sound of “boom!” away up the river. I rouses up,\r\n      and rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I\r\n      hopped up, and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a\r\n      bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up—about abreast the\r\n      ferry. And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along\r\n      down. I knowed what was the matter now. “Boom!” I see\r\n      the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat’s side. You see,\r\n      they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to\r\n      the top.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was pretty hungry, but it warn’t going to do for me to start a\r\n      fire, because they might see the smoke. So I set there and watched\r\n      the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was a mile wide\r\n      there, and it always looks pretty on a summer morning—so I was\r\n      having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had\r\n      a bite to eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put\r\n      quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go\r\n      right to the drownded carcass and stop there. So, says I, I’ll\r\n      keep a lookout, and if any of them’s floating around after me I’ll\r\n      give them a show. I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to\r\n      see what luck I could have, and I warn’t disappointed. A big\r\n      double loaf come along, and I most got it with a long stick, but my foot\r\n      slipped and she floated out further. Of course I was where the\r\n      current set in the closest to the shore—I knowed enough for that.\r\n      But by and by along comes another one, and this time I won. I\r\n      took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver, and set my\r\n      teeth in. It was “baker’s bread”—what the\r\n      quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\r\n      the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied. And\r\n      then something struck me. I says, now I reckon the widow or the\r\n      parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has\r\n      gone and done it. So there ain’t no doubt but there is\r\n      something in that thing—that is, there’s something in it when\r\n      a body like the widow or the parson prays, but it don’t work for me,\r\n      and I reckon it don’t work for only just the right kind.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c08-63\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c08-63.jpg (79K)\" src=\"images/c08-63.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1564458477050605536\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching. The\r\n      ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I’d have a\r\n      chance to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come\r\n      in close, where the bread did. When she’d got pretty well\r\n      along down towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out\r\n      the bread, and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.\r\n      Where the log forked I could peep through.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could a\r\n      run out a plank and walked ashore. Most everybody was on the boat.\r\n      Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\r\n      Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more. Everybody\r\n      was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s\r\n      washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.\r\n      I hope so, anyway.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t hope so. They all crowded up and leaned over the\r\n      rails, nearly in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.\r\n      I could see them first-rate, but they couldn’t see me. Then\r\n      the captain sung out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Stand away!” and the cannon let off such a blast right before\r\n      me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the\r\n      smoke, and I judged I was gone. If they’d a had some bullets\r\n      in, I reckon they’d a got the corpse they was after. Well, I\r\n      see I warn’t hurt, thanks to goodness. The boat floated on and went\r\n      out of sight around the shoulder of the island. I could hear the\r\n      booming now and then, further and further off, and by and by, after an\r\n      hour, I didn’t hear it no more. The island was three mile\r\n      long. I judged they had got to the foot, and was giving it up.\r\n      But they didn’t yet a while. They turned around the foot\r\n      of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side, under\r\n      steam, and booming once in a while as they went. I crossed over to\r\n      that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the island\r\n      they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to\r\n      the town.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I knowed I was all right now. Nobody else would come a-hunting after\r\n      me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\r\n      woods. I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\r\n      under so the rain couldn’t get at them. I catched a catfish\r\n      and haggled him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp\r\n      fire and had supper. Then I set out a line to catch some fish for\r\n      breakfast.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\r\n      satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set on\r\n      the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the stars\r\n      and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed; there ain’t\r\n      no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you can’t stay\r\n      so, you soon get over it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so for three days and nights. No difference—just the same\r\n      thing. But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.\r\n      I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to\r\n      know all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time. I found\r\n      plenty strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\r\n      razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show. They\r\n      would all come handy by and by, I judged.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn’t\r\n      far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I hadn’t\r\n      shot nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\r\n      home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake, and it\r\n      went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after it, trying to\r\n      get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on\r\n      to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c08-64\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c08-64.jpg (65K)\" src=\"images/c08-64.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1540987318392468379\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      My heart jumped up amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look\r\n      further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast\r\n      as ever I could. Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\r\n      thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn’t\r\n      hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then\r\n      listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it\r\n      for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a\r\n      person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short\r\n      half, too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got to camp I warn’t feeling very brash, there warn’t\r\n      much sand in my craw; but I says, this ain’t no time to be fooling\r\n      around. So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them\r\n      out of sight, and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to\r\n      look like an old last year’s camp, and then clumb a tree.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn’t see nothing, I\r\n      didn’t hear nothing—I only <i>thought</i> I heard and seen as\r\n      much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn’t stay up there\r\n      forever; so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the\r\n      lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left\r\n      over from breakfast.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By the time it was night I was pretty hungry. So when it was good\r\n      and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\r\n      Illinois bank—about a quarter of a mile. I went out in the\r\n      woods and cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay\r\n      there all night when I hear a <i>plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk</i>, and\r\n      says to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people’s voices.\r\n      I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went\r\n      creeping through the woods to see what I could find out. I hadn’t\r\n      got far when I hear a man say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is\r\n      about beat out. Let’s look around.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy. I tied up\r\n      in the old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t sleep much. I couldn’t, somehow, for thinking.\r\n      And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.\r\n      So the sleep didn’t do me no good. By and by I says to\r\n      myself, I can’t live this way; I’m a-going to find out who it\r\n      is that’s here on the island with me; I’ll find it out or\r\n      bust. Well, I felt better right off.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and then\r\n      let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows. The moon was\r\n      shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\r\n      I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and\r\n      sound asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the\r\n      island. A little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as\r\n      good as saying the night was about done. I give her a turn with the\r\n      paddle and brung her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and\r\n      into the edge of the woods. I sat down there on a log, and looked\r\n      out through the leaves. I see the moon go off watch, and the\r\n      darkness begin to blanket the river. But in a little while I see a pale\r\n      streak over the treetops, and knowed the day was coming. So I took\r\n      my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire,\r\n      stopping every minute or two to listen. But I hadn’t no luck\r\n      somehow; I couldn’t seem to find the place. But by and by,\r\n      sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees. I\r\n      went for it, cautious and slow. By and by I was close enough to have\r\n      a look, and there laid a man on the ground. It most give me the\r\n      fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his head was nearly in the\r\n      fire. I set there behind a clump of bushes, in about six foot of\r\n      him, and kept my eyes on him steady. It was getting gray daylight\r\n      now. Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the\r\n      blanket, and it was Miss Watson’s Jim! I bet I was glad to see\r\n      him. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello, Jim!” and skipped out.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He bounced up and stared at me wild. Then he drops down on his\r\n      knees, and puts his hands together and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Doan’ hurt me—don’t! I hain’t ever\r\n      done no harm to a ghos’. I alwuz liked dead people, en done\r\n      all I could for ’em. You go en git in de river agin, whah you\r\n      b’longs, en doan’ do nuffn to Ole Jim, ’at ’uz\r\n      awluz yo’ fren’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c08-67\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c08-67.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c08-67.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1405915288337014998\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I warn’t long making him understand I warn’t dead.\r\n      I was ever so glad to see Jim. I warn’t lonesome now.\r\n      I told him I warn’t afraid of <i>him</i> telling the people\r\n      where I was. I talked along, but he only set there and looked at me;\r\n      never said nothing. Then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s good daylight. Le’s get breakfast. Make\r\n      up your camp fire good.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s de use er makin’ up de camp fire to cook\r\n      strawbries en sich truck? But you got a gun, hain’t you? Den\r\n      we kin git sumfn better den strawbries.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Strawberries and such truck,” I says. “Is that what you\r\n      live on?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I couldn’ git nuffn else,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I come heah de night arter you’s killed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What, all that time?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes—indeedy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “And ain’t you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah—nuffn else.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you must be most starved, ain’t you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reck’n I could eat a hoss. I think I could. How long\r\n      you ben on de islan’?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Since the night I got killed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No! W’y, what has you lived on? But you got a\r\n      gun. Oh, yes, you got a gun. Dat’s good. Now you\r\n      kill sumfn en I’ll make up de fire.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in a\r\n      grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and coffee,\r\n      and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the nigger was\r\n      set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done with\r\n      witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him with\r\n      his knife, and fried him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\r\n      Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. Then\r\n      when we had got pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and\r\n      by Jim says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But looky here, Huck, who wuz it dat ’uz killed in dat shanty\r\n      ef it warn’t you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I told him the whole thing, and he said it was smart. He said\r\n      Tom Sawyer couldn’t get up no better plan than what I had. Then\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How do you come to be here, Jim, and how’d you get here?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked pretty uneasy, and didn’t say nothing for a minute. Then\r\n      he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Maybe I better not tell.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, dey’s reasons. But you wouldn’ tell on me\r\n      ef I uz to tell you, would you, Huck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blamed if I would, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I b’lieve you, Huck. I—<i>I run off</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jim!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But mind, you said you wouldn’ tell—you know you said\r\n      you wouldn’ tell, Huck.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I did. I said I wouldn’t, and I’ll stick to\r\n      it. Honest <i>injun</i>, I will. People would call me a\r\n      low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t\r\n      make no difference. I ain’t a-going to tell, and I ain’t\r\n      a-going back there, anyways. So, now, le’s know all about it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you see, it ’uz dis way. Ole missus—dat’s\r\n      Miss Watson—she pecks on me all de time, en treats me pooty rough,\r\n      but she awluz said she wouldn’ sell me down to Orleans. But I\r\n      noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun’ de place considable lately, en\r\n      I begin to git oneasy.

Well, I wuz dah all night.\r\n      Dey wuz somebody roun’ all de time. ’Long ’bout\r\n      six in de mawnin’ skifts begin to go by, en ’bout eight er\r\n      nine every skift dat went ’long wuz talkin’ ’bout how yo’ \r\n      pap come over to de town en say you’s killed. Dese las’ \r\n      skifts wuz full o’ ladies en genlmen a-goin’ over for to see\r\n      de place. Sometimes dey’d pull up at de sho’ en take a\r\n      res’ b’fo’ dey started acrost, so by de talk I got to\r\n      know all ’bout de killin’. I ’uz powerful sorry\r\n      you’s killed, Huck, but I ain’t no mo’ now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I laid dah under de shavin’s all day. I ’uz\r\n      hungry, but I warn’t afeard; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder\r\n      wuz goin’ to start to de camp-meet’n’ right arter\r\n      breakfas’ en be gone all day, en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle\r\n      ’bout daylight, so dey wouldn’ ’spec to see me roun’ \r\n      de place, en so dey wouldn’ miss me tell arter dark in de evenin’.\r\n      De yuther servants wouldn’ miss me, kase dey’d shin out en\r\n      take holiday soon as de ole folks ’uz out’n de way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, when it come dark I tuck out up de river road, en went\r\n      ’bout two mile er more to whah dey warn’t no houses. I’d\r\n      made up my mine ’bout what I’s agwyne to do. You see, ef\r\n      I kep’ on tryin’ to git away afoot, de dogs ’ud track\r\n      me; ef I stole a skift to cross over, dey’d miss dat skift, you see,\r\n      en dey’d know ’bout whah I’d lan’ on de yuther\r\n      side, en whah to pick up my track. So I says, a raff is what I’s\r\n      arter; it doan’ <i>make</i> no track.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I see a light a-comin’ roun’ de p’int bymeby, so\r\n      I wade’ in en shove’ a log ahead o’ me en swum more’n\r\n      half way acrost de river, en got in ’mongst de drift-wood, en kep’ \r\n      my head down low, en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along.\r\n      Den I swum to de stern uv it en tuck a-holt. It clouded up en\r\n      ’uz pooty dark for a little while. So I clumb up en laid down\r\n      on de planks. De men ’uz all ’way yonder in de middle,\r\n      whah de lantern wuz. De river wuz a-risin’, en dey wuz a good\r\n      current; so I reck’n’d ’at by fo’ in de mawnin’ \r\n      I’d be twenty-five mile down de river, en den I’d slip in jis\r\n      b’fo’ daylight en swim asho’, en take to de woods on de\r\n      Illinois side.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But I didn’ have no luck. When we ’uz mos’ \r\n      down to de head er de islan’ a man begin to come aft wid de lantern,\r\n      I see it warn’t no use fer to wait, so I slid overboard en struck\r\n      out fer de islan’. Well, I had a notion I could lan’ mos’ \r\n      anywhers, but I couldn’t—bank too bluff. I ’uz mos’ \r\n      to de foot er de islan’ b’fo’ I found’ a good\r\n      place. I went into de woods en jedged I wouldn’ fool wid raffs\r\n      no mo’, long as dey move de lantern roun’ so. I had my\r\n      pipe en a plug er dog-leg, en some matches in my cap, en dey warn’t\r\n      wet, so I ’uz all right.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “And so you ain’t had no meat nor bread to eat all this time?\r\n      Why didn’t you get mud-turkles?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How you gwyne to git ’m? You can’t slip up on um\r\n      en grab um; en how’s a body gwyne to hit um wid a rock? How\r\n      could a body do it in de night? En I warn’t gwyne to show\r\n      mysef on de bank in de daytime.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, that’s so. You’ve had to keep in the woods\r\n      all the time, of course. Did you hear ’em shooting the cannon?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes. I knowed dey was arter you. I see um go by\r\n      heah—watched um thoo de bushes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Some young birds come along, flying a yard or two at a time and lighting.\r\n      Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain. He said it was a sign\r\n      when young chickens flew that way, and so he reckoned it was the same way\r\n      when young birds done it. I was going to catch some of them, but Jim\r\n      wouldn’t let me. He said it was death. He said his\r\n      father laid mighty sick once, and some of them catched a bird, and his old\r\n      granny said his father would die, and he did.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And Jim said you mustn’t count the things you are going to cook for\r\n      dinner, because that would bring bad luck. The same if you shook the\r\n      table-cloth after sundown. And he said if a man owned a beehive and\r\n      that man died, the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning,\r\n      or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die. Jim\r\n      said bees wouldn’t sting idiots; but I didn’t believe that,\r\n      because I had tried them lots of times myself, and they wouldn’t\r\n      sting me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had heard about some of these things before, but not all of them. Jim\r\n      knowed all kinds of signs. He said he knowed most everything. I\r\n      said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck, and so I asked\r\n      him if there warn’t any good-luck signs. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mighty few—an’ <i>dey</i> ain’t no use to a body.\r\n      What you want to know when good luck’s a-comin’ for?\r\n      Want to keep it off?” And he said: “Ef you’s\r\n      got hairy arms en a hairy breas’, it’s a sign dat you’s\r\n      agwyne to be rich. Well, dey’s some use in a sign like dat, ’kase\r\n      it’s so fur ahead. You see, maybe you’s got to be po’ a\r\n      long time fust, en so you might git discourage’ en kill yo’sef\r\n      ’f you didn’ know by de sign dat you gwyne to be rich bymeby.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Have you got hairy arms and a hairy breast, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s de use to ax dat question? Don’t you see I\r\n      has?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, are you rich?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, but I ben rich wunst, and gwyne to be rich agin. Wunst I\r\n      had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat’n’, en got busted\r\n      out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did you speculate in, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, fust I tackled stock.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What kind of stock?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, live stock—cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in\r\n      a cow. But I ain’ gwyne to resk no mo’ money in stock.\r\n      De cow up ’n’ died on my han’s.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So you lost the ten dollars.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, I didn’t lose it all. I on’y los’ \r\n      ’bout nine of it. I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten\r\n      cents.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You had five dollars and ten cents left. Did you speculate\r\n      any more?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c08-72\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c08-72.jpg (61K)\" src=\"images/c08-72.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8007466636649641967\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.

Well, he sot up a bank, en say anybody dat put in a\r\n      dollar would git fo’ dollars mo’ at de en’ er de year.\r\n      Well, all de niggers went in, but dey didn’t have much. I\r\n      wuz de on’y one dat had much. So I stuck out for mo’ dan\r\n      fo’ dollars, en I said ’f I didn’ git it I’d start\r\n      a bank mysef. Well, o’ course dat nigger want’ to keep me out\r\n      er de business, bekase he says dey warn’t business ’nough for\r\n      two banks, so he say I could put in my five dollars en he pay me\r\n      thirty-five at de en’ er de year.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So I done it.

We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\r\n      the bushes so thick. We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\r\n      and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the side\r\n      towards Illinois. The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\r\n      bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it. It was cool\r\n      in there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\r\n      didn’t want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps in\r\n      the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island, and\r\n      they would never find us without dogs. And, besides, he said them\r\n      little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\r\n      get wet?\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern, and\r\n      lugged all the traps up there. Then we hunted up a place close by to\r\n      hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows. We took some fish off\r\n      of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\r\n      side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a good\r\n      place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c09-75\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c09-75.jpg (59K)\" src=\"images/c09-75.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7677889764376134814\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\r\n      We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty\r\n      soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\r\n      right about it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all\r\n      fury, too, and I never see the wind blow so. It was one of these\r\n      regular summer storms. It would get so dark that it looked all\r\n      blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so\r\n      thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and\r\n      here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up\r\n      the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust\r\n      would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\r\n      was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and blackest—<i>FST</i>!\r\n      it was as bright as glory, and you’d have a little glimpse of\r\n      tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm, hundreds of yards\r\n      further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a second, and now\r\n      you’d hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go\r\n      rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the\r\n      world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs—where it’s long\r\n      stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jim, this is nice,” I says. “I wouldn’t want to\r\n      be nowhere else but here. Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot\r\n      corn-bread.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you wouldn’t a ben here ’f it hadn’t a ben\r\n      for Jim. You’d a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner,\r\n      en gittn’ mos’ drownded, too; dat you would, honey. Chickens\r\n      knows when it’s gwyne to rain, en so do de birds, chile.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at last\r\n      it was over the banks. The water was three or four foot deep on the\r\n      island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom. On that side it\r\n      was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same old\r\n      distance across—a half a mile—because the Missouri shore was\r\n      just a wall of high bluffs.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\r\n      and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside. We\r\n      went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung so\r\n      thick we had to back away and go some other way. Well, on every old\r\n      broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\r\n      when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\r\n      account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your hand\r\n      on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtles—they would\r\n      slide off in the water. The ridge our cavern was in was full of\r\n      them. We could a had pets enough if we’d wanted them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft—nice pine\r\n      planks. It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long,\r\n      and the top stood above water six or seven inches—a solid, level\r\n      floor. We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we\r\n      let them go; we didn’t show ourselves in daylight.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\r\n      daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side. She was a\r\n      two-story, and tilted over considerable. We paddled out and got\r\n      aboard—clumb in at an upstairs window. But it was too dark to\r\n      see yet, so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island. Then\r\n      we looked in at the window. We could make out a bed, and a table,\r\n      and two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and\r\n      there was clothes hanging against the wall. There was something\r\n      laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man. So Jim\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello, you!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But it didn’t budge. So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “De man ain’t asleep—he’s dead. You hold\r\n      still—I’ll go en see.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a dead man. Yes, indeedy; naked, too. He’s\r\n      ben shot in de back. I reck’n he’s ben dead two er three days.\r\n      Come in, Huck, but doan’ look at his face—it’s too\r\n      gashly.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c09-77\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c09-77.jpg (73K)\" src=\"images/c09-77.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2608109878719019631\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t look at him at all. Jim throwed some old rags over\r\n      him, but he needn’t done it; I didn’t want to see him. There\r\n      was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old\r\n      whisky bottles, and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all\r\n      over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with\r\n      charcoal. There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet,\r\n      and some women’s underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men’s\r\n      clothing, too. We put the lot into the canoe—it might come\r\n      good. There was a boy’s old speckled straw hat on the floor; I\r\n      took that, too. And there was a bottle that had had milk in it, and\r\n      it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck. We would a took the bottle,\r\n      but it was broke. There was a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk\r\n      with the hinges broke. They stood open, but there warn’t\r\n      nothing left in them that was any account. The way things was\r\n      scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry, and warn’t\r\n      fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and a\r\n      bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\r\n      candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\r\n      old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax\r\n      and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet and some\r\n      nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous\r\n      hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar, and a\r\n      horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn’t have no label on\r\n      them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb, and\r\n      Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg. The straps\r\n      was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\r\n      it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn’t\r\n      find the other one, though we hunted all around.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so, take it all around, we made a good haul. When we was ready\r\n      to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was\r\n      pretty broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with\r\n      the quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\r\n      ways off. I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down\r\n      most a half a mile doing it. I crept up the dead water under the\r\n      bank, and hadn’t no accidents and didn’t see nobody. We\r\n      got home all safe.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c10-79\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c10\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c10-79.jpg (191K)\" src=\"images/c10-79.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4505710618123375718\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER X.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he\r\n      come to be killed, but Jim didn’t want to. He said it would\r\n      fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha’nt us; he\r\n      said a man that warn’t buried was more likely to go a-ha’nting\r\n      around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded\r\n      pretty reasonable, so I didn’t say no more; but I couldn’t\r\n      keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what\r\n      they done it for.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We rummaged the clothes we’d got, and found eight dollars in silver\r\n      sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat. Jim said he\r\n      reckoned the people in that house stole the coat, because if they’d\r\n      a knowed the money was there they wouldn’t a left it. I said I\r\n      reckoned they killed him, too; but Jim didn’t want to talk about\r\n      that. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now you think it’s bad luck; but what did you say when I\r\n      fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before\r\n      yesterday? You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a\r\n      snake-skin with my hands. Well, here’s your bad luck! We’ve\r\n      raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides. I wish we could\r\n      have some bad luck like this every day, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Never you mind, honey, never you mind. Don’t you git\r\n      too peart. It’s a-comin’. Mind I tell you, it’s\r\n      a-comin’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It did come, too. It was a Tuesday that we had that talk. Well,\r\n      after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of\r\n      the ridge, and got out of tobacco. I went to the cavern to get some,\r\n      and found a rattlesnake in there. I killed him, and curled him up on\r\n      the foot of Jim’s blanket, ever so natural, thinking there’d\r\n      be some fun when Jim found him there. Well, by night I forgot all\r\n      about the snake, and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I\r\n      struck a light the snake’s mate was there, and bit him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He jumped up yelling, and the first thing the light showed was the varmint\r\n      curled up and ready for another spring. I laid him out in a second\r\n      with a stick, and Jim grabbed pap’s whisky-jug and begun to pour it\r\n      down.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c10-80\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c10-80.jpg (66K)\" src=\"images/c10-80.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-607134278777338663\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was barefooted, and the snake bit him right on the heel. That all\r\n      comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a\r\n      dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it. Jim told\r\n      me to chop off the snake’s head and throw it away, and then skin the\r\n      body and roast a piece of it. I done it, and he eat it and said it\r\n      would help cure him. He made me take off the rattles and tie them around\r\n      his wrist, too. He said that that would help. Then I slid out\r\n      quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes; for I warn’t\r\n      going to let Jim find out it was all my fault, not if I could help it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head\r\n      and pitched around and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went\r\n      to sucking at the jug again. His foot swelled up pretty big, and so\r\n      did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I judged he was\r\n      all right; but I’d druther been bit with a snake than pap’s\r\n      whisky.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim was laid up for four days and nights. Then the swelling was all\r\n      gone and he was around again. I made up my mind I wouldn’t\r\n      ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands, now that I see what\r\n      had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time. And\r\n      he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we\r\n      hadn’t got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the\r\n      new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a\r\n      snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,\r\n      though I’ve always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your\r\n      left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can\r\n      do. Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged about it; and in less\r\n      than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread\r\n      himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and\r\n      they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him\r\n      so, so they say, but I didn’t see it. Pap told me. But\r\n      anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c10-81\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c10-81.jpg (49K)\" src=\"images/c10-81.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3115359568961694143\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\r\n      again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks\r\n      with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a\r\n      man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred pounds.\r\n      We couldn’t handle him, of course; he would a flung us into\r\n      Illinois. We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till\r\n      he drownded. We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\r\n      ball, and lots of rubbage. We split the ball open with the hatchet,\r\n      and there was a spool in it. Jim said he’d had it there a long\r\n      time, to coat it over so and make a ball of it. It was as big a fish\r\n      as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon. Jim said he hadn’t\r\n      ever seen a bigger one. He would a been worth a good deal over at\r\n      the village. They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the\r\n      market-house there; everybody buys some of him; his meat’s as white\r\n      as snow and makes a good fry.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a\r\n      stirring up some way. I said I reckoned I would slip over the river\r\n      and find out what was going on. Jim liked that notion; but he said I\r\n      must go in the dark and look sharp. Then he studied it over and\r\n      said, couldn’t I put on some of them old things and dress up like a\r\n      girl? That was a good notion, too. So we shortened up one of\r\n      the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into\r\n      it. Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.\r\n      I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a\r\n      body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of\r\n      stove-pipe. Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime,\r\n      hardly. I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things,\r\n      and by and by I could do pretty well in them, only Jim said I didn’t\r\n      walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my\r\n      britches-pocket. I took notice, and done better.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c10-82\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c10-82.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c10-82.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7857122019677215798\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing, and\r\n      the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town. I\r\n      tied up and started along the bank. There was a light burning in a\r\n      little shanty that hadn’t been lived in for a long time, and I\r\n      wondered who had took up quarters there. I slipped up and peeped in\r\n      at the window. There was a woman about forty year old in there\r\n      knitting by a candle that was on a pine table. I didn’t know\r\n      her face; she was a stranger, for you couldn’t start a face in that\r\n      town that I didn’t know. Now this was lucky, because I was\r\n      weakening; I was getting afraid I had come; people might know my voice and\r\n      find me out. But if this woman had been in such a little town two\r\n      days she could tell me all I wanted to know; so I knocked at the door, and\r\n      made up my mind I wouldn’t forget I was a girl.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c11-84\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c11\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c11-84.jpg (141K)\" src=\"images/c11-84.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1384472141625020508\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Come in,” says the woman, and I did. She says: “Take\r\n      a cheer.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I done it. She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What might your name be?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Sarah Williams.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Where ’bouts do you live? In this neighborhood?’ \r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No’m. In Hookerville, seven mile below. I’ve\r\n      walked all the way and I’m all tired out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hungry, too, I reckon. I’ll find you something.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No’m, I ain’t hungry. I was so hungry I had to\r\n      stop two miles below here at a farm; so I ain’t hungry no more.\r\n      It’s what makes me so late. My mother’s down sick, and\r\n      out of money and everything, and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore.\r\n      He lives at the upper end of the town, she says. I hain’t\r\n      ever been here before. Do you know him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No; but I don’t know everybody yet. I haven’t\r\n      lived here quite two weeks. It’s a considerable ways to the upper\r\n      end of the town. You better stay here all night. Take off your\r\n      bonnet.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” I says; “I’ll rest a while, I reckon, and go\r\n      on. I ain’t afeared of the dark.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She said she wouldn’t let me go by myself, but her husband would be\r\n      in by and by, maybe in a hour and a half, and she’d send him along\r\n      with me. Then she got to talking about her husband, and about her\r\n      relations up the river, and her relations down the river, and about how\r\n      much better off they used to was, and how they didn’t know but they’d\r\n      made a mistake coming to our town, instead of letting well alone—and\r\n      so on and so on, till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to\r\n      find out what was going on in the town; but by and by she dropped on to\r\n      pap and the murder, and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right\r\n      along. She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand\r\n      dollars (only she got it ten) and all about pap and what a hard lot he\r\n      was, and what a hard lot I was, and at last she got down to where I was\r\n      murdered. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who done it? We’ve heard considerable about these\r\n      goings on down in Hookerville, but we don’t know who ’twas\r\n      that killed Huck Finn.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I reckon there’s a right smart chance of people <i>here</i>\r\n      that’d like to know who killed him. Some think old Finn done\r\n      it himself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No—is that so?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Most everybody thought it at first. He’ll never know\r\n      how nigh he come to getting lynched. But before night they changed\r\n      around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why <i>he</i>—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I stopped. I reckoned I better keep still. She run on, and\r\n      never noticed I had put in at all:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed. So\r\n      there’s a reward out for him—three hundred dollars. And\r\n      there’s a reward out for old Finn, too—two hundred dollars.\r\n      You see, he come to town the morning after the murder, and told\r\n      about it, and was out with ’em on the ferryboat hunt, and right away\r\n      after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but he\r\n      was gone, you see. Well, next day they found out the nigger was\r\n      gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence ten o’clock the\r\n      night the murder was done. So then they put it on him, you see; and\r\n      while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, and went\r\n      boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over\r\n      Illinois with. The judge gave him some, and that evening he got drunk, and\r\n      was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking\r\n      strangers, and then went off with them. Well, he hain’t come\r\n      back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing\r\n      blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and\r\n      fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get\r\n      Huck’s money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit.\r\n      People do say he warn’t any too good to do it. Oh, he’s\r\n      sly, I reckon. If he don’t come back for a year he’ll be\r\n      all right. You can’t prove anything on him, you know;\r\n      everything will be quieted down then, and he’ll walk in Huck’s\r\n      money as easy as nothing.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, I reckon so, ’m. I don’t see nothing in the\r\n      way of it. Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, no, not everybody. A good many thinks he done it. But\r\n      they’ll get the nigger pretty soon now, and maybe they can scare it\r\n      out of him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, are they after him yet?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you’re innocent, ain’t you! Does three\r\n      hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up? Some\r\n      folks think the nigger ain’t far from here. I’m one of\r\n      them—but I hain’t talked it around. A few days ago I was\r\n      talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty, and\r\n      they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder\r\n      that they call Jackson’s Island. Don’t anybody live\r\n      there? says I. No, nobody, says they. I didn’t say any more,\r\n      but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I’d seen\r\n      smoke over there, about the head of the island, a day or two before that,\r\n      so I says to myself, like as not that nigger’s hiding over there;\r\n      anyway, says I, it’s worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.\r\n      I hain’t seen any smoke sence, so I reckon maybe he’s\r\n      gone, if it was him; but husband’s going over to see—him and\r\n      another man. He was gone up the river; but he got back to-day, and I\r\n      told him as soon as he got here two hours ago.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c11-87\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c11-87.jpg (46K)\" src=\"images/c11-87.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4853832517579512077\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had got so uneasy I couldn’t set still. I had to do\r\n      something with my hands; so I took up a needle off of the table and went\r\n      to threading it. My hands shook, and I was making a bad job of it. When\r\n      the woman stopped talking I looked up, and she was looking at me pretty\r\n      curious and smiling a little. I put down the needle and thread, and\r\n      let on to be interested—and I was, too—and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Three hundred dollars is a power of money. I wish my mother\r\n      could get it. Is your husband going over there to-night?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes. He went up-town with the man I was telling you of,\r\n      to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun. They’ll\r\n      go over after midnight.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Couldn’t they see better if they was to wait till daytime?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes. And couldn’t the nigger see better, too? After\r\n      midnight he’ll likely be asleep, and they can slip around through\r\n      the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark, if he’s\r\n      got one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I didn’t think of that.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The woman kept looking at me pretty curious, and I didn’t feel a bit\r\n      comfortable. Pretty soon she says,\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did you say your name was, honey?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “M—Mary Williams.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Somehow it didn’t seem to me that I said it was Mary before, so I\r\n      didn’t look up—seemed to me I said it was Sarah; so I felt\r\n      sort of cornered, and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too. I\r\n      wished the woman would say something more; the longer she set still the\r\n      uneasier I was. But now she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes’m, I did. Sarah Mary Williams. Sarah’s\r\n      my first name. Some calls me Sarah, some calls me Mary.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, that’s the way of it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes’m.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was feeling better then, but I wished I was out of there, anyway. I\r\n      couldn’t look up yet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\r\n      they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place,\r\n      and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again. She was right\r\n      about the rats. You’d see one stick his nose out of a hole in the\r\n      corner every little while. She said she had to have things handy to\r\n      throw at them when she was alone, or they wouldn’t give her no\r\n      peace. She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said\r\n      she was a good shot with it generly, but she’d wrenched her arm a\r\n      day or two ago, and didn’t know whether she could throw true now.\r\n      But she watched for a chance, and directly banged away at a rat; but\r\n      she missed him wide, and said “Ouch!” it hurt her arm so.\r\n      Then she told me to try for the next one. I wanted to be\r\n      getting away before the old man got back, but of course I didn’t let\r\n      on. I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his nose I let\r\n      drive, and if he’d a stayed where he was he’d a been a\r\n      tolerable sick rat. She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\r\n      would hive the next one. She went and got the lump of lead and\r\n      fetched it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to\r\n      help her with. I held up my two hands and she put the hank over\r\n      them, and went on talking about her and her husband’s matters.\r\n      But she broke off to say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Keep your eye on the rats. You better have the lead in your\r\n      lap, handy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped my\r\n      legs together on it and she went on talking. But only about a\r\n      minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face, and\r\n      very pleasant, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Come, now, what’s your real name?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Wh—what, mum?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s your real name? Is it Bill, or Tom, or Bob?—or\r\n      what is it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I reckon I shook like a leaf, and I didn’t know hardly what to do.\r\n      But I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Please to don’t poke fun at a poor girl like me, mum. If\r\n      I’m in the way here, I’ll—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, you won’t. Set down and stay where you are. I\r\n      ain’t going to hurt you, and I ain’t going to tell on you,\r\n      nuther. You just tell me your secret, and trust me. I’ll\r\n      keep it; and, what’s more, I’ll help you. So’ll my old\r\n      man if you want him to. You see, you’re a runaway ’prentice,\r\n      that’s all. It ain’t anything. There ain’t\r\n      no harm in it. You’ve been treated bad, and you made up your mind to\r\n      cut. Bless you, child, I wouldn’t tell on you. Tell me\r\n      all about it now, that’s a good boy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I said it wouldn’t be no use to try to play it any longer, and I\r\n      would just make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn’t\r\n      go back on her promise. Then I told her my father and mother was\r\n      dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country\r\n      thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn’t\r\n      stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I\r\n      took my chance and stole some of his daughter’s old clothes and\r\n      cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I\r\n      traveled nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat\r\n      I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I\r\n      said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that\r\n      was why I struck out for this town of Goshen.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Goshen, child? This ain’t Goshen. This is St.\r\n      Petersburg. Goshen’s ten mile further up the river. Who\r\n      told you this was Goshen?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to\r\n      turn into the woods for my regular sleep. He told me when the roads\r\n      forked I must take the right hand, and five mile would fetch me to Goshen.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He was drunk, I reckon. He told you just exactly wrong.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, he did act like he was drunk, but it ain’t no matter\r\n      now. I got to be moving along. I’ll fetch Goshen before\r\n      daylight.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on a minute. I’ll put you up a snack to eat.\r\n      You might want it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c11-90\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c11-90.jpg (57K)\" src=\"images/c11-90.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6187062130561193009\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So she put me up a snack, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say, when a cow’s laying down, which end of her gets up\r\n      first? Answer up prompt now—don’t stop to study over it.\r\n      Which end gets up first?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The hind end, mum.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, a horse?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The for’rard end, mum.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Which side of a tree does the moss grow on?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “North side.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside, how many of them eats\r\n      with their heads pointed the same direction?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The whole fifteen, mum.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I reckon you <i>have</i> lived in the country. I\r\n      thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again. What’s your\r\n      real name, now?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “George Peters, mum.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, try to remember it, George. Don’t forget and tell\r\n      me it’s Elexander before you go, and then get out by saying it’s\r\n      George Elexander when I catch you. And don’t go about women in\r\n      that old calico. You do a girl tolerable poor, but you might fool\r\n      men, maybe. Bless you, child, when you set out to thread a needle\r\n      don’t hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it; hold the\r\n      needle still and poke the thread at it; that’s the way a woman most\r\n      always does, but a man always does t’other way. And when you\r\n      throw at a rat or anything, hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand\r\n      up over your head as awkward as you can, and miss your rat about six or\r\n      seven foot. Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder, like there was a pivot\r\n      there for it to turn on, like a girl; not from the wrist and elbow, with\r\n      your arm out to one side, like a boy. And, mind you, when a girl\r\n      tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart; she don’t\r\n      clap them together, the way you did when you catched the lump of lead.\r\n      Why, I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle; and\r\n      I contrived the other things just to make certain. Now trot along to\r\n      your uncle, Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters, and if you get\r\n      into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus, which is me, and I’ll\r\n      do what I can to get you out of it. Keep the river road all the way,\r\n      and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you. The river road’s\r\n      a rocky one, and your feet’ll be in a condition when you get to\r\n      Goshen, I reckon.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went up the bank about fifty yards, and then I doubled on my tracks and\r\n      slipped back to where my canoe was, a good piece below the house. I\r\n      jumped in, and was off in a hurry. I went up-stream far enough to\r\n      make the head of the island, and then started across. I took off the\r\n      sun-bonnet, for I didn’t want no blinders on then. When I was\r\n      about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike, so I stops and\r\n      listens; the sound come faint over the water but clear—eleven.\r\n      When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow, though\r\n      I was most winded, but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp\r\n      used to be, and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place, a mile and a half\r\n      below, as hard as I could go. I landed, and slopped through the\r\n      timber and up the ridge and into the cavern. There Jim laid, sound\r\n      asleep on the ground. I roused him out and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Git up and hump yourself, Jim! There ain’t a minute to\r\n      lose. They’re after us!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c11-91\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c11-91.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c11-91.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1866787017514156399\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim never asked no questions, he never said a word; but the way he worked\r\n      for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared. By that\r\n      time everything we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to\r\n      be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the\r\n      camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn’t show a candle\r\n      outside after that.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece, and took a look; but\r\n      if there was a boat around I couldn’t see it, for stars and shadows\r\n      ain’t good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped\r\n      along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still—never\r\n      saying a word.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c12-093\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c12\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c12-093.jpg (173K)\" src=\"images/c12-093.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3190318396770923496\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It must a been close on to one o’clock when we got below the island\r\n      at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to\r\n      come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\r\n      shore; and it was well a boat didn’t come, for we hadn’t ever\r\n      thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to\r\n      eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many\r\n      things. It warn’t good judgment to put <i>everything</i> on\r\n      the raft.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\r\n      built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they\r\n      stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn’t\r\n      no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\r\n      big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the\r\n      hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had\r\n      been a cave-in in the bank there. A tow-head is a sandbar that has\r\n      cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\r\n      side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\r\n      warn’t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all\r\n      day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore,\r\n      and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told\r\n      Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she\r\n      was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn’t\r\n      set down and watch a camp fire—no, sir, she’d fetch a dog.\r\n      Well, then, I said, why couldn’t she tell her husband to fetch\r\n      a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was\r\n      ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and\r\n      so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn’t be here on a towhead\r\n      sixteen or seventeen mile below the village—no, indeedy, we would be\r\n      in that same old town again. So I said I didn’t care what was\r\n      the reason they didn’t get us as long as they didn’t.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\r\n      cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\r\n      so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam\r\n      to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim\r\n      made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level\r\n      of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of\r\n      steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer\r\n      of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold\r\n      it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly;\r\n      the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra\r\n      steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or\r\n      something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on,\r\n      because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\r\n      coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn’t\r\n      have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they\r\n      call a “crossing”; for the river was pretty high yet, very low\r\n      banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn’t\r\n      always run the channel, but hunted easy water.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\r\n      that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked,\r\n      and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind\r\n      of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\r\n      up at the stars, and we didn’t ever feel like talking loud, and it\r\n      warn’t often that we laughed—only a little kind of a low\r\n      chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing\r\n      ever happened to us at all—that night, nor the next, nor the next.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\r\n      nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The\r\n      fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\r\n      In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\r\n      people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\r\n      spread of lights at two o’clock that still night. There warn’t\r\n      a sound there; everybody was asleep.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o’clock at some\r\n      little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents’ worth of meal or bacon\r\n      or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn’t\r\n      roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a\r\n      chicken when you get a chance, because if you don’t want him\r\n      yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain’t\r\n      ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn’t want the chicken\r\n      himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c12-095\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c12-095.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c12-095.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1337641283554975426\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\r\n      watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\r\n      that kind. Pap always said it warn’t no harm to borrow things\r\n      if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn’t\r\n      anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\r\n      Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\r\n      right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\r\n      from the list and say we wouldn’t borrow them any more—then he\r\n      reckoned it wouldn’t be no harm to borrow the others. So we\r\n      talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to\r\n      make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or\r\n      the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled\r\n      satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p’simmons. We\r\n      warn’t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable\r\n      now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain’t\r\n      ever good, and the p’simmons wouldn’t be ripe for two or three\r\n      months yet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or\r\n      didn’t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all\r\n      round, we lived pretty high.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a\r\n      power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet.\r\n      We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the\r\n      lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high,\r\n      rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, “Hel-<i>lo</i>,\r\n      Jim, looky yonder!” It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a\r\n      rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning\r\n      showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her\r\n      upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean\r\n      and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on\r\n      the back of it, when the flashes come.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I\r\n      felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying\r\n      there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted\r\n      to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was\r\n      there. So I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Le’s land on her, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But Jim was dead against it at first. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I doan’ want to go fool’n ’long er no wrack.\r\n      We’s doin’ blame’ well, en we better let blame’ \r\n      well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey’s a watchman\r\n      on dat wrack.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Watchman your grandmother,” I says; “there ain’t\r\n      nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon\r\n      anybody’s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such\r\n      a night as this, when it’s likely to break up and wash off down the\r\n      river any minute?” Jim couldn’t say nothing to that, so\r\n      he didn’t try. “And besides,” I says, “we might\r\n      borrow something worth having out of the captain’s stateroom. Seegars,\r\n      I bet you—and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat\r\n      captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and <i>they</i>\r\n      don’t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want\r\n      it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can’t rest, Jim, till we\r\n      give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this\r\n      thing? Not for pie, he wouldn’t. He’d call it an\r\n      adventure—that’s what he’d call it; and he’d land\r\n      on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn’t he throw\r\n      style into it?—wouldn’t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why,\r\n      you’d think it was Christopher C’lumbus discovering\r\n      Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer <i>was</i> here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn’t talk\r\n      any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning\r\n      showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard\r\n      derrick, and made fast there.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to\r\n      labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\r\n      feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark\r\n      we couldn’t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the\r\n      forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched\r\n      us in front of the captain’s door, which was open, and by Jimminy,\r\n      away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same\r\n      second we seem to hear low voices in yonder!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\r\n      along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but\r\n      just then I heard a voice wail out and say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, please don’t, boys; I swear I won’t ever tell!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Another voice said, pretty loud:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a lie, Jim Turner. You’ve acted this way\r\n      before. You always want more’n your share of the truck, and\r\n      you’ve always got it, too, because you’ve swore ’t if\r\n      you didn’t you’d tell. But this time you’ve said\r\n      it jest one time too many. You’re the meanest, treacherousest\r\n      hound in this country.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with\r\n      curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn’t back out now,\r\n      and so I won’t either; I’m a-going to see what’s going\r\n      on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage,\r\n      and crept aft in the dark till there warn’t but one stateroom\r\n      betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a\r\n      man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing\r\n      over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one\r\n      had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man’s\r\n      head on the floor, and saying:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’d <i>like</i> to! And I orter, too—a mean\r\n      skunk!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c12-098\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c12-098.jpg (66K)\" src=\"images/c12-098.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8266776668650826307\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, “Oh, please don’t,\r\n      Bill; I hain’t ever goin’ to tell.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “’Deed you <i>ain’t!</i> You never said no truer\r\n      thing ’n that, you bet you.” And once he said: “Hear him\r\n      beg! and yit if we hadn’t got the best of him and tied him he’d\r\n      a killed us both. And what <i>for</i>? Jist for noth’n.\r\n      Jist because we stood on our <i>rights</i>—that’s what for.\r\n      But I lay you ain’t a-goin’ to threaten nobody any more,\r\n      Jim Turner. Put <i>up</i> that pistol, Bill.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Bill says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t want to, Jake Packard. I’m for killin’ \r\n      him—and didn’t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way—and\r\n      don’t he deserve it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But I don’t <i>want</i> him killed, and I’ve got my\r\n      reasons for it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Bless yo’ heart for them words, Jake Packard! I’ll\r\n      never forgit you long’s I live!” says the man on the floor,\r\n      sort of blubbering.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Packard didn’t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a\r\n      nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\r\n      to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the\r\n      boat slanted so that I couldn’t make very good time; so to keep from\r\n      getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side.\r\n      The man came a-pawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my\r\n      stateroom, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here—come in here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up\r\n      in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood\r\n      there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I\r\n      couldn’t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky\r\n      they’d been having. I was glad I didn’t drink whisky;\r\n      but it wouldn’t made much difference anyway, because most of the\r\n      time they couldn’t a treed me because I didn’t breathe. I\r\n      was too scared. And, besides, a body <i>couldn’t</i> breathe\r\n      and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted\r\n      to kill Turner. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He’s said he’ll tell, and he will. If we was to\r\n      give both our shares to him <i>now</i> it wouldn’t make no\r\n      difference after the row and the way we’ve served him. Shore’s\r\n      you’re born, he’ll turn State’s evidence; now you hear\r\n      <i>me</i>. I’m for putting him out of his troubles.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So’m I,” says Packard, very quiet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blame it, I’d sorter begun to think you wasn’t. Well,\r\n      then, that’s all right. Le’s go and do it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on a minute; I hain’t had my say yit. You listen\r\n      to me. Shooting’s good, but there’s quieter ways if the thing’s\r\n      <i>got</i> to be done. But what I say is this: it ain’t good\r\n      sense to go court’n around after a halter if you can git at what you’re\r\n      up to in some way that’s jist as good and at the same time don’t\r\n      bring you into no resks. Ain’t that so?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You bet it is. But how you goin’ to manage it this\r\n      time?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, my idea is this: we’ll rustle around and gather\r\n      up whatever pickins we’ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove\r\n      for shore and hide the truck. Then we’ll wait. Now I say it\r\n      ain’t a-goin’ to be more’n two hours befo’ this\r\n      wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He’ll be\r\n      drownded, and won’t have nobody to blame for it but his own self.\r\n      I reckon that’s a considerble sight better ’n killin’ \r\n      of him. I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you\r\n      can git aroun’ it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good\r\n      morals. Ain’t I right?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c12-100\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c12-100.jpg (69K)\" src=\"images/c12-100.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-543523898989305004\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, I reck’n you are.

It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse\r\n      whisper, “Jim!” and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a\r\n      sort of a moan, and I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Quick, Jim, it ain’t no time for fooling around and moaning;\r\n      there’s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don’t hunt up\r\n      their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can’t\r\n      get away from the wreck there’s one of ’em going to be in a\r\n      bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put <i>all</i> of ’em\r\n      in a bad fix—for the sheriff ’ll get ’em. Quick—hurry!\r\n      I’ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard.

Shut up on a wreck with\r\n      such a gang as that! But it warn’t no time to be\r\n      sentimentering. We’d <i>got</i> to find that boat now—had\r\n      to have it for ourselves. So we went a-quaking and shaking down the\r\n      stabboard side, and slow work it was, too—seemed a week before we\r\n      got to the stern. No sign of a boat. Jim said he didn’t\r\n      believe he could go any further—so scared he hadn’t hardly any\r\n      strength left, he said. But I said, come on, if we get left on this\r\n      wreck we are in a fix, sure. So on we prowled again. We struck\r\n      for the stern of the texas, and found it, and then scrabbled along\r\n      forwards on the skylight, hanging on from shutter to shutter, for the edge\r\n      of the skylight was in the water. When we got pretty close to the\r\n      cross-hall door there was the skiff, sure enough! I could just\r\n      barely see her. I felt ever so thankful. In another second I\r\n      would a been aboard of her, but just then the door opened. One of\r\n      the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me, and I\r\n      thought I was gone; but he jerked it in again, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Heave that blame lantern out o’ sight, Bill!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He flung a bag of something into the boat, and then got in himself and set\r\n      down. It was Packard. Then Bill <i>he</i> come out and got in.\r\n      Packard says, in a low voice:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All ready—shove off!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I couldn’t hardly hang on to the shutters, I was so weak. But\r\n      Bill says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on—’d you go through him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No. Didn’t you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No. So he’s got his share o’ the cash yet.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, come along; no use to take truck and leave money.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say, won’t he suspicion what we’re up to?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Maybe he won’t. But we got to have it anyway. Come\r\n      along.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they got out and went in.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The door slammed to because it was on the careened side; and in a half\r\n      second I was in the boat, and Jim come tumbling after me. I out with\r\n      my knife and cut the rope, and away we went!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We didn’t touch an oar, and we didn’t speak nor whisper, nor\r\n      hardly even breathe. We went gliding swift along, dead silent, past\r\n      the tip of the paddle-box, and past the stern; then in a second or two\r\n      more we was a hundred yards below the wreck, and the darkness soaked her\r\n      up, every last sign of her, and we was safe, and knowed it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern\r\n      show like a little spark at the texas door for a second, and we knowed by\r\n      that that the rascals had missed their boat, and was beginning to\r\n      understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then Jim manned the oars, and we took out after our raft. Now was\r\n      the first time that I begun to worry about the men—I reckon I hadn’t\r\n      had time to before. I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for\r\n      murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain’t\r\n      no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet, and then how\r\n      would I like it? So says I to Jim:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The first light we see we’ll land a hundred yards below it or\r\n      above it, in a place where it’s a good hiding-place for you and the\r\n      skiff, and then I’ll go and fix up some kind of a yarn, and get\r\n      somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape, so they can\r\n      be hung when their time comes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But that idea was a failure; for pretty soon it begun to storm again, and\r\n      this time worse than ever. The rain poured down, and never a light\r\n      showed; everybody in bed, I reckon. We boomed along down the river,\r\n      watching for lights and watching for our raft. After a long time the\r\n      rain let up, but the clouds stayed, and the lightning kept whimpering, and\r\n      by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead, floating, and we made for\r\n      it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was the raft, and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again. We\r\n      seen a light now away down to the right, on shore. So I said I would\r\n      go for it. The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole\r\n      there on the wreck. We hustled it on to the raft in a pile, and I\r\n      told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone\r\n      about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and\r\n      shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more\r\n      showed—up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in\r\n      above the shore light, and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by\r\n      I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull\r\n      ferryboat. I skimmed around for the watchman, a-wondering\r\n      whereabouts he slept; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts\r\n      forward, with his head down between his knees. I gave his shoulder\r\n      two or three little shoves, and begun to cry.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way; but when he see it was only me\r\n      he took a good gap and stretch, and then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello, what’s up? Don’t cry, bub. What’s\r\n      the trouble?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c13-104\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c13-104.jpg (69K)\" src=\"images/c13-104.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5404763635486634323\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Pap, and mam, and sis, and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I broke down.

What’s\r\n      the matter with ’em?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “They’re—they’re—are you the watchman of the\r\n      boat?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” he says, kind of pretty-well-satisfied like. “I’m\r\n      the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head\r\n      deck-hand; and sometimes I’m the freight and passengers. I ain’t\r\n      as rich as old Jim Hornback, and I can’t be so blame’ generous\r\n      and good to Tom, Dick, and Harry as what he is, and slam around money the\r\n      way he does; but I’ve told him a many a time ’t I wouldn’t\r\n      trade places with him; for, says I, a sailor’s life’s the life\r\n      for me, and I’m derned if <i>I’d</i> live two mile out o’ \r\n      town, where there ain’t nothing ever goin’ on, not for all his\r\n      spondulicks and as much more on top of it. Says I—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I broke in and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “They’re in an awful peck of trouble, and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Who</i> is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker; and if you’d take\r\n      your ferryboat and go up there—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Up where?

It’s the beatenest thing I ever struck.\r\n      And <i>then</i> what did you all do?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, we hollered and took on, but it’s so wide there we\r\n      couldn’t make nobody hear. So pap said somebody got to get\r\n      ashore and get help somehow. I was the only one that could swim, so I made\r\n      a dash for it, and Miss Hooker she said if I didn’t strike help\r\n      sooner, come here and hunt up her uncle, and he’d fix the thing.\r\n      I made the land about a mile below, and been fooling along ever\r\n      since, trying to get people to do something, but they said, ’What,\r\n      in such a night and such a current? There ain’t no sense in it; go\r\n      for the steam ferry.’ Now if you’ll go and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “By Jackson, I’d <i>like</i> to, and, blame it, I don’t\r\n      know but I will; but who in the dingnation’s a-going’ to <i>pay</i>\r\n      for it? Do you reckon your pap—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why <i>that’s</i> all right. Miss Hooker she tole me,\r\n      <i>particular</i>, that her uncle Hornback—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Great guns! is <i>he</i> her uncle? Looky here, you break for\r\n      that light over yonder-way, and turn out west when you git there, and\r\n      about a quarter of a mile out you’ll come to the tavern; tell\r\n      ’em to dart you out to Jim Hornback’s, and he’ll foot\r\n      the bill. And don’t you fool around any, because he’ll\r\n      want to know the news. Tell him I’ll have his niece all safe\r\n      before he can get to town. Hump yourself, now; I’m a-going up\r\n      around the corner here to roust out my engineer.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I struck for the light, but as soon as he turned the corner I went back\r\n      and got into my skiff and bailed her out, and then pulled up shore in the\r\n      easy water about six hundred yards, and tucked myself in among some\r\n      woodboats; for I couldn’t rest easy till I could see the ferryboat\r\n      start. But take it all around, I was feeling ruther comfortable on\r\n      accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang, for not many would a\r\n      done it. I wished the widow knowed about it. I judged she\r\n      would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions, because rapscallions\r\n      and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most\r\n      interest in.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c13-107\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c13-107.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c13-107.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-11874372296790392\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, before long here comes the wreck, dim and dusky, sliding along down!\r\n      A kind of cold shiver went through me, and then I struck out for her.\r\n      She was very deep, and I see in a minute there warn’t much\r\n      chance for anybody being alive in her. I pulled all around her and\r\n      hollered a little, but there wasn’t any answer; all dead still.\r\n      I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang, but not much, for\r\n      I reckoned if they could stand it I could.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then here comes the ferryboat; so I shoved for the middle of the river on\r\n      a long down-stream slant; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid\r\n      on my oars, and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for\r\n      Miss Hooker’s remainders, because the captain would know her uncle\r\n      Hornback would want them; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up\r\n      and went for the shore, and I laid into my work and went a-booming down\r\n      the river.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It did seem a powerful long time before Jim’s light showed up; and\r\n      when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off.

We hadn’t ever been this rich before in neither of\r\n      our lives. The seegars was prime. We laid off all the\r\n      afternoon in the woods talking, and me reading the books, and having a\r\n      general good time. I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and\r\n      at the ferryboat, and I said these kinds of things was adventures; but he\r\n      said he didn’t want no more adventures. He said that when I\r\n      went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her\r\n      gone he nearly died, because he judged it was all up with <i>him</i>\r\n      anyway it could be fixed; for if he didn’t get saved he would get\r\n      drownded; and if he did get saved, whoever saved him would send him back\r\n      home so as to get the reward, and then Miss Watson would sell him South,\r\n      sure. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an\r\n      uncommon level head for a nigger.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such, and\r\n      how gaudy they dressed, and how much style they put on, and called each\r\n      other your majesty, and your grace, and your lordship, and so on, ’stead\r\n      of mister; and Jim’s eyes bugged out, and he was interested.

I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern, and\r\n      grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke. But she didn’t\r\n      come. I was in such a hurry I hadn’t untied her.

That was all right as far as it went, but the\r\n      towhead warn’t sixty yards long, and the minute I flew by the foot\r\n      of it I shot out into the solid white fog, and hadn’t no more idea\r\n      which way I was going than a dead man.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Thinks I, it won’t do to paddle; first I know I’ll run into\r\n      the bank or a towhead or something; I got to set still and float, and yet\r\n      it’s mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at\r\n      such a time. I whooped and listened. Away down there\r\n      somewheres I hears a small whoop, and up comes my spirits. I went\r\n      tearing after it, listening sharp to hear it again. The next time it\r\n      come I see I warn’t heading for it, but heading away to the right of\r\n      it. And the next time I was heading away to the left of it—and\r\n      not gaining on it much either, for I was flying around, this way and that\r\n      and t’other, but it was going straight ahead all the time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan, and beat it all the\r\n      time, but he never did, and it was the still places between the whoops\r\n      that was making the trouble for me. Well, I fought along, and\r\n      directly I hears the whoop <i>behind</i> me. I was tangled good now.\r\n      That was somebody else’s whoop, or else I was turned around.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I throwed the paddle down. I heard the whoop again; it was behind me\r\n      yet, but in a different place; it kept coming, and kept changing its\r\n      place, and I kept answering, till by and by it was in front of me again,\r\n      and I knowed the current had swung the canoe’s head down-stream, and\r\n      I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering.\r\n      I couldn’t tell nothing about voices in a fog, for nothing don’t\r\n      look natural nor sound natural in a fog.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The whooping went on, and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut\r\n      bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it, and the current throwed me off\r\n      to the left and shot by, amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared, the\r\n      currrent was tearing by them so swift.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In another second or two it was solid white and still again. I set\r\n      perfectly still then, listening to my heart thump, and I reckon I didn’t\r\n      draw a breath while it thumped a hundred.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I just give up then. I knowed what the matter was. That cut\r\n      bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t’other side of it. It\r\n      warn’t no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It\r\n      had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long\r\n      and more than half a mile wide.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, about fifteen minutes, I reckon. I\r\n      was floating along, of course, four or five miles an hour; but you don’t\r\n      ever think of that. No, you <i>feel</i> like you are laying dead\r\n      still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don’t\r\n      think to yourself how fast <i>you’re</i> going, but you catch your\r\n      breath and think, my! how that snag’s tearing along. If you\r\n      think it ain’t dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself\r\n      in the night, you try it once—you’ll see.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c15-117\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c15-117.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c15-117.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2932222060642125230\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next, for about a half an hour, I whoops now and then; at last I hears the\r\n      answer a long ways off, and tries to follow it, but I couldn’t do\r\n      it, and directly I judged I’d got into a nest of towheads, for I had\r\n      little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me—sometimes just a\r\n      narrow channel between, and some that I couldn’t see I knowed was\r\n      there because I’d hear the wash of the current against the old dead\r\n      brush and trash that hung over the banks. Well, I warn’t long\r\n      loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads; and I only tried to chase\r\n      them a little while, anyway, because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o’-lantern.\r\n      You never knowed a sound dodge around so, and swap places so quick\r\n      and so much.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times, to keep\r\n      from knocking the islands out of the river; and so I judged the raft must\r\n      be butting into the bank every now and then, or else it would get further\r\n      ahead and clear out of hearing—it was floating a little faster than\r\n      what I was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I seemed to be in the open river again by and by, but I couldn’t\r\n      hear no sign of a whoop nowheres. I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a\r\n      snag, maybe, and it was all up with him. I was good and tired, so I\r\n      laid down in the canoe and said I wouldn’t bother no more. I\r\n      didn’t want to go to sleep, of course; but I was so sleepy I couldn’t\r\n      help it; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c15-118\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c15-118.jpg (78K)\" src=\"images/c15-118.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5752928437442785274\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap, for when I waked up the stars was\r\n      shining bright, the fog was all gone, and I was spinning down a big bend\r\n      stern first. First I didn’t know where I was; I thought I was\r\n      dreaming; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up\r\n      dim out of last week.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was a monstrous big river here, with the tallest and the thickest kind\r\n      of timber on both banks; just a solid wall, as well as I could see by the\r\n      stars. I looked away down-stream, and seen a black speck on the\r\n      water. I took after it; but when I got to it it warn’t nothing but a\r\n      couple of sawlogs made fast together. Then I see another speck, and\r\n      chased that; then another, and this time I was right. It was the\r\n      raft.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his\r\n      knees, asleep, with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar. The\r\n      other oar was smashed off, and the raft was littered up with leaves and\r\n      branches and dirt. So she’d had a rough time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I made fast and laid down under Jim’s nose on the raft, and began to\r\n      gap, and stretch my fists out against Jim, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello, Jim, have I been asleep? Why didn’t you stir me\r\n      up?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Goodness gracious, is dat you, Huck? En you ain’ dead—you\r\n      ain’ drownded—you’s back agin? It’s too good\r\n      for true, honey, it’s too good for true. Lemme look at you chile,\r\n      lemme feel o’ you. No, you ain’ dead! you’s back\r\n      agin, ’live en soun’, jis de same ole Huck—de same ole\r\n      Huck, thanks to goodness!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s the matter with you, Jim? You been a-drinking?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Drinkin’? Has I ben a-drinkin’? Has I had a\r\n      chance to be a-drinkin’?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what makes you talk so wild?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How does I talk wild?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>How</i>? Why, hain’t you been talking about my\r\n      coming back, and all that stuff, as if I’d been gone away?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Huck—Huck Finn, you look me in de eye; look me in de eye.\r\n      <i>Hain’t</i> you ben gone away?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gone away? Why, what in the nation do you mean? I hain’t\r\n      been gone anywheres. Where would I go to?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, looky here, boss, dey’s sumf’n wrong, dey is.\r\n      Is I <i>me</i>, or who <i>is</i> I? Is I heah, or whah <i>is</i> I?\r\n      Now dat’s what I wants to know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I think you’re here, plain enough, but I think you’re\r\n      a tangle-headed old fool, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I is, is I? Well, you answer me dis: Didn’t you\r\n      tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas’ to de tow-head?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, I didn’t. What tow-head? I hain’t see\r\n      no tow-head.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You hain’t seen no towhead? Looky here, didn’t de\r\n      line pull loose en de raf’ go a-hummin’ down de river, en\r\n      leave you en de canoe behine in de fog?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What fog?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, de fog!—de fog dat’s been aroun’ all night.\r\n      En didn’t you whoop, en didn’t I whoop, tell we got mix’ \r\n      up in de islands en one un us got los’ en t’other one was jis’ \r\n      as good as los’, ’kase he didn’ know whah he wuz? En\r\n      didn’t I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time\r\n      en mos’ git drownded? Now ain’ dat so, boss—ain’t\r\n      it so? You answer me dat.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, this is too many for me, Jim. I hain’t seen no\r\n      fog, nor no islands, nor no troubles, nor nothing. I been setting\r\n      here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes\r\n      ago, and I reckon I done the same. You couldn’t a got drunk in\r\n      that time, so of course you’ve been dreaming.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dad fetch it, how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, hang it all, you did dream it, because there didn’t any\r\n      of it happen.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But, Huck, it’s all jis’ as plain to me as—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It don’t make no difference how plain it is; there ain’t\r\n      nothing in it. I know, because I’ve been here all the time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim didn’t say nothing for about five minutes, but set there\r\n      studying over it. Then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, den, I reck’n I did dream it, Huck; but dog my cats ef\r\n      it ain’t de powerfullest dream I ever see. En I hain’t\r\n      ever had no dream b’fo’ dat’s tired me like dis one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, well, that’s all right, because a dream does tire a body\r\n      like everything sometimes. But this one was a staving dream; tell me\r\n      all about it, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through, just as it\r\n      happened, only he painted it up considerable. Then he said he must\r\n      start in and “’terpret” it, because it was sent for a\r\n      warning. He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to\r\n      do us some good, but the current was another man that would get us away\r\n      from him. The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now\r\n      and then, and if we didn’t try hard to make out to understand them\r\n      they’d just take us into bad luck, ’stead of keeping us out of\r\n      it. The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with\r\n      quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks, but if we minded our\r\n      business and didn’t talk back and aggravate them, we would pull\r\n      through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river, which was the\r\n      free States, and wouldn’t have no more trouble.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft, but it was\r\n      clearing up again now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, well, that’s all interpreted well enough as far as it\r\n      goes, Jim,” I says; “but what does <i>these</i> things stand\r\n      for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar. You\r\n      could see them first-rate now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim looked at the trash, and then looked at me, and back at the trash\r\n      again. He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he\r\n      couldn’t seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its\r\n      place again right away. But when he did get the thing straightened\r\n      around he looked at me steady without ever smiling, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do dey stan’ for? I’se gwyne to tell you.\r\n      When I got all wore out wid work, en wid de callin’ for you,\r\n      en went to sleep, my heart wuz mos’ broke bekase you wuz los’,\r\n      en I didn’ k’yer no’ mo’ what become er me en de\r\n      raf’. En when I wake up en fine you back agin, all safe en\r\n      soun’, de tears come, en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo’ \r\n      foot, I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin’ ’bout wuz\r\n      how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie. Dat truck dah is <i>trash</i>;\r\n      en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren’s en\r\n      makes ’em ashamed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam, and went in there without\r\n      saying anything but that. But that was enough. It made me feel\r\n      so mean I could almost kissed <i>his</i> foot to get him to take it back.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble\r\n      myself to a nigger; but I done it, and I warn’t ever sorry for it\r\n      afterwards, neither. I didn’t do him no more mean tricks, and\r\n      I wouldn’t done that one if I’d a knowed it would make him\r\n      feel that way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c16-122\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c16\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c16-122.jpg (173K)\" src=\"images/c16-122.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1530679510546533868\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We slept most all day, and started out at night, a little ways behind a\r\n      monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession. She\r\n      had four long sweeps at each end, so we judged she carried as many as\r\n      thirty men, likely. She had five big wigwams aboard, wide apart, and\r\n      an open camp fire in the middle, and a tall flag-pole at each end. There\r\n      was a power of style about her. It <i>amounted</i> to something\r\n      being a raftsman on such a craft as that.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We went drifting down into a big bend, and the night clouded up and got\r\n      hot. The river was very wide, and was walled with solid timber on\r\n      both sides; you couldn’t see a break in it hardly ever, or a light.\r\n      We talked about Cairo, and wondered whether we would know it when we\r\n      got to it. I said likely we wouldn’t, because I had heard say\r\n      there warn’t but about a dozen houses there, and if they didn’t\r\n      happen to have them lit up, how was we going to know we was passing a\r\n      town? Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there, that\r\n      would show. But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot\r\n      of an island and coming into the same old river again. That disturbed Jim—and\r\n      me too. So the question was, what to do? I said, paddle ashore\r\n      the first time a light showed, and tell them pap was behind, coming along\r\n      with a trading-scow, and was a green hand at the business, and wanted to\r\n      know how far it was to Cairo. Jim thought it was a good idea, so we\r\n      took a smoke on it and waited.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There warn’t nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town,\r\n      and not pass it without seeing it. He said he’d be mighty sure\r\n      to see it, because he’d be a free man the minute he seen it, but if\r\n      he missed it he’d be in a slave country again and no more show for\r\n      freedom. Every little while he jumps up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dah she is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But it warn’t. It was Jack-o’-lanterns, or lightning\r\n      bugs; so he set down again, and went to watching, same as before. Jim\r\n      said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.\r\n      Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too,\r\n      to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he <i>was</i>\r\n      most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, <i>me</i>. I\r\n      couldn’t get that out of my conscience, no how nor no way. It got to\r\n      troubling me so I couldn’t rest; I couldn’t stay still in one\r\n      place. It hadn’t ever come home to me before, what this thing\r\n      was that I was doing. But now it did; and it stayed with me, and\r\n      scorched me more and more. I tried to make out to myself that I warn’t\r\n      to blame, because I didn’t run Jim off from his rightful owner; but\r\n      it warn’t no use, conscience up and says, every time, “But you\r\n      knowed he was running for his freedom, and you could a paddled ashore and\r\n      told somebody.” That was so—I couldn’t get around\r\n      that noway. That was where it pinched. Conscience says to me,\r\n      “What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger\r\n      go off right under your eyes and never say one single word? What did\r\n      that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean? Why,\r\n      she tried to learn you your book, she tried to learn you your manners, she\r\n      tried to be good to you every way she knowed how. <i>That’s</i>\r\n      what she done.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead. I\r\n      fidgeted up and down the raft, abusing myself to myself, and Jim was\r\n      fidgeting up and down past me. We neither of us could keep still.\r\n      Every time he danced around and says, “Dah’s Cairo!”\r\n      it went through me like a shot, and I thought if it <i>was</i> Cairo I\r\n      reckoned I would die of miserableness.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself. He\r\n      was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he\r\n      would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent, and when he got\r\n      enough he would buy his wife, which was owned on a farm close to where\r\n      Miss Watson lived; and then they would both work to buy the two children,\r\n      and if their master wouldn’t sell them, they’d get an Ab’litionist\r\n      to go and steal them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It most froze me to hear such talk. He wouldn’t ever dared to\r\n      talk such talk in his life before. Just see what a difference it\r\n      made in him the minute he judged he was about free. It was according\r\n      to the old saying, “Give a nigger an inch and he’ll take an\r\n      ell.” Thinks I, this is what comes of my not thinking. Here\r\n      was this nigger, which I had as good as helped to run away, coming right\r\n      out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children—children that\r\n      belonged to a man I didn’t even know; a man that hadn’t ever\r\n      done me no harm.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was sorry to hear Jim say that, it was such a lowering of him. My\r\n      conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to\r\n      it, “Let up on me—it ain’t too late yet—I’ll\r\n      paddle ashore at the first light and tell.” I felt easy and\r\n      happy and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone.\r\n      I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to\r\n      myself. By and by one showed. Jim sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We’s safe, Huck, we’s safe! Jump up and crack yo’ \r\n      heels! Dat’s de good ole Cairo at las’, I jis knows it!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll take the canoe and go and see, Jim. It mightn’t\r\n      be, you know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He jumped and got the canoe ready, and put his old coat in the bottom for\r\n      me to set on, and give me the paddle; and as I shoved off, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Pooty soon I’ll be a-shout’n’ for joy, en I’ll\r\n      say, it’s all on accounts o’ Huck; I’s a free man, en I\r\n      couldn’t ever ben free ef it hadn’ ben for Huck; Huck done it.\r\n      Jim won’t ever forgit you, Huck; you’s de bes’ \r\n      fren’ Jim’s ever had; en you’s de <i>only</i> fren’ \r\n      ole Jim’s got now.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was paddling off, all in a sweat to tell on him; but when he says this,\r\n      it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me. I went along slow\r\n      then, and I warn’t right down certain whether I was glad I started\r\n      or whether I warn’t. When I was fifty yards off, Jim says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dah you goes, de ole true Huck; de on’y white genlman dat\r\n      ever kep’ his promise to ole Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I just felt sick. But I says, I <i>got</i> to do it—I\r\n      can’t get <i>out</i> of it. Right then along comes a skiff\r\n      with two men in it with guns, and they stopped and I stopped. One of\r\n      them says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s that yonder?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A piece of a raft,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Do you belong on it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, sir.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Any men on it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Only one, sir.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, there’s five niggers run off to-night up yonder, above\r\n      the head of the bend. Is your man white or black?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t answer up prompt. I tried to, but the words wouldn’t\r\n      come. I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it, but I warn’t\r\n      man enough—hadn’t the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was\r\n      weakening; so I just give up trying, and up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He’s white.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon we’ll go and see for ourselves.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I wish you would,” says I, “because it’s pap that’s\r\n      there, and maybe you’d help me tow the raft ashore where the light\r\n      is. He’s sick—and so is mam and Mary Ann.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, the devil! we’re in a hurry, boy. But I s’pose\r\n      we’ve got to. Come, buckle to your paddle, and let’s get\r\n      along.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars. When we had made\r\n      a stroke or two, I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Pap’ll be mighty much obleeged to you, I can tell you. Everybody\r\n      goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore, and I can’t\r\n      do it by myself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, that’s infernal mean. Odd, too. Say, boy,\r\n      what’s the matter with your father?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s the—a—the—well, it ain’t\r\n      anything much.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They stopped pulling. It warn’t but a mighty little ways to\r\n      the raft now. One says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Boy, that’s a lie. What <i>is</i> the matter with your\r\n      pap? Answer up square now, and it’ll be the better for you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c16-126\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c16-126.jpg (74K)\" src=\"images/c16-126.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-172691536969334652\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I will, sir, I will, honest—but don’t leave us, please.\r\n      It’s the—the—Gentlemen, if you’ll only pull\r\n      ahead, and let me heave you the headline, you won’t have to come\r\n      a-near the raft—please do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Set her back, John, set her back!” says one. They\r\n      backed water. “Keep away, boy—keep to looard. Confound\r\n      it, I just expect the wind has blowed it to us. Your pap’s got\r\n      the small-pox, and you know it precious well. Why didn’t you\r\n      come out and say so? Do you want to spread it all over?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” says I, a-blubbering, “I’ve told everybody\r\n      before, and they just went away and left us.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Poor devil, there’s something in that. We are right\r\n      down sorry for you, but we—well, hang it, we don’t want the\r\n      small-pox, you see. Look here, I’ll tell you what to do.\r\n      Don’t you try to land by yourself, or you’ll smash\r\n      everything to pieces. You float along down about twenty miles, and\r\n      you’ll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river. It\r\n      will be long after sun-up then, and when you ask for help you tell them\r\n      your folks are all down with chills and fever. Don’t be a fool\r\n      again, and let people guess what is the matter. Now we’re\r\n      trying to do you a kindness; so you just put twenty miles between us, that’s\r\n      a good boy. It wouldn’t do any good to land yonder where the\r\n      light is—it’s only a wood-yard. Say, I reckon your father’s\r\n      poor, and I’m bound to say he’s in pretty hard luck. Here,\r\n      I’ll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board, and you get it\r\n      when it floats by. I feel mighty mean to leave you; but my kingdom!\r\n      it won’t do to fool with small-pox, don’t you see?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on, Parker,” says the other man, “here’s a\r\n      twenty to put on the board for me. Good-bye, boy; you do as Mr.\r\n      Parker told you, and you’ll be all right.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That’s so, my boy—good-bye, good-bye. If you see\r\n      any runaway niggers you get help and nab them, and you can make some money\r\n      by it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good-bye, sir,” says I; “I won’t let no runaway\r\n      niggers get by me if I can help it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They went off and I got aboard the raft, feeling bad and low, because I\r\n      knowed very well I had done wrong, and I see it warn’t no use for me\r\n      to try to learn to do right; a body that don’t get <i>started</i>\r\n      right when he’s little ain’t got no show—when the pinch\r\n      comes there ain’t nothing to back him up and keep him to his work,\r\n      and so he gets beat. Then I thought a minute, and says to myself,\r\n      hold on; s’pose you’d a done right and give Jim up, would you\r\n      felt better than what you do now? No, says I, I’d feel bad—I’d\r\n      feel just the same way I do now. Well, then, says I, what’s\r\n      the use you learning to do right when it’s troublesome to do right\r\n      and ain’t no trouble to do wrong, and the wages is just the same?\r\n      I was stuck. I couldn’t answer that. So I reckoned\r\n      I wouldn’t bother no more about it, but after this always do\r\n      whichever come handiest at the time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went into the wigwam; Jim warn’t there. I looked all around;\r\n      he warn’t anywhere. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jim!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here I is, Huck. Is dey out o’ sight yit? Don’t\r\n      talk loud.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c16-127\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c16-127.jpg (83K)\" src=\"images/c16-127.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4415306298176817373\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was in the river under the stern oar, with just his nose out. I\r\n      told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I was a-listenin’ to all de talk, en I slips into de river en\r\n      was gwyne to shove for sho’ if dey come aboard. Den I was\r\n      gwyne to swim to de raf’ agin when dey was gone. But lawsy,\r\n      how you did fool ’em, Huck! Dat <i>wuz</i> de smartes’ \r\n      dodge! I tell you, chile, I’spec it save’ ole Jim—ole\r\n      Jim ain’t going to forgit you for dat, honey.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then we talked about the money. It was a pretty good raise—twenty\r\n      dollars apiece. Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat\r\n      now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free\r\n      States. He said twenty mile more warn’t far for the raft to go, but\r\n      he wished we was already there.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Towards daybreak we tied up, and Jim was mighty particular about hiding\r\n      the raft good. Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles, and\r\n      getting all ready to quit rafting.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in\r\n      a left-hand bend.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went off in the canoe to ask about it. Pretty soon I found a man\r\n      out in the river with a skiff, setting a trot-line. I ranged up and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mister, is that town Cairo?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cairo? no. You must be a blame’ fool.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What town is it, mister?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If you want to know, go and find out. If you stay here\r\n      botherin’ around me for about a half a minute longer you’ll\r\n      get something you won’t want.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I paddled to the raft. Jim was awful disappointed, but I said never\r\n      mind, Cairo would be the next place, I reckoned.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We passed another town before daylight, and I was going out again; but it\r\n      was high ground, so I didn’t go. No high ground about Cairo,\r\n      Jim said. I had forgot it. We laid up for the day on a towhead\r\n      tolerable close to the left-hand bank. I begun to suspicion\r\n      something. So did Jim. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Doan’ le’s talk about it, Huck. Po’ niggers\r\n      can’t have no luck. I awluz ’spected dat\r\n      rattlesnake-skin warn’t done wid its work.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I wish I’d never seen that snake-skin, Jim—I do wish I’d\r\n      never laid eyes on it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t yo’ fault, Huck; you didn’ know. Don’t\r\n      you blame yo’self ’bout it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure enough,\r\n      and outside was the old regular Muddy! So it was all up with Cairo.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We talked it all over. It wouldn’t do to take to the shore; we\r\n      couldn’t take the raft up the stream, of course. There warn’t\r\n      no way but to wait for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the\r\n      chances. So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket, so as\r\n      to be fresh for the work, and when we went back to the raft about dark the\r\n      canoe was gone!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We didn’t say a word for a good while. There warn’t\r\n      anything to say. We both knowed well enough it was some more work of\r\n      the rattlesnake-skin; so what was the use to talk about it? It would\r\n      only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more\r\n      bad luck—and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep\r\n      still.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn’t\r\n      no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy\r\n      a canoe to go back in. We warn’t going to borrow it when there\r\n      warn’t anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set\r\n      people after us.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we shoved out after dark on the raft.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Anybody that don’t believe yet that it’s foolishness to handle\r\n      a snake-skin, after all that that snake-skin done for us, will believe it\r\n      now if they read on and see what more it done for us.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore. But we\r\n      didn’t see no rafts laying up; so we went along during three hours\r\n      and more. Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the\r\n      next meanest thing to fog. You can’t tell the shape of the\r\n      river, and you can’t see no distance. It got to be very late and\r\n      still, and then along comes a steamboat up the river. We lit the\r\n      lantern, and judged she would see it. Up-stream boats didn’t\r\n      generly come close to us; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for\r\n      easy water under the reefs; but nights like this they bull right up the\r\n      channel against the whole river.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We could hear her pounding along, but we didn’t see her good till\r\n      she was close. She aimed right for us. Often they do that and\r\n      try to see how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel\r\n      bites off a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and\r\n      thinks he’s mighty smart. Well, here she comes, and we said\r\n      she was going to try and shave us; but she didn’t seem to be\r\n      sheering off a bit. She was a big one, and she was coming in a\r\n      hurry, too, looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it;\r\n      but all of a sudden she bulged out, big and scary, with a long row of\r\n      wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows\r\n      and guards hanging right over us. There was a yell at us, and a\r\n      jingling of bells to stop the engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling\r\n      of steam—and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other,\r\n      she come smashing straight through the raft.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I dived—and I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\r\n      had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room. I\r\n      could always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under\r\n      a minute and a half. Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I\r\n      was nearly busting. I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water\r\n      out of my nose, and puffed a bit. Of course there was a booming\r\n      current; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds\r\n      after she stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she\r\n      was churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though\r\n      I could hear her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn’t get any answer;\r\n      so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was “treading water,”\r\n      and struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me. But I made out to\r\n      see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\r\n      meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\r\n      long time in getting over. I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\r\n      bank. I couldn’t see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\r\n      rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a big\r\n      old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it. I was going to\r\n      rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and\r\n      barking at me, and I knowed better than to move another peg.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c16-131\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c16-131.jpg (55K)\" src=\"images/c16-131.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7591320346460771784\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c17-132\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c17\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-132.jpg (139K)\" src=\"images/c17-132.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6538490926877978185\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head\r\n      out, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Be done, boys! Who’s there?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who’s me?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “George Jackson, sir.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do you want?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t want nothing, sir.

Strike a light there, somebody. What\r\n      did you say your name was?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “George Jackson, sir. I’m only a boy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Look here, if you’re telling the truth you needn’t be\r\n      afraid—nobody’ll hurt you. But don’t try to budge;\r\n      stand right where you are. Rouse out Bob and Tom, some of you, and\r\n      fetch the guns. George Jackson, is there anybody with you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sir, nobody.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light. The\r\n      man sung out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Snatch that light away, Betsy, you old fool—ain’t you\r\n      got any sense? Put it on the floor behind the front door.

Now, all ready.\r\n      Step forward, George Jackson. And mind, don’t you hurry—come\r\n      mighty slow. If there’s anybody with you, let him keep back—if\r\n      he shows himself he’ll be shot. Come along now. Come slow;\r\n      push the door open yourself—just enough to squeeze in, d’ you\r\n      hear?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t hurry; I couldn’t if I’d a wanted to. I\r\n      took one slow step at a time and there warn’t a sound, only I\r\n      thought I could hear my heart. The dogs were as still as the humans,\r\n      but they followed a little behind me. When I got to the three log\r\n      doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting. I put\r\n      my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody\r\n      said, “There, that’s enough—put your head in.” I\r\n      done it, but I judged they would take it off.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The candle was on the floor, and there they all was, looking at me, and me\r\n      at them, for about a quarter of a minute: Three big men with guns\r\n      pointed at me, which made me wince, I tell you; the oldest, gray and about\r\n      sixty, the other two thirty or more—all of them fine and handsome—and\r\n      the sweetest old gray-headed lady, and back of her two young women which I\r\n      couldn’t see right well. The old gentleman says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “There; I reckon it’s all right. Come in.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and\r\n      bolted it, and told the young men to come in with their guns, and they all\r\n      went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor, and got\r\n      together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows—there\r\n      warn’t none on the side. They held the candle, and took a good\r\n      look at me, and all said, “Why, <i>he</i> ain’t a Shepherdson—no,\r\n      there ain’t any Shepherdson about him.” Then the old man\r\n      said he hoped I wouldn’t mind being searched for arms, because he\r\n      didn’t mean no harm by it—it was only to make sure. So\r\n      he didn’t pry into my pockets, but only felt outside with his hands,\r\n      and said it was all right. He told me to make myself easy and at\r\n      home, and tell all about myself; but the old lady says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, bless you, Saul, the poor thing’s as wet as he can be;\r\n      and don’t you reckon it may be he’s hungry?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “True for you, Rachel—I forgot.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the old lady says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Betsy” (this was a nigger woman), “you fly around and\r\n      get him something to eat as quick as you can, poor thing; and one of you\r\n      girls go and wake up Buck and tell him—oh, here he is himself.\r\n      Buck, take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him\r\n      and dress him up in some of yours that’s dry.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Buck looked about as old as me—thirteen or fourteen or along there,\r\n      though he was a little bigger than me. He hadn’t on anything\r\n      but a shirt, and he was very frowzy-headed. He came in gaping and\r\n      digging one fist into his eyes, and he was dragging a gun along with the\r\n      other one. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c17-134\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-134.jpg (51K)\" src=\"images/c17-134.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2754531472488384587\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ain’t they no Shepherdsons around?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They said, no, ’twas a false alarm.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” he says, “if they’d a ben some, I reckon I’d\r\n      a got one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They all laughed, and Bob says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Buck, they might have scalped us all, you’ve been so\r\n      slow in coming.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, nobody come after me, and it ain’t right I’m\r\n      always kept down; I don’t get no show.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Never mind, Buck, my boy,” says the old man, “you’ll\r\n      have show enough, all in good time, don’t you fret about that.\r\n      Go ’long with you now, and do as your mother told you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a\r\n      roundabout and pants of his, and I put them on. While I was at it he\r\n      asked me what my name was, but before I could tell him he started to tell\r\n      me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day\r\n      before yesterday, and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went\r\n      out. I said I didn’t know; I hadn’t heard about it\r\n      before, no way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, guess,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How’m I going to guess,” says I, “when I never\r\n      heard tell of it before?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But you can guess, can’t you? It’s just as easy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Which</i> candle?” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, any candle,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know where he was,” says I; “where was\r\n      he?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, he was in the <i>dark</i>! That’s where he was!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, if you knowed where he was, what did you ask me for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, blame it, it’s a riddle, don’t you see? Say,\r\n      how long are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We\r\n      can just have booming times—they don’t have no school now.\r\n      Do you own a dog? I’ve got a dog—and he’ll\r\n      go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like\r\n      to comb up Sundays, and all that kind of foolishness? You bet I don’t,\r\n      but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches! I reckon I’d\r\n      better put ’em on, but I’d ruther not, it’s so warm.\r\n      Are you all ready? All right. Come along, old hoss.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Cold corn-pone, cold corn-beef, butter and buttermilk—that is what\r\n      they had for me down there, and there ain’t nothing better that ever\r\n      I’ve come across yet. Buck and his ma and all of them smoked\r\n      cob pipes, except the nigger woman, which was gone, and the two young\r\n      women. They all smoked and talked, and I eat and talked. The\r\n      young women had quilts around them, and their hair down their backs.\r\n      They all asked me questions, and I told them how pap and me and all\r\n      the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw, and\r\n      my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more,\r\n      and Bill went to hunt them and he warn’t heard of no more, and Tom\r\n      and Mort died, and then there warn’t nobody but just me and pap\r\n      left, and he was just trimmed down to nothing, on account of his troubles;\r\n      so when he died I took what there was left, because the farm didn’t\r\n      belong to us, and started up the river, deck passage, and fell overboard;\r\n      and that was how I come to be here. So they said I could have a home\r\n      there as long as I wanted it. Then it was most daylight and\r\n      everybody went to bed, and I went to bed with Buck, and when I waked up in\r\n      the morning, drat it all, I had forgot what my name was. So I laid there\r\n      about an hour trying to think, and when Buck waked up I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Can you spell, Buck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I bet you can’t spell my name,” says I.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I bet you what you dare I can,” says he.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right,” says I, “go ahead.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n—there now,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” says I, “you done it, but I didn’t think\r\n      you could. It ain’t no slouch of a name to spell—right\r\n      off without studying.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I set it down, private, because somebody might want <i>me</i> to spell it\r\n      next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was\r\n      used to it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was a mighty nice family, and a mighty nice house, too. I hadn’t\r\n      seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much\r\n      style. It didn’t have an iron latch on the front door, nor a\r\n      wooden one with a buckskin string, but a brass knob to turn, the same as\r\n      houses in town. There warn’t no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a\r\n      bed; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them. There was a big\r\n      fireplace that was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean\r\n      and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick;\r\n      sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call\r\n      Spanish-brown, same as they do in town. They had big brass dog-irons\r\n      that could hold up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the\r\n      mantelpiece, with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the\r\n      glass front, and a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you\r\n      could see the pendulum swinging behind it. It was beautiful to hear\r\n      that clock tick; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along\r\n      and scoured her up and got her in good shape, she would start in and\r\n      strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out. They wouldn’t\r\n      took any money for her.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock, made\r\n      out of something like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the\r\n      parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and\r\n      when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn’t open their\r\n      mouths nor look different nor interested. They squeaked through\r\n      underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread\r\n      out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was\r\n      a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches\r\n      and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\r\n      than real ones is, but they warn’t real because you could see where\r\n      pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was,\r\n      underneath.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth, with a red and blue\r\n      spread-eagle painted on it, and a painted border all around. It come\r\n      all the way from Philadelphia, they said. There was some books, too,\r\n      piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table. One was a big\r\n      family Bible full of pictures. One was Pilgrim’s Progress,\r\n      about a man that left his family, it didn’t say why. I read\r\n      considerable in it now and then. The statements was interesting, but\r\n      tough. Another was Friendship’s Offering, full of beautiful\r\n      stuff and poetry; but I didn’t read the poetry. Another was\r\n      Henry Clay’s Speeches, and another was Dr. Gunn’s Family\r\n      Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead.\r\n      There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books. And there was\r\n      nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, too—not bagged down\r\n      in the middle and busted, like an old basket.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They had pictures hung on the walls—mainly Washingtons and\r\n      Lafayettes, and battles, and Highland Marys, and one called “Signing\r\n      the Declaration.” There was some that they called crayons, which one\r\n      of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\r\n      fifteen years old. They was different from any pictures I ever see\r\n      before—blacker, mostly, than is common. One was a woman in a\r\n      slim black dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a\r\n      cabbage in the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel\r\n      bonnet with a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black\r\n      tape, and very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning\r\n      pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her\r\n      other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\r\n      and underneath the picture it said “Shall I Never See Thee More\r\n      Alas.” Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed\r\n      up straight to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb\r\n      like a chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead\r\n      bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and\r\n      underneath the picture it said “I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup\r\n      More Alas.” There was one where a young lady was at a window\r\n      looking up at the moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an\r\n      open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it,\r\n      and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth, and\r\n      underneath the picture it said “And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone\r\n      Alas.” These was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn’t\r\n      somehow seem to take to them, because if ever I was down a little they\r\n      always give me the fan-tods. Everybody was sorry she died, because\r\n      she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do, and a body could see\r\n      by what she had done what they had lost. But I reckoned that with\r\n      her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard. She\r\n      was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick,\r\n      and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till\r\n      she got it done, but she never got the chance. It was a picture of a\r\n      young woman in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all\r\n      ready to jump off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the\r\n      moon, with the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded\r\n      across her breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more\r\n      reaching up towards the moon—and the idea was to see which pair\r\n      would look best, and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was\r\n      saying, she died before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this\r\n      picture over the head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday\r\n      come they hung flowers on it. Other times it was hid with a little\r\n      curtain. The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet\r\n      face, but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to\r\n      me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c17-138\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-138.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c17-138.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8879343695497039888\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-139.jpg (72K)\" src=\"images/c17-139.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5224903264265717636\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c17-140\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-140.jpg (104K)\" src=\"images/c17-140.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3687637122586701912\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\r\n      obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\r\n      Presbyterian Observer, and write poetry after them out of her own head. It\r\n      was very good poetry. This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of\r\n      Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS, DEC’D\r\n    </p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n        And did young Stephen sicken,<br>  And did young Stephen\r\n        die?<br> And did the sad hearts thicken,<br>  And did the\r\n        mourners cry?<br> <br> No; such was not the fate of<br>  Young\r\n        Stephen Dowling Bots;<br> Though sad hearts round him thickened,<br>\r\n         ’Twas not from sickness’ shots.<br> <br> No\r\n        whooping-cough did rack his frame,<br>  Nor measles drear\r\n        with spots;<br> Not these impaired the sacred name<br>  Of\r\n        Stephen Dowling Bots.<br> <br> Despised love struck not with woe<br>\r\n         That head of curly knots,<br> Nor stomach troubles laid\r\n        him low,<br>  Young Stephen Dowling Bots.<br> <br> O no.\r\n        Then list with tearful eye,<br>  Whilst I his fate do tell.<br>\r\n        His soul did from this cold world fly<br>  By falling down\r\n        a well.<br> <br> They got him out and emptied him;<br>  Alas\r\n        it was too late;<br> His spirit was gone for to sport aloft<br> \r\n        In the realms of the good and great.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was\r\n      fourteen, there ain’t no telling what she could a done by and by.\r\n      Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing. She didn’t\r\n      ever have to stop to think. He said she would slap down a line, and\r\n      if she couldn’t find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it\r\n      out and slap down another one, and go ahead. She warn’t particular;\r\n      she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just\r\n      so it was sadful. Every time a man died, or a woman died, or a child died,\r\n      she would be on hand with her “tribute” before he was cold.\r\n      She called them tributes. The neighbors said it was the doctor\r\n      first, then Emmeline, then the undertaker—the undertaker never got\r\n      in ahead of Emmeline but once, and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the\r\n      dead person’s name, which was Whistler. She warn’t ever\r\n      the same after that; she never complained, but she kinder pined away and\r\n      did not live long. Poor thing, many’s the time I made myself\r\n      go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old\r\n      scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I\r\n      had soured on her a little. I liked all that family, dead ones and\r\n      all, and warn’t going to let anything come between us. Poor\r\n      Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive, and it\r\n      didn’t seem right that there warn’t nobody to make some about\r\n      her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I\r\n      couldn’t seem to make it go somehow. They kept Emmeline’s\r\n      room trim and nice, and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked\r\n      to have them when she was alive, and nobody ever slept there. The\r\n      old lady took care of the room herself, though there was plenty of\r\n      niggers, and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, as I was saying about the parlor, there was beautiful curtains on\r\n      the windows: white, with pictures painted on them of castles with\r\n      vines all down the walls, and cattle coming down to drink. There was\r\n      a little old piano, too, that had tin pans in it, I reckon, and nothing\r\n      was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing “The Last Link\r\n      is Broken” and play “The Battle of Prague” on it. The\r\n      walls of all the rooms was plastered, and most had carpets on the floors,\r\n      and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was a double house, and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and\r\n      floored, and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day,\r\n      and it was a cool, comfortable place. Nothing couldn’t be\r\n      better. And warn’t the cooking good, and just bushels of it\r\n      too!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c17-142\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c17-142.jpg (48K)\" src=\"images/c17-142.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1971026008876495015\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c18-143\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c18\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c18-143.jpg (161K)\" src=\"images/c18-143.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1847605032449876208\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman\r\n      all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is,\r\n      and that’s worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow\r\n      Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy\r\n      in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn’t no\r\n      more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very\r\n      tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red\r\n      in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face,\r\n      and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils,\r\n      and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk\r\n      so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you,\r\n      as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and\r\n      straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every\r\n      day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot\r\n      made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays\r\n      he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a\r\n      mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn’t no\r\n      frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn’t ever loud. He\r\n      was as kind as he could be—you could feel that, you know, and so you\r\n      had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but\r\n      when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning\r\n      begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree\r\n      first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn’t\r\n      ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners—everybody was always\r\n      good-mannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too;\r\n      he was sunshine most always—I mean he made it seem like good\r\n      weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half\r\n      a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn’t nothing go wrong again\r\n      for a week.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up\r\n      out of their chairs and give them good-day, and didn’t set down\r\n      again till they had set down. Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard\r\n      where the decanter was, and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him,\r\n      and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom’s and Bob’s was\r\n      mixed, and then they bowed and said, “Our duty to you, sir, and\r\n      madam;” and <i>they</i> bowed the least bit in the world and said\r\n      thank you, and so they drank, all three, and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful\r\n      of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom\r\n      of their tumblers, and give it to me and Buck, and we drank to the old\r\n      people too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Bob was the oldest and Tom next—tall, beautiful men with very broad\r\n      shoulders and brown faces, and long black hair and black eyes. They\r\n      dressed in white linen from head to foot, like the old gentleman, and wore\r\n      broad Panama hats.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then there was Miss Charlotte; she was twenty-five, and tall and proud and\r\n      grand, but as good as she could be when she warn’t stirred up; but\r\n      when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks, like\r\n      her father. She was beautiful.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So was her sister, Miss Sophia, but it was a different kind. She was\r\n      gentle and sweet like a dove, and she was only twenty.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Each person had their own nigger to wait on them—Buck too. My\r\n      nigger had a monstrous easy time, because I warn’t used to having\r\n      anybody do anything for me, but Buck’s was on the jump most of the\r\n      time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This was all there was of the family now, but there used to be more—three\r\n      sons; they got killed; and Emmeline that died.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers.\r\n      Sometimes a stack of people would come there, horseback, from ten or\r\n      fifteen mile around, and stay five or six days, and have such junketings\r\n      round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\r\n      daytimes, and balls at the house nights. These people was mostly\r\n      kinfolks of the family. The men brought their guns with them. It\r\n      was a handsome lot of quality, I tell you.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was another clan of aristocracy around there—five or six\r\n      families—mostly of the name of Shepherdson. They was as\r\n      high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords.\r\n      The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing,\r\n      which was about two mile above our house; so sometimes when I went up\r\n      there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons\r\n      there on their fine horses.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting, and heard a horse\r\n      coming. We was crossing the road. Buck says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Quick! Jump for the woods!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c18-145\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c18-145.jpg (70K)\" src=\"images/c18-145.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-999430798914667736\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We done it, and then peeped down the woods through the leaves. Pretty\r\n      soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road, setting his horse\r\n      easy and looking like a soldier. He had his gun across his pommel.\r\n      I had seen him before. It was young Harney Shepherdson. I\r\n      heard Buck’s gun go off at my ear, and Harney’s hat tumbled\r\n      off from his head. He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place\r\n      where we was hid. But we didn’t wait. We started through\r\n      the woods on a run. The woods warn’t thick, so I looked over\r\n      my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with\r\n      his gun; and then he rode away the way he come—to get his hat, I\r\n      reckon, but I couldn’t see. We never stopped running till we\r\n      got home. The old gentleman’s eyes blazed a minute—’twas\r\n      pleasure, mainly, I judged—then his face sort of smoothed down, and\r\n      he says, kind of gentle:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t like that shooting from behind a bush. Why didn’t\r\n      you step into the road, my boy?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The Shepherdsons don’t, father. They always take\r\n      advantage.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling\r\n      his tale, and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped. The two\r\n      young men looked dark, but never said nothing. Miss Sophia she\r\n      turned pale, but the color come back when she found the man warn’t\r\n      hurt.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c18-146\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c18-146.jpg (44K)\" src=\"images/c18-146.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7637106186850758471\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by\r\n      ourselves, I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did you want to kill him, Buck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I bet I did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did he do to you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Him? He never done nothing to me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s a feud?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, where was you raised? Don’t you know what a feud\r\n      is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Never heard of it before—tell me about it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” says Buck, “a feud is this way: A man has\r\n      a quarrel with another man, and kills him; then that other man’s\r\n      brother kills <i>him</i>; then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for\r\n      one another; then the <i>cousins</i> chip in—and by and by everybody’s\r\n      killed off, and there ain’t no more feud. But it’s kind\r\n      of slow, and takes a long time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Has this one been going on long, Buck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I should <i>reckon</i>! It started thirty year ago, or\r\n      som’ers along there. There was trouble ’bout something,\r\n      and then a lawsuit to settle it; and the suit went agin one of the men,\r\n      and so he up and shot the man that won the suit—which he would\r\n      naturally do, of course. Anybody would.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What was the trouble about, Buck?—land?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon maybe—I don’t know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, who done the shooting? Was it a Grangerford or a\r\n      Shepherdson?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Laws, how do I know? It was so long ago.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t anybody know?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes, pa knows, I reckon, and some of the other old people; but\r\n      they don’t know now what the row was about in the first place.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Has there been many killed, Buck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes; right smart chance of funerals. But they don’t\r\n      always kill. Pa’s got a few buckshot in him; but he don’t\r\n      mind it ’cuz he don’t weigh much, anyway. Bob’s\r\n      been carved up some with a bowie, and Tom’s been hurt once or twice.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Has anybody been killed this year, Buck?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes; we got one and they got one. ’Bout three months\r\n      ago my cousin Bud, fourteen year old, was riding through the woods on t’other\r\n      side of the river, and didn’t have no weapon with him, which was\r\n      blame’ foolishness, and in a lonesome place he hears a horse\r\n      a-coming behind him, and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin’ after\r\n      him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind; and\r\n      ’stead of jumping off and taking to the brush, Bud ’lowed he\r\n      could out-run him; so they had it, nip and tuck, for five mile or more,\r\n      the old man a-gaining all the time; so at last Bud seen it warn’t\r\n      any use, so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in\r\n      front, you know, and the old man he rode up and shot him down. But\r\n      he didn’t git much chance to enjoy his luck, for inside of a week\r\n      our folks laid <i>him</i> out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon that old man was a coward, Buck.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon he <i>warn’t</i> a coward. Not by a blame’ \r\n      sight. There ain’t a coward amongst them Shepherdsons—not\r\n      a one. And there ain’t no cowards amongst the Grangerfords\r\n      either. Why, that old man kep’ up his end in a fight one day\r\n      for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come out winner. They\r\n      was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little\r\n      woodpile, and kep’ his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the\r\n      Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and\r\n      peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his\r\n      horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had\r\n      to be <i>fetched</i> home—and one of ’em was dead, and another\r\n      died the next day. No, sir; if a body’s out hunting for\r\n      cowards he don’t want to fool away any time amongst them\r\n      Shepherdsons, becuz they don’t breed any of that <i>kind</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\r\n      a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept them\r\n      between their knees or stood them handy against the wall. The\r\n      Shepherdsons done the same. It was pretty ornery preaching—all\r\n      about brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it\r\n      was a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such a\r\n      powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\r\n      preforeordestination, and I don’t know what all, that it did seem to\r\n      me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their\r\n      chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck\r\n      and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I\r\n      went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found\r\n      that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and\r\n      she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I\r\n      liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for\r\n      her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she’d\r\n      forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other\r\n      books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and\r\n      not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped\r\n      off up the road, and there warn’t anybody at the church, except\r\n      maybe a hog or two, for there warn’t any lock on the door, and hogs\r\n      likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it’s cool. If\r\n      you notice, most folks don’t go to church only when they’ve\r\n      got to; but a hog is different.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c18-149\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c18-149.jpg (54K)\" src=\"images/c18-149.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3158525078424962393\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says I to myself, something’s up; it ain’t natural for a girl\r\n      to be in such a sweat about a Testament. So I give it a shake, and\r\n      out drops a little piece of paper with “HALF-PAST TWO” wrote\r\n      on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn’t find\r\n      anything else. I couldn’t make anything out of that, so I put\r\n      the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was\r\n      Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut\r\n      the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and\r\n      as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she\r\n      grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the\r\n      world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a\r\n      minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I\r\n      was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the\r\n      paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she\r\n      asked me if I could read writing, and I told her “no, only\r\n      coarse-hand,” and then she said the paper warn’t anything but\r\n      a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon I\r\n      noticed that my nigger was following along behind. When we was out\r\n      of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\r\n      a-running, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mars Jawge, if you’ll come down into de swamp I’ll show\r\n      you a whole stack o’ water-moccasins.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Thinks I, that’s mighty curious; he said that yesterday. He\r\n      oughter know a body don’t love water-moccasins enough to go around\r\n      hunting for them. What is he up to, anyway? So I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right; trot ahead.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\r\n      ankle deep as much as another half-mile. We come to a little flat\r\n      piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and\r\n      vines, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You shove right in dah jist a few steps, Mars Jawge; dah’s\r\n      whah dey is. I’s seed ’m befo’; I don’t k’yer\r\n      to see ’em no mo’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he slopped right along and went away, and pretty soon the trees hid\r\n      him. I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch\r\n      as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines, and found a man laying\r\n      there asleep—and, by jings, it was my old Jim!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I waked him up, and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him\r\n      to see me again, but it warn’t. He nearly cried he was so\r\n      glad, but he warn’t surprised. Said he swum along behind me\r\n      that night, and heard me yell every time, but dasn’t answer, because\r\n      he didn’t want nobody to pick <i>him</i> up and take him into\r\n      slavery again. Says he:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I got hurt a little, en couldn’t swim fas’, so I wuz a\r\n      considable ways behine you towards de las’; when you landed I reck’ned\r\n      I could ketch up wid you on de lan’ ’dout havin’ to\r\n      shout at you, but when I see dat house I begin to go slow. I ’uz\r\n      off too fur to hear what dey say to you—I wuz ’fraid o’ \r\n      de dogs; but when it ’uz all quiet agin I knowed you’s in de\r\n      house, so I struck out for de woods to wait for day. Early in de\r\n      mawnin’ some er de niggers come along, gwyne to de fields, en dey\r\n      tuk me en showed me dis place, whah de dogs can’t track me on\r\n      accounts o’ de water, en dey brings me truck to eat every night, en\r\n      tells me how you’s a-gitt’n along.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why didn’t you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, ’twarn’t no use to ’sturb you, Huck, tell\r\n      we could do sumfn—but we’s all right now. I ben a-buyin’ \r\n      pots en pans en vittles, as I got a chanst, en a-patchin’ up de raf’ \r\n      nights when—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>What</i> raft, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Our ole raf’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You mean to say our old raft warn’t smashed all to flinders?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, she warn’t. She was tore up a good deal—one\r\n      en’ of her was; but dey warn’t no great harm done, on’y\r\n      our traps was mos’ all los’. Ef we hadn’ dive’ \r\n      so deep en swum so fur under water, en de night hadn’ ben so dark,\r\n      en we warn’t so sk’yerd, en ben sich punkin-heads, as de sayin’ \r\n      is, we’d a seed de raf’. But it’s jis’ as\r\n      well we didn’t, ’kase now she’s all fixed up agin mos’ \r\n      as good as new, en we’s got a new lot o’ stuff, in de place o’ \r\n      what ’uz los’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, how did you get hold of the raft again, Jim—did you\r\n      catch her?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods? No; some er de\r\n      niggers foun’ her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben’, en\r\n      dey hid her in a crick ’mongst de willows, en dey wuz so much jawin’ \r\n      ’bout which un ’um she b’long to de mos’ dat I\r\n      come to heah ’bout it pooty soon, so I ups en settles de trouble by\r\n      tellin’ ’um she don’t b’long to none uv um, but to\r\n      you en me; en I ast ’m if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman’s\r\n      propaty, en git a hid’n for it? Den I gin ’m ten cents\r\n      apiece, en dey ’uz mighty well satisfied, en wisht some mo’ \r\n      raf’s ’ud come along en make ’m rich agin. Dey’s\r\n      mighty good to me, dese niggers is, en whatever I wants ’m to do fur\r\n      me I doan’ have to ast ’m twice, honey. Dat Jack’s\r\n      a good nigger, en pooty smart.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, he is. He ain’t ever told me you was here; told me\r\n      to come, and he’d show me a lot of water-moccasins. If\r\n      anything happens <i>he</i> ain’t mixed up in it. He can say he\r\n      never seen us together, and it ’ll be the truth.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I don’t want to talk much about the next day. I reckon I’ll\r\n      cut it pretty short. I waked up about dawn, and was a-going to turn\r\n      over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was—didn’t\r\n      seem to be anybody stirring. That warn’t usual. Next I\r\n      noticed that Buck was up and gone. Well, I gets up, a-wondering, and goes\r\n      down stairs—nobody around; everything as still as a mouse. Just\r\n      the same outside. Thinks I, what does it mean? Down by the\r\n      wood-pile I comes across my Jack, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s it all about?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says he:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you know, Mars Jawge?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” says I, “I don’t.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, den, Miss Sophia’s run off! ’deed she has. She\r\n      run off in de night some time—nobody don’t know jis’ \r\n      when; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson, you know—leastways,\r\n      so dey ’spec. De fambly foun’ it out ’bout half an\r\n      hour ago—maybe a little mo’—en’ I <i>tell</i> you\r\n      dey warn’t no time los’. Sich another hurryin’ up\r\n      guns en hosses <i>you</i> never see! De women folks has gone for to\r\n      stir up de relations, en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up\r\n      de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ’fo’ \r\n      he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia. I reck’n dey’s\r\n      gwyne to be mighty rough times.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Buck went off ’thout waking me up.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I reck’n he <i>did</i>! Dey warn’t gwyne to\r\n      mix you up in it. Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ’lowed he’s\r\n      gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust. Well, dey’ll be plenty un\r\n      ’m dah, I reck’n, en you bet you he’ll fetch one ef he\r\n      gits a chanst.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took up the river road as hard as I could put. By and by I begin\r\n      to hear guns a good ways off. When I come in sight of the log store\r\n      and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees\r\n      and brush till I got to a good place, and then I clumb up into the forks\r\n      of a cottonwood that was out of reach, and watched. There was a\r\n      wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree, and first I\r\n      was going to hide behind that; but maybe it was luckier I didn’t.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open\r\n      place before the log store, cussing and yelling, and trying to get at a\r\n      couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the\r\n      steamboat landing; but they couldn’t come it. Every time one\r\n      of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at.\r\n      The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile, so they\r\n      could watch both ways.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c18-153\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c18-153.jpg (73K)\" src=\"images/c18-153.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7091367250960615430\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling. They started\r\n      riding towards the store; then up gets one of the boys, draws a steady\r\n      bead over the wood-rank, and drops one of them out of his saddle. All\r\n      the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to\r\n      carry him to the store; and that minute the two boys started on the run.\r\n      They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed. Then\r\n      the men see them, and jumped on their horses and took out after them.\r\n      They gained on the boys, but it didn’t do no good, the boys\r\n      had too good a start; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my\r\n      tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men\r\n      again. One of the boys was Buck, and the other was a slim young chap about\r\n      nineteen years old.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The men ripped around awhile, and then rode away. As soon as they\r\n      was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him. He didn’t\r\n      know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first. He\r\n      was awful surprised. He told me to watch out sharp and let him know\r\n      when the men come in sight again; said they was up to some devilment or\r\n      other—wouldn’t be gone long. I wished I was out of that\r\n      tree, but I dasn’t come down. Buck begun to cry and rip, and\r\n      ’lowed that him and his cousin Joe (that was the other young chap)\r\n      would make up for this day yet. He said his father and his two\r\n      brothers was killed, and two or three of the enemy. Said the\r\n      Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush. Buck said his father and\r\n      brothers ought to waited for their relations—the Shepherdsons was\r\n      too strong for them. I asked him what was become of young Harney and\r\n      Miss Sophia. He said they’d got across the river and was safe.\r\n      I was glad of that; but the way Buck did take on because he didn’t\r\n      manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him—I hain’t ever\r\n      heard anything like it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns—the men\r\n      had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their\r\n      horses! The boys jumped for the river—both of them hurt—and\r\n      as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them\r\n      and singing out, “Kill them, kill them!” It made me so\r\n      sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain’t a-going to tell <i>all</i>\r\n      that happened—it would make me sick again if I was to do that.\r\n      I wished I hadn’t ever come ashore that night to see such\r\n      things. I ain’t ever going to get shut of them—lots of\r\n      times I dream about them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down.\r\n      Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little\r\n      gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the\r\n      trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up\r\n      my mind I wouldn’t ever go anear that house again, because I\r\n      reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant\r\n      that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run\r\n      off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the\r\n      curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this\r\n      awful mess wouldn’t ever happened.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece,\r\n      and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at\r\n      them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away\r\n      as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck’s\r\n      face, for he was mighty good to me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck\r\n      through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn’t on his\r\n      island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the\r\n      willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The\r\n      raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn’t\r\n      get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not\r\n      twenty-five foot from me says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good lan’! is dat you, honey? Doan’ make no\r\n      noise.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was Jim’s voice—nothing ever sounded so good before. I\r\n      run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and\r\n      hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Laws bless you, chile, I ’uz right down sho’ you’s\r\n      dead agin. Jack’s been heah; he say he reck’n you’s\r\n      ben shot, kase you didn’ come home no mo’; so I’s jes’ \r\n      dis minute a startin’ de raf’ down towards de mouf er de\r\n      crick, so’s to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack\r\n      comes agin en tells me for certain you <i>is</i> dead. Lawsy, I’s\r\n      mighty glad to git you back again, honey.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right—that’s mighty good; they won’t find me,\r\n      and they’ll think I’ve been killed, and floated down the river—there’s\r\n      something up there that ’ll help them think so—so don’t\r\n      you lose no time, Jim, but just shove off for the big water as fast as\r\n      ever you can.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the\r\n      middle of the Mississippi. Then we hung up our signal lantern, and\r\n      judged that we was free and safe once more. I hadn’t had a\r\n      bite to eat since yesterday, so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and\r\n      buttermilk, and pork and cabbage and greens—there ain’t\r\n      nothing in the world so good when it’s cooked right—and whilst\r\n      I eat my supper we talked and had a good time. I was powerful glad\r\n      to get away from the feuds, and so was Jim to get away from the swamp.\r\n      We said there warn’t no home like a raft, after all. Other\r\n      places do seem so cramped up and smothery, but a raft don’t. You\r\n      feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c19-157\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c19\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c19-157.jpg (169K)\" src=\"images/c19-157.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3221615202752816908\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XIX.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Two or three days and nights went by; I reckon I might say they swum by,\r\n      they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely. Here is the way we\r\n      put in the time. It was a monstrous big river down there—sometimes\r\n      a mile and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon\r\n      as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up—nearly\r\n      always in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods\r\n      and willows, and hid the raft with them. Then we set out the lines.\r\n      Next we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and\r\n      cool off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about\r\n      knee deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywheres—perfectly\r\n      still—just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the\r\n      bullfrogs a-cluttering, maybe. The first thing to see, looking away\r\n      over the water, was a kind of dull line—that was the woods on t’other\r\n      side; you couldn’t make nothing else out; then a pale place in the\r\n      sky; then more paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away\r\n      off, and warn’t black any more, but gray; you could see little dark\r\n      spots drifting along ever so far away—trading scows, and such\r\n      things; and long black streaks—rafts; sometimes you could hear a\r\n      sweep screaking; or jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so\r\n      far; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by\r\n      the look of the streak that there’s a snag there in a swift current\r\n      which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way; and you see the\r\n      mist curl up off of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and\r\n      you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t’other\r\n      side of the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so\r\n      you can throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up,\r\n      and comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to\r\n      smell on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\r\n      because they’ve left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and\r\n      they do get pretty rank; and next you’ve got the full day, and\r\n      everything smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      A little smoke couldn’t be noticed now, so we would take some fish\r\n      off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast. And afterwards we\r\n      would watch the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by\r\n      and by lazy off to sleep. Wake up by and by, and look to see what\r\n      done it, and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off\r\n      towards the other side you couldn’t tell nothing about her only\r\n      whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there\r\n      wouldn’t be nothing to hear nor nothing to see—just solid\r\n      lonesomeness. Next you’d see a raft sliding by, away off\r\n      yonder, and maybe a galoot on it chopping, because they’re most\r\n      always doing it on a raft; you’d see the axe flash and come down—you\r\n      don’t hear nothing; you see that axe go up again, and by the time it’s\r\n      above the man’s head then you hear the <i>k’chunk</i>!—it\r\n      had took all that time to come over the water. So we would put in\r\n      the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness. Once there was\r\n      a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so\r\n      the steamboats wouldn’t run over them. A scow or a raft went\r\n      by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing—heard\r\n      them plain; but we couldn’t see no sign of them; it made you feel\r\n      crawly; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air. Jim\r\n      said he believed it was spirits; but I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No; spirits wouldn’t say, ‘Dern the dern fog.’”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\r\n      middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted her\r\n      to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and talked\r\n      about all kinds of things—we was always naked, day and night,\r\n      whenever the mosquitoes would let us—the new clothes Buck’s\r\n      folks made for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn’t\r\n      go much on clothes, nohow.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Sometimes we’d have that whole river all to ourselves for the\r\n      longest time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and\r\n      maybe a spark—which was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on\r\n      the water you could see a spark or two—on a raft or a scow, you\r\n      know; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of\r\n      them crafts. It’s lovely to live on a raft. We had the sky up\r\n      there, all speckled with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look\r\n      up at them, and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.\r\n      Jim he allowed they was made, but I allowed they happened; I judged\r\n      it would have took too long to <i>make</i> so many. Jim said the\r\n      moon could a <i>laid</i> them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I\r\n      didn’t say nothing against it, because I’ve seen a frog lay\r\n      most as many, so of course it could be done. We used to watch the stars\r\n      that fell, too, and see them streak down. Jim allowed they’d\r\n      got spoiled and was hove out of the nest.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\r\n      dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of\r\n      her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\r\n      pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her\r\n      powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her waves\r\n      would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the raft a\r\n      bit, and after that you wouldn’t hear nothing for you couldn’t\r\n      tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or three\r\n      hours the shores was black—no more sparks in the cabin windows.\r\n      These sparks was our clock—the first one that showed again\r\n      meant morning was coming, so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right\r\n      away.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the\r\n      main shore—it was only two hundred yards—and paddled about a\r\n      mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods, to see if I couldn’t get\r\n      some berries. Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath\r\n      crossed the crick, here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight\r\n      as they could foot it. I thought I was a goner, for whenever anybody\r\n      was after anybody I judged it was <i>me</i>—or maybe Jim. I\r\n      was about to dig out from there in a hurry, but they was pretty close to\r\n      me then, and sung out and begged me to save their lives—said they\r\n      hadn’t been doing nothing, and was being chased for it—said\r\n      there was men and dogs a-coming. They wanted to jump right in, but I\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c19-160\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c19-160.jpg (84K)\" src=\"images/c19-160.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2330782618567628077\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you do it. I don’t hear the dogs and horses\r\n      yet; you’ve got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick\r\n      a little ways; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in—that’ll\r\n      throw the dogs off the scent.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They done it, and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead, and\r\n      in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off,\r\n      shouting. We heard them come along towards the crick, but couldn’t\r\n      see them; they seemed to stop and fool around a while; then, as we got\r\n      further and further away all the time, we couldn’t hardly hear them\r\n      at all; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the\r\n      river, everything was quiet, and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in\r\n      the cottonwoods and was safe.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards, and had a bald head and\r\n      very gray whiskers. He had an old battered-up slouch hat on, and a\r\n      greasy blue woollen shirt, and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into\r\n      his boot-tops, and home-knit galluses—no, he only had one. He\r\n      had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over\r\n      his arm, and both of them had big, fat, ratty-looking carpet-bags.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The other fellow was about thirty, and dressed about as ornery. After\r\n      breakfast we all laid off and talked, and the first thing that come out\r\n      was that these chaps didn’t know one another.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What got you into trouble?” says the baldhead to t’other\r\n      chap.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’d been selling an article to take the tartar off the\r\n      teeth—and it does take it off, too, and generly the enamel along\r\n      with it—but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to, and was\r\n      just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this\r\n      side of town, and you told me they were coming, and begged me to help you\r\n      to get off. So I told you I was expecting trouble myself, and would\r\n      scatter out <i>with</i> you. That’s the whole yarn—what’s\r\n      yourn?\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’d ben a-running’ a little temperance revival\r\n      thar ’bout a week, and was the pet of the women folks, big and\r\n      little, for I was makin’ it mighty warm for the rummies, I <i>tell</i>\r\n      you, and takin’ as much as five or six dollars a night—ten\r\n      cents a head, children and niggers free—and business a-growin’ \r\n      all the time, when somehow or another a little report got around last\r\n      night that I had a way of puttin’ in my time with a private jug on\r\n      the sly. A nigger rousted me out this mornin’, and told me the\r\n      people was getherin’ on the quiet with their dogs and horses, and\r\n      they’d be along pretty soon and give me ’bout half an hour’s\r\n      start, and then run me down if they could; and if they got me they’d\r\n      tar and feather me and ride me on a rail, sure. I didn’t wait\r\n      for no breakfast—I warn’t hungry.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Old man,” said the young one, “I reckon we might\r\n      double-team it together; what do you think?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I ain’t undisposed. What’s your line—mainly?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jour printer by trade; do a little in patent medicines;\r\n      theater-actor—tragedy, you know; take a turn to mesmerism and\r\n      phrenology when there’s a chance; teach singing-geography school for\r\n      a change; sling a lecture sometimes—oh, I do lots of things—most\r\n      anything that comes handy, so it ain’t work. What’s your\r\n      lay?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ve done considerble in the doctoring way in my time. Layin’ \r\n      on o’ hands is my best holt—for cancer and paralysis, and sich\r\n      things; and I k’n tell a fortune pretty good when I’ve got\r\n      somebody along to find out the facts for me. Preachin’s my\r\n      line, too, and workin’ camp-meetin’s, and missionaryin’ \r\n      around.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Nobody never said anything for a while; then the young man hove a sigh and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Alas!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What ’re you alassin’ about?” says the bald-head.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “To think I should have lived to be leading such a life, and be\r\n      degraded down into such company.” And he begun to wipe the\r\n      corner of his eye with a rag.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dern your skin, ain’t the company good enough for you?”\r\n      says the baldhead, pretty pert and uppish.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, it <i>is</i> good enough for me; it’s as good as I\r\n      deserve; for who fetched me so low when I was so high? I did myself.\r\n      I don’t blame <i>you</i>, gentlemen—far from it; I don’t\r\n      blame anybody. I deserve it all. Let the cold world do its\r\n      worst; one thing I know—there’s a grave somewhere for me. The\r\n      world may go on just as it’s always done, and take everything from\r\n      me—loved ones, property, everything; but it can’t take that.\r\n      Some day I’ll lie down in it and forget it all, and my poor broken\r\n      heart will be at rest.” He went on a-wiping.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Drot your pore broken heart,” says the baldhead; “what\r\n      are you heaving your pore broken heart at <i>us</i> f’r? <i>we</i>\r\n      hain’t done nothing.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, I know you haven’t. I ain’t blaming you,\r\n      gentlemen. I brought myself down—yes, I did it myself. It’s\r\n      right I should suffer—perfectly right—I don’t make any\r\n      moan.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Brought you down from whar? Whar was you brought down from?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ah, you would not believe me; the world never believes—let it\r\n      pass—’tis no matter. The secret of my birth—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The secret of your birth! Do you mean to say—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gentlemen,” says the young man, very solemn, “I will\r\n      reveal it to you, for I feel I may have confidence in you. By rights\r\n      I am a duke!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c19-163\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c19-163.jpg (52K)\" src=\"images/c19-163.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8650288578434565734\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim’s eyes bugged out when he heard that; and I reckon mine did,\r\n      too. Then the baldhead says: “No! you can’t mean it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes. My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of\r\n      Bridgewater, fled to this country about the end of the last century, to\r\n      breathe the pure air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son,\r\n      his own father dying about the same time. The second son of the late\r\n      duke seized the titles and estates—the infant real duke was ignored.\r\n      I am the lineal descendant of that infant—I am the rightful\r\n      Duke of Bridgewater; and here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate,\r\n      hunted of men, despised by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and\r\n      degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but he\r\n      said it warn’t much use, he couldn’t be much comforted; said\r\n      if we was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\r\n      anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how. He said\r\n      we ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say “Your Grace,” or\r\n      “My Lord,” or “Your Lordship”—and he wouldn’t\r\n      mind it if we called him plain “Bridgewater,” which, he said,\r\n      was a title anyway, and not a name; and one of us ought to wait on him at\r\n      dinner, and do any little thing for him he wanted done.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, that was all easy, so we done it. All through dinner Jim stood\r\n      around and waited on him, and says, “Will yo’ Grace have some\r\n      o’ dis or some o’ dat?” and so on, and a body could see\r\n      it was mighty pleasing to him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But the old man got pretty silent by and by—didn’t have much\r\n      to say, and didn’t look pretty comfortable over all that petting\r\n      that was going on around that duke. He seemed to have something on\r\n      his mind. So, along in the afternoon, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Looky here, Bilgewater,” he says, “I’m nation\r\n      sorry for you, but you ain’t the only person that’s had\r\n      troubles like that.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No you ain’t. You ain’t the only person that’s\r\n      ben snaked down wrongfully out’n a high place.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Alas!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, you ain’t the only person that’s had a secret of\r\n      his birth.” And, by jings, <i>he</i> begins to cry.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold! What do you mean?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Bilgewater, kin I trust you?” says the old man, still sort of\r\n      sobbing.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “To the bitter death!” He took the old man by the hand\r\n      and squeezed it, and says, “That secret of your being: speak!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c19-165\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c19-165.jpg (55K)\" src=\"images/c19-165.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1244287017290237382\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      You bet you, Jim and me stared this time. Then the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You are what?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, my friend, it is too true—your eyes is lookin’ at\r\n      this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son\r\n      of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You! At your age! No! You mean you’re the\r\n      late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very\r\n      least.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has\r\n      brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen,\r\n      you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin’, exiled,\r\n      trampled-on, and sufferin’ rightful King of France.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn’t know hardly\r\n      what to do, we was so sorry—and so glad and proud we’d got him\r\n      with us, too. So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and\r\n      tried to comfort <i>him</i>. But he said it warn’t no use, nothing\r\n      but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good; though he said\r\n      it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him\r\n      according to his rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and\r\n      always called him “Your Majesty,” and waited on him first at\r\n      meals, and didn’t set down in his presence till he asked them. So\r\n      Jim and me set to majestying him, and doing this and that and t’other\r\n      for him, and standing up till he told us we might set down. This\r\n      done him heaps of good, and so he got cheerful and comfortable. But\r\n      the duke kind of soured on him, and didn’t look a bit satisfied with\r\n      the way things was going; still, the king acted real friendly towards him,\r\n      and said the duke’s great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of\r\n      Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by <i>his</i> father, and was\r\n      allowed to come to the palace considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a\r\n      good while, till by and by the king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\r\n      raft, Bilgewater, and so what’s the use o’ your bein’ \r\n      sour? It ’ll only make things oncomfortable. It ain’t\r\n      my fault I warn’t born a duke, it ain’t your fault you warn’t\r\n      born a king—so what’s the use to worry? Make the best o’ \r\n      things the way you find ’em, says I—that’s my motto.\r\n      This ain’t no bad thing that we’ve struck here—plenty\r\n      grub and an easy life—come, give us your hand, duke, and le’s\r\n      all be friends.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it. It took\r\n      away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because it\r\n      would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft;\r\n      for what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be\r\n      satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It didn’t take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn’t\r\n      no kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds. But\r\n      I never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it’s the best\r\n      way; then you don’t have no quarrels, and don’t get into no\r\n      trouble. If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn’t\r\n      no objections, ’long as it would keep peace in the family; and it\r\n      warn’t no use to tell Jim, so I didn’t tell him. If I\r\n      never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt that the best way to get\r\n      along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c19-166\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c19-166.jpg (33K)\" src=\"images/c19-166.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1915087048032011121\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c20-167\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c20\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c20-167.jpg (184K)\" src=\"images/c20-167.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4547737578558301265\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XX.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we covered\r\n      up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of running—was\r\n      Jim a runaway nigger? Says I:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run <i>south</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      No, they allowed he wouldn’t. I had to account for things some\r\n      way, so I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born,\r\n      and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike. Pa, he\r\n      ’lowed he’d break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who’s\r\n      got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.\r\n      Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he’d squared\r\n      up there warn’t nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger,\r\n      Jim. That warn’t enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck\r\n      passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak\r\n      of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we’d\r\n      go down to Orleans on it. Pa’s luck didn’t hold out; a\r\n      steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all\r\n      went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but\r\n      pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no\r\n      more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble,\r\n      because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away\r\n      from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don’t\r\n      run daytimes no more now; nights they don’t bother us.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if\r\n      we want to. I’ll think the thing over—I’ll invent\r\n      a plan that’ll fix it. We’ll let it alone for to-day, because\r\n      of course we don’t want to go by that town yonder in daylight—it\r\n      mightn’t be healthy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat lightning\r\n      was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was beginning to\r\n      shiver—it was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see that.\r\n      So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see what\r\n      the beds was like. My bed was a straw tick better than Jim’s,\r\n      which was a corn-shuck tick; there’s always cobs around about in a\r\n      shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the\r\n      dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\r\n      makes such a rustling that you wake up. Well, the duke allowed he\r\n      would take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn’t. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you\r\n      that a corn-shuck bed warn’t just fitten for me to sleep on. Your\r\n      Grace ’ll take the shuck bed yourself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was going\r\n      to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when the duke\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “’Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron\r\n      heel of oppression. Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I\r\n      yield, I submit; ’tis my fate. I am alone in the world—let\r\n      me suffer; can bear it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to\r\n      stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till\r\n      we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little\r\n      bunch of lights by and by—that was the town, you know—and slid\r\n      by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters\r\n      of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o’clock\r\n      it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so\r\n      the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then\r\n      him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.\r\n      It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn’t a turned in\r\n      anyway if I’d had a bed, because a body don’t see such a storm\r\n      as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how\r\n      the wind did scream along! And every second or two there’d\r\n      come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you’d\r\n      see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing\r\n      around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!—bum! bum!\r\n      bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum—and the thunder would go rumbling\r\n      and grumbling away, and quit—and then RIP comes another flash and\r\n      another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft\r\n      sometimes, but I hadn’t any clothes on, and didn’t mind.\r\n      We didn’t have no trouble about snags; the lightning was\r\n      glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty\r\n      soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time, so\r\n      Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\r\n      mighty good that way, Jim was. I crawled into the wigwam, but the\r\n      king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn’t no\r\n      show for me; so I laid outside—I didn’t mind the rain, because\r\n      it was warm, and the waves warn’t running so high now. About\r\n      two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he\r\n      changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn’t high enough yet to\r\n      do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a\r\n      sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most\r\n      killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever\r\n      was, anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by the\r\n      storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed I\r\n      rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and\r\n      the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got\r\n      tired of it, and allowed they would “lay out a campaign,” as\r\n      they called it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a\r\n      lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said,\r\n      “The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,” would\r\n      “lecture on the Science of Phrenology” at such and such a\r\n      place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and “furnish\r\n      charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece.” The duke\r\n      said that was <i>him</i>. In another bill he was the “world-renowned\r\n      Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London.”\r\n      In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful\r\n      things, like finding water and gold with a “divining-rod,”\r\n      “dissipating witch spells,” and so on. By and by he\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But the histrionic muse is the darling. Have you ever trod\r\n      the boards, Royalty?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” says the king.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You shall, then, before you’re three days older, Fallen\r\n      Grandeur,” says the duke. “The first good town we come to we’ll\r\n      hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III. and the balcony scene\r\n      in Romeo and Juliet. How does that strike you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay,\r\n      Bilgewater; but, you see, I don’t know nothing about play-actin’,\r\n      and hain’t ever seen much of it. I was too small when pap used\r\n      to have ’em at the palace. Do you reckon you can learn me?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Easy!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right. I’m jist a-freezn’ for something\r\n      fresh, anyway. Le’s commence right away.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\r\n      said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But if Juliet’s such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my\r\n      white whiskers is goin’ to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, don’t you worry; these country jakes won’t ever\r\n      think of that. Besides, you know, you’ll be in costume, and that\r\n      makes all the difference in the world; Juliet’s in a balcony,\r\n      enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed, and she’s got on her\r\n      night-gown and her ruffled nightcap. Here are the costumes for the\r\n      parts.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c20-170\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c20-170.jpg (62K)\" src=\"images/c20-170.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8717866107751699928\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was meedyevil\r\n      armor for Richard III. and t’other chap, and a long white cotton\r\n      nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match. The king was satisfied;\r\n      so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid\r\n      spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same time, to show how\r\n      it had got to be done; then he give the book to the king and told him to\r\n      get his part by heart.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\r\n      after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\r\n      in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would go\r\n      down to the town and fix that thing. The king allowed he would go,\r\n      too, and see if he couldn’t strike something. We was out of\r\n      coffee, so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got there there warn’t nobody stirring; streets empty, and\r\n      perfectly dead and still, like Sunday. We found a sick nigger\r\n      sunning himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn’t\r\n      too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile\r\n      back in the woods. The king got the directions, and allowed he’d\r\n      go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke said what he was after was a printing-office. We found it;\r\n      a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shop—carpenters and\r\n      printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked. It was a\r\n      dirty, littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures\r\n      of horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls. The duke\r\n      shed his coat and said he was all right now. So me and the king lit\r\n      out for the camp-meeting.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\r\n      awful hot day. There was as much as a thousand people there from\r\n      twenty mile around. The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\r\n      everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the\r\n      flies. There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\r\n      branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\r\n      watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\r\n      bigger and held crowds of people. The benches was made out of\r\n      outside slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks\r\n      into for legs. They didn’t have no backs. The preachers had\r\n      high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds. The women had on\r\n      sun-bonnets; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a\r\n      few of the young ones had on calico. Some of the young men was\r\n      barefooted, and some of the children didn’t have on any clothes but\r\n      just a tow-linen shirt. Some of the old women was knitting, and some\r\n      of the young folks was courting on the sly.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c20-172\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c20-172.jpg (72K)\" src=\"images/c20-172.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6958750341907267577\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He\r\n      lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear\r\n      it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\r\n      he lined out two more for them to sing—and so on. The people\r\n      woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end\r\n      some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher\r\n      begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one\r\n      side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the\r\n      front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting\r\n      his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\r\n      his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\r\n      that, shouting, “It’s the brazen serpent in the wilderness!\r\n      Look upon it and live!” And people would shout out,\r\n      “Glory!—A-a-<i>men</i>!” And so he went on, and\r\n      the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, come to the mourners’ bench! come, black with sin! (<i>Amen</i>!)\r\n      come, sick and sore! (<i>Amen</i>!) come, lame and halt and blind! (<i>Amen</i>!)\r\n      come, pore and needy, sunk in shame! (<i>A-A-Men</i>!) come, all that’s\r\n      worn and soiled and suffering!—come with a broken spirit! come with\r\n      a contrite heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that\r\n      cleanse is free, the door of heaven stands open—oh, enter in and be\r\n      at rest!” (<i>A-A-Men</i>! <i>Glory, Glory Hallelujah!</i>)\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so on. You couldn’t make out what the preacher said any\r\n      more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up\r\n      everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to\r\n      the mourners’ bench, with the tears running down their faces; and\r\n      when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd,\r\n      they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy\r\n      and wild.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over\r\n      everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the\r\n      preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He\r\n      told them he was a pirate—been a pirate for thirty years out in the\r\n      Indian Ocean—and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring\r\n      in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to\r\n      goodness he’d been robbed last night and put ashore off of a\r\n      steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest\r\n      thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and\r\n      happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to\r\n      start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the\r\n      rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he\r\n      could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate\r\n      crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there\r\n      without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a\r\n      pirate he would say to him, “Don’t you thank me, don’t\r\n      you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville\r\n      camp-meeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear\r\n      preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c20-174\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c20-174.jpg (45K)\" src=\"images/c20-174.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7885361215315736006\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody\r\n      sings out, “Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!”\r\n      Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out,\r\n      “Let <i>him</i> pass the hat around!” Then everybody\r\n      said it, the preacher too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and\r\n      blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good\r\n      to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest\r\n      kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask\r\n      him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done\r\n      it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times—and\r\n      he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their\r\n      houses, and said they’d think it was an honor; but he said as this\r\n      was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn’t do no good, and\r\n      besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to\r\n      work on the pirates.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had\r\n      collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he\r\n      had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a\r\n      wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said,\r\n      take it all around, it laid over any day he’d ever put in in the\r\n      missionarying line. He said it warn’t no use talking, heathens\r\n      don’t amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting\r\n      with.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke was thinking <i>he’d</i> been doing pretty well till the\r\n      king come to show up, but after that he didn’t think so so much.\r\n      He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that\r\n      printing-office—horse bills—and took the money, four dollars.\r\n      And he had got in ten dollars’ worth of advertisements for the\r\n      paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in\r\n      advance—so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a\r\n      year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on\r\n      condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in\r\n      cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern\r\n      and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to\r\n      run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made,\r\n      himself, out of his own head—three verses—kind of sweet and\r\n      saddish—the name of it was, “Yes, crush, cold world, this\r\n      breaking heart”—and he left that all set up and ready to print\r\n      in the paper, and didn’t charge nothing for it. Well, he took\r\n      in nine dollars and a half, and said he’d done a pretty square day’s\r\n      work for it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he showed us another little job he’d printed and hadn’t\r\n      charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway\r\n      nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and “$200 reward”\r\n      under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a\r\n      dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques’ plantation, forty\r\n      mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever\r\n      would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c20-175\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c20-175.jpg (56K)\" src=\"images/c20-175.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2478327013922066423\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now,” says the duke, “after to-night we can run in the\r\n      daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim\r\n      hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this\r\n      handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel\r\n      on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and\r\n      are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look\r\n      still better on Jim, but it wouldn’t go well with the story of us\r\n      being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct\r\n      thing—we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We all said the duke was pretty smart, and there couldn’t be no\r\n      trouble about running daytimes. We judged we could make miles enough\r\n      that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke’s\r\n      work in the printing office was going to make in that little town; then we\r\n      could boom right along if we wanted to.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We laid low and kept still, and never shoved out till nearly ten o’clock;\r\n      then we slid by, pretty wide away from the town, and didn’t hoist\r\n      our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Huck, does you reck’n we gwyne to run acrost any mo’ \r\n      kings on dis trip?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” I says, “I reckon not.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” says he, “dat’s all right, den. I\r\n      doan’ mine one er two kings, but dat’s enough. Dis one’s\r\n      powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much better.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French, so he could hear\r\n      what it was like; but he said he had been in this country so long, and had\r\n      so much trouble, he’d forgot it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <a id=\"c21-177\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c21\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-177.jpg (174K)\" src=\"images/c21-177.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7996225549914840621\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was after sun-up now, but we went right on and didn’t tie up.\r\n      The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty; but\r\n      after they’d jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a\r\n      good deal. After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the\r\n      raft, and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches, and let his\r\n      legs dangle in the water, so as to be comfortable, and lit his pipe, and\r\n      went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart. When he had got it\r\n      pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together. The duke\r\n      had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech; and he made\r\n      him sigh, and put his hand on his heart, and after a while he said he done\r\n      it pretty well; “only,” he says, “you mustn’t\r\n      bellow out <i>Romeo</i>! that way, like a bull—you must say it soft\r\n      and sick and languishy, so—R-o-o-meo! that is the idea; for Juliet’s\r\n      a dear sweet mere child of a girl, you know, and she doesn’t bray\r\n      like a jackass.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of\r\n      oak laths, and begun to practice the sword fight—the duke called\r\n      himself Richard III.; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft\r\n      was grand to see. But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard,\r\n      and after that they took a rest, and had a talk about all kinds of\r\n      adventures they’d had in other times along the river.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After dinner the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, Capet, we’ll want to make this a first-class show, you\r\n      know, so I guess we’ll add a little more to it. We want a\r\n      little something to answer encores with, anyway.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s onkores, Bilgewater?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke told him, and then says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor’s\r\n      hornpipe; and you—well, let me see—oh, I’ve got it—you\r\n      can do Hamlet’s soliloquy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hamlet’s which?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hamlet’s soliloquy, you know; the most celebrated thing in\r\n      Shakespeare. Ah, it’s sublime, sublime! Always fetches the\r\n      house. I haven’t got it in the book—I’ve only got\r\n      one volume—but I reckon I can piece it out from memory.

It was beautiful to\r\n      see him. By and by he got it. He told us to give attention. Then\r\n      he strikes a most noble attitude, with one leg shoved forwards, and his\r\n      arms stretched away up, and his head tilted back, looking up at the sky;\r\n      and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth; and after that, all\r\n      through his speech, he howled, and spread around, and swelled up his\r\n      chest, and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before.\r\n      This is the speech—I learned it, easy enough, while he was\r\n      learning it to the king:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-179.jpg (149K)\" src=\"images/c21-179.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1029389681050676443\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-180.jpg (145K)\" src=\"images/c21-180.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4967103507461481737\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<img alt=\"c21-181.jpg (157K)\" height=\"1004\" src=\"images/c21-181.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" width=\"771\" id=\"id-8589175714322981064\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n  To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin<br>\r\n  That makes calamity of so long life;<br>\r\n  For who would fardels bear, till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane,<br>\r\n  But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep,<br>\r\n  Great nature’s second course,<br>\r\n  And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune<br>\r\n  Than fly to others that we know not of.<br>\r\n  There’s the respect must give us pause:<br>\r\n  Wake Duncan with thy knocking!

The circus would leave before\r\n      night, so our show would have a pretty good chance. The duke he hired the\r\n      court house, and we went around and stuck up our bills.

The stores and houses was most all\r\n      old shackly dried-up frame concerns that hadn’t ever been painted;\r\n      they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts, so as to be out\r\n      of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little\r\n      gardens around them, but they didn’t seem to raise hardly anything\r\n      in them but jimpson weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old\r\n      curled-up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out\r\n      tin-ware. The fences was made of different kinds of boards, nailed on at\r\n      different times; and they leaned every which-way, and had gates that didn’t\r\n      generly have but one hinge—a leather one. Some of the fences had\r\n      been whitewashed, some time or another, but the duke said it was in\r\n      Clumbus’s time, like enough. There was generly hogs in the garden,\r\n      and people driving them out.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All the stores was along one street. They had white domestic awnings\r\n      in front, and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts.\r\n      There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings, and loafers roosting on\r\n      them all day long, whittling them with their Barlow knives; and chawing\r\n      tobacco, and gaping and yawning and stretching—a mighty ornery lot.\r\n      They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella, but\r\n      didn’t wear no coats nor waistcoats, they called one another Bill,\r\n      and Buck, and Hank, and Joe, and Andy, and talked lazy and drawly, and\r\n      used considerable many cuss words. There was as many as one loafer\r\n      leaning up against every awning-post, and he most always had his hands in\r\n      his britches-pockets, except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of\r\n      tobacco or scratch. What a body was hearing amongst them all the\r\n      time was:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gimme a chaw ’v tobacker, Hank.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cain’t; I hain’t got but one chaw left. Ask Bill.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c21-182\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-182.jpg (78K)\" src=\"images/c21-182.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2953816322249949621\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw; maybe he lies and says he ain’t got\r\n      none. Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world, nor a\r\n      chaw of tobacco of their own. They get all their chawing by\r\n      borrowing; they say to a fellow, “I wisht you’d len’ me\r\n      a chaw, Jack, I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had”—which\r\n      is a lie pretty much everytime; it don’t fool nobody but a stranger;\r\n      but Jack ain’t no stranger, so he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>You</i> give him a chaw, did you? So did your sister’s\r\n      cat’s grandmother. You pay me back the chaws you’ve awready\r\n      borry’d off’n me, Lafe Buckner, then I’ll loan you one\r\n      or two ton of it, and won’t charge you no back intrust, nuther.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I <i>did</i> pay you back some of it wunst.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, you did—’bout six chaws. You borry’d\r\n      store tobacker and paid back nigger-head.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Store tobacco is flat black plug, but these fellows mostly chaws the\r\n      natural leaf twisted. When they borrow a chaw they don’t\r\n      generly cut it off with a knife, but set the plug in between their teeth,\r\n      and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they\r\n      get it in two; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful\r\n      at it when it’s handed back, and says, sarcastic:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here, gimme the <i>chaw</i>, and you take the <i>plug</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All the streets and lanes was just mud; they warn’t nothing else <i>but</i>\r\n      mud—mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places,\r\n      and two or three inches deep in <i>all</i> the places. The hogs\r\n      loafed and grunted around everywheres. You’d see a muddy sow\r\n      and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself\r\n      right down in the way, where folks had to walk around her, and she’d\r\n      stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was\r\n      milking her, and look as happy as if she was on salary. And pretty soon\r\n      you’d hear a loafer sing out, “Hi! <i>so</i> boy! sick\r\n      him, Tige!” and away the sow would go, squealing most horrible, with\r\n      a dog or two swinging to each ear, and three or four dozen more a-coming;\r\n      and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of\r\n      sight, and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise. Then\r\n      they’d settle back again till there was a dog fight. There\r\n      couldn’t anything wake them up all over, and make them happy all\r\n      over, like a dog fight—unless it might be putting turpentine on a\r\n      stray dog and setting fire to him, or tying a tin pan to his tail and see\r\n      him run himself to death.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank, and\r\n      they was bowed and bent, and about ready to tumble in. The people had\r\n      moved out of them. The bank was caved away under one corner of some\r\n      others, and that corner was hanging over. People lived in them yet,\r\n      but it was dangersome, because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a\r\n      house caves in at a time. Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a\r\n      mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves\r\n      into the river in one summer. Such a town as that has to be always moving\r\n      back, and back, and back, because the river’s always gnawing at it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons\r\n      and horses in the streets, and more coming all the time. Families\r\n      fetched their dinners with them from the country, and eat them in the\r\n      wagons. There was considerable whisky drinking going on, and I seen\r\n      three fights. By and by somebody sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here comes old Boggs!—in from the country for his little old\r\n      monthly drunk; here he comes, boys!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All the loafers looked glad; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of\r\n      Boggs. One of them says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Wonder who he’s a-gwyne to chaw up this time. If he’d\r\n      a-chawed up all the men he’s ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last\r\n      twenty year he’d have considerable ruputation now.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Another one says, “I wisht old Boggs ’d threaten me, ’cuz\r\n      then I’d know I warn’t gwyne to die for a thousan’ year.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse, whooping and yelling like an\r\n      Injun, and singing out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cler the track, thar. I’m on the waw-path, and the\r\n      price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c21-185\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-185.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c21-185.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-618634959404569452\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was drunk, and weaving about in his saddle; he was over fifty year old,\r\n      and had a very red face. Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him\r\n      and sassed him, and he sassed back, and said he’d attend to them and\r\n      lay them out in their regular turns, but he couldn’t wait now\r\n      because he’d come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn, and his\r\n      motto was, “Meat first, and spoon vittles to top off on.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He see me, and rode up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Whar’d you come f’m, boy? You prepared to die?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he rode on. I was scared, but a man says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He don’t mean nothing; he’s always a-carryin’ on\r\n      like that when he’s drunk. He’s the best naturedest old\r\n      fool in Arkansaw—never hurt nobody, drunk nor sober.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town, and bent his head down so\r\n      he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Come out here, Sherburn! Come out and meet the man you’ve\r\n      swindled. You’re the houn’ I’m after, and I’m\r\n      a-gwyne to have you, too!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so he went on, calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to,\r\n      and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going\r\n      on. By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five—and he was\r\n      a heap the best dressed man in that town, too—steps out of the\r\n      store, and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come. He\r\n      says to Boggs, mighty ca’m and slow—he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m tired of this, but I’ll endure it till one o’clock.\r\n      Till one o’clock, mind—no longer. If you open your\r\n      mouth against me only once after that time you can’t travel so far\r\n      but I will find you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he turns and goes in. The crowd looked mighty sober; nobody\r\n      stirred, and there warn’t no more laughing. Boggs rode off\r\n      blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell, all down the street; and\r\n      pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store, still keeping it up.\r\n      Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up, but he\r\n      wouldn’t; they told him it would be one o’clock in about\r\n      fifteen minutes, and so he <i>must</i> go home—he must go right\r\n      away. But it didn’t do no good. He cussed away with all\r\n      his might, and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it, and\r\n      pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again, with his gray\r\n      hair a-flying. Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best\r\n      to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober;\r\n      but it warn’t no use—up the street he would tear again, and\r\n      give Sherburn another cussing. By and by somebody says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Go for his daughter!—quick, go for his daughter; sometimes he’ll\r\n      listen to her. If anybody can persuade him, she can.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So somebody started on a run. I walked down street a ways and\r\n      stopped. In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again, but not on\r\n      his horse. He was a-reeling across the street towards me,\r\n      bare-headed, with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and\r\n      hurrying him along. He was quiet, and looked uneasy; and he warn’t\r\n      hanging back any, but was doing some of the hurrying himself. Somebody\r\n      sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Boggs!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I looked over there to see who said it, and it was that Colonel Sherburn.\r\n      He was standing perfectly still in the street, and had a pistol raised in\r\n      his right hand—not aiming it, but holding it out with the barrel\r\n      tilted up towards the sky. The same second I see a young girl coming\r\n      on the run, and two men with her. Boggs and the men turned round to\r\n      see who called him, and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one\r\n      side, and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level—both\r\n      barrels cocked. Boggs throws up both of his hands and says, “O Lord,\r\n      don’t shoot!” Bang! goes the first shot, and he staggers\r\n      back, clawing at the air—bang! goes the second one, and he tumbles\r\n      backwards on to the ground, heavy and solid, with his arms spread out.\r\n      That young girl screamed out and comes rushing, and down she throws\r\n      herself on her father, crying, and saying, “Oh, he’s killed\r\n      him, he’s killed him!” The crowd closed up around them,\r\n      and shouldered and jammed one another, with their necks stretched, trying\r\n      to see, and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting,\r\n      “Back, back! give him air, give him air!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c21-187\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c21-187.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c21-187.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1656917673496929703\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground, and turned around\r\n      on his heels and walked off.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They took Boggs to a little drug store, the crowd pressing around just the\r\n      same, and the whole town following, and I rushed and got a good place at\r\n      the window, where I was close to him and could see in. They laid him\r\n      on the floor and put one large Bible under his head, and opened another\r\n      one and spread it on his breast; but they tore open his shirt first, and I\r\n      seen where one of the bullets went in. He made about a dozen long\r\n      gasps, his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath, and\r\n      letting it down again when he breathed it out—and after that he laid\r\n      still; he was dead. Then they pulled his daughter away from him,\r\n      screaming and crying, and took her off. She was about sixteen, and\r\n      very sweet and gentle looking, but awful pale and scared.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, pretty soon the whole town was there, squirming and scrouging and\r\n      pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look, but people that\r\n      had the places wouldn’t give them up, and folks behind them was\r\n      saying all the time, “Say, now, you’ve looked enough, you\r\n      fellows; ’tain’t right and ’tain’t fair for you to\r\n      stay thar all the time, and never give nobody a chance; other folks has\r\n      their rights as well as you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was considerable jawing back, so I slid out, thinking maybe there\r\n      was going to be trouble. The streets was full, and everybody was\r\n      excited. Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened, and\r\n      there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows, stretching\r\n      their necks and listening. One long, lanky man, with long hair and a\r\n      big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head, and a crooked-handled\r\n      cane, marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where\r\n      Sherburn stood, and the people following him around from one place to t’other\r\n      and watching everything he done, and bobbing their heads to show they\r\n      understood, and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs\r\n      to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane; and then he\r\n      stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood, frowning and having\r\n      his hat-brim down over his eyes, and sung out, “Boggs!” and\r\n      then fetched his cane down slow to a level, and says “Bang!”\r\n      staggered backwards, says “Bang!” again, and fell down flat on\r\n      his back. The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect; said\r\n      it was just exactly the way it all happened. Then as much as a dozen\r\n      people got out their bottles and treated him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched. In about\r\n      a minute everybody was saying it; so away they went, mad and yelling, and\r\n      snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c22-189\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c22\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c22-189.jpg (174K)\" src=\"images/c22-189.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5273805164589777652\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They swarmed up towards Sherburn’s house, a-whooping and raging like\r\n      Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to\r\n      mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the\r\n      mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along\r\n      the road was full of women’s heads, and there was nigger boys in\r\n      every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as\r\n      the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of\r\n      reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared\r\n      most to death.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They swarmed up in front of Sherburn’s palings as thick as they\r\n      could jam together, and you couldn’t hear yourself think for the\r\n      noise. It was a little twenty-foot yard. Some sung out “Tear\r\n      down the fence! tear down the fence!” Then there was a racket\r\n      of ripping and tearing and smashing, and down she goes, and the front wall\r\n      of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch,\r\n      with a double-barrel gun in his hand, and takes his stand, perfectly ca’m\r\n      and deliberate, not saying a word. The racket stopped, and the wave\r\n      sucked back.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Sherburn never said a word—just stood there, looking down. The\r\n      stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable. Sherburn run his eye\r\n      slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to\r\n      out-gaze him, but they couldn’t; they dropped their eyes and looked\r\n      sneaky. Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed; not the pleasant kind,\r\n      but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that’s\r\n      got sand in it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he says, slow and scornful:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The idea of <i>you</i> lynching anybody! It’s amusing.\r\n      The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a <i>man</i>!\r\n      Because you’re brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless\r\n      cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit\r\n      enough to lay your hands on a <i>man</i>? Why, a <i>man’s</i>\r\n      safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind—as long as it’s\r\n      daytime and you’re not behind him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Do I know you? I know you clear through. I was born and\r\n      raised in the South, and I’ve lived in the North; so I know the\r\n      average all around. The average man’s a coward. In the North\r\n      he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a\r\n      humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped\r\n      a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your\r\n      newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver\r\n      than any other people—whereas you’re just <i>as</i> brave, and\r\n      no braver. Why don’t your juries hang murderers? Because\r\n      they’re afraid the man’s friends will shoot them in the back,\r\n      in the dark—and it’s just what they <i>would</i> do.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So they always acquit; and then a <i>man</i> goes in the night,\r\n      with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal. Your\r\n      mistake is, that you didn’t bring a man with you; that’s one\r\n      mistake, and the other is that you didn’t come in the dark and fetch\r\n      your masks. You brought <i>part</i> of a man—Buck Harkness,\r\n      there—and if you hadn’t had him to start you, you’d a\r\n      taken it out in blowing.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You didn’t want to come. The average man don’t\r\n      like trouble and danger. <i>You</i> don’t like trouble and danger.\r\n      But if only <i>half</i> a man—like Buck Harkness, there—shouts\r\n      ’Lynch him! lynch him!’ you’re afraid to back down—afraid\r\n      you’ll be found out to be what you are—<i>cowards</i>—and\r\n      so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man’s\r\n      coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you’re\r\n      going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army\r\n      is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in\r\n      them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from\r\n      their officers. But a mob without any <i>man</i> at the head of it\r\n      is <i>beneath</i> pitifulness. Now the thing for <i>you</i> to do is\r\n      to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real\r\n      lynching’s going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern\r\n      fashion; and when they come they’ll bring their masks, and fetch a\r\n      <i>man</i> along. Now <i>leave</i>—and take your half-a-man\r\n      with you”—tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking\r\n      it when he says this.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The crowd washed back sudden, and then broke all apart, and went tearing\r\n      off every which way, and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them, looking\r\n      tolerable cheap. I could a stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t\r\n      want to.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman\r\n      went by, and then dived in under the tent. I had my twenty-dollar\r\n      gold piece and some other money, but I reckoned I better save it, because\r\n      there ain’t no telling how soon you are going to need it, away from\r\n      home and amongst strangers that way. You can’t be too careful.\r\n      I ain’t opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain’t\r\n      no other way, but there ain’t no use in <i>wasting</i> it on them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c22-191\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c22-191.jpg (42K)\" src=\"images/c22-191.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3566165569279399284\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever\r\n      was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side\r\n      by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor\r\n      stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable—there\r\n      must a been twenty of them—and every lady with a lovely complexion,\r\n      and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough\r\n      queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just\r\n      littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see\r\n      anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and\r\n      went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men\r\n      looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and\r\n      skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady’s\r\n      rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking\r\n      like the most loveliest parasol.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot\r\n      out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and\r\n      the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip\r\n      and shouting “Hi!—hi!” and the clown cracking jokes\r\n      behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put\r\n      her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how\r\n      the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the\r\n      other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever\r\n      see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went\r\n      just about wild.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and\r\n      all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The\r\n      ringmaster couldn’t ever say a word to him but he was back at him\r\n      quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\r\n      <i>could</i> think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what\r\n      I couldn’t noway understand. Why, I couldn’t a thought of them\r\n      in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring—said\r\n      he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.\r\n      They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn’t listen,\r\n      and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to\r\n      holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to\r\n      rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to\r\n      pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, “Knock\r\n      him down! throw him out!” and one or two women begun to scream.\r\n      So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped\r\n      there wouldn’t be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he\r\n      wouldn’t make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he\r\n      could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right,\r\n      and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear\r\n      and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle\r\n      trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his\r\n      heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing\r\n      up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure\r\n      enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he\r\n      went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying\r\n      down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to\r\n      the ground on one side, and then t’other one on t’other side,\r\n      and the people just crazy. It warn’t funny to me, though; I\r\n      was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled\r\n      up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the\r\n      next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse\r\n      a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing\r\n      around as easy and comfortable as if he warn’t ever drunk in his\r\n      life—and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them.\r\n      He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and\r\n      altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and\r\n      handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit\r\n      into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum—and finally\r\n      skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and\r\n      everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c22-193\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c22-193.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c22-193.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1968943095526242750\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled, and he <i>was</i> the\r\n      sickest ringmaster you ever see, I reckon. Why, it was one of his\r\n      own men! He had got up that joke all out of his own head, and never\r\n      let on to nobody. Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I\r\n      wouldn’t a been in that ringmaster’s place, not for a thousand\r\n      dollars. I don’t know; there may be bullier circuses than what\r\n      that one was, but I never struck them yet. Anyways, it was plenty good\r\n      enough for <i>me</i>; and wherever I run across it, it can have all of <i>my</i>\r\n      custom every time.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, that night we had <i>our</i> show; but there warn’t only about\r\n      twelve people there—just enough to pay expenses. And they\r\n      laughed all the time, and that made the duke mad; and everybody left,\r\n      anyway, before the show was over, but one boy which was asleep. So\r\n      the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn’t come up to\r\n      Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy—and maybe something\r\n      ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned. He said he could size\r\n      their style. So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping\r\n      paper and some black paint, and drawed off some handbills, and stuck them\r\n      up all over the village. The bills said:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p class=\"center\">\r\nAT THE COURT HOUSE!<br>\r\n<small>FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY</small>!<br>\r\n<i>The World-Renowned Tragedians</i><br>\r\nDAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER!<br>\r\n<small>AND</small><br>\r\nEDMUND KEAN THE ELDER!<br>\r\n<i>Of the London and Continental<br>\r\nTheatres</i>,<br>\r\nIn their Thrilling Tragedy of<br>\r\nTHE KING’S CAMELOPARD<br>\r\n<small>OR</small><br>\r\nTHE ROYAL NONESUCH!!!<br>\r\n<i>Admission 50 cents</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen at the bottom was the biggest line of all—which said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\">\r\nLADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There,” says he, “if that line don’t fetch them, I\r\ndont know Arkansaw!”\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c23-196\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c23\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c23-196.jpg (167K)\" src=\"images/c23-196.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3871589270299950321\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, all day him and the king was hard at it, rigging up a stage and a\r\n      curtain and a row of candles for footlights; and that night the house was\r\n      jam full of men in no time. When the place couldn’t hold no\r\n      more, the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come\r\n      on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech,\r\n      and praised up this tragedy, and said it was the most thrillingest one\r\n      that ever was; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy, and about\r\n      Edmund Kean the Elder, which was to play the main principal part in it;\r\n      and at last when he’d got everybody’s expectations up high\r\n      enough, he rolled up the curtain, and the next minute the king come\r\n      a-prancing out on all fours, naked; and he was painted all over,\r\n      ring-streaked-and-striped, all sorts of colors, as splendid as a rainbow.\r\n      And—but never mind the rest of his outfit; it was just wild,\r\n      but it was awful funny. The people most killed themselves laughing; and\r\n      when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes, they\r\n      roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it\r\n      over again, and after that they made him do it another time. Well, it\r\n      would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the duke he lets the curtain down, and bows to the people, and says\r\n      the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more, on accounts of\r\n      pressing London engagements, where the seats is all sold already for it in\r\n      Drury Lane; and then he makes them another bow, and says if he has\r\n      succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them, he will be deeply\r\n      obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and\r\n      see it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Twenty people sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What, is it over? Is that <i>all</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says yes. Then there was a fine time. Everybody sings\r\n      out, “Sold!” and rose up mad, and was a-going for that stage\r\n      and them tragedians. But a big, fine looking man jumps up on a bench\r\n      and shouts:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on! Just a word, gentlemen.” They stopped to\r\n      listen. “We are sold—mighty badly sold. But we don’t\r\n      want to be the laughing stock of this whole town, I reckon, and never hear\r\n      the last of this thing as long as we live. <i>No</i>. What we\r\n      want is to go out of here quiet, and talk this show up, and sell the <i>rest</i>\r\n      of the town! Then we’ll all be in the same boat. Ain’t\r\n      that sensible?” (“You bet it is!—the jedge is right!”\r\n      everybody sings out.) “All right, then—not a word about any\r\n      sell. Go along home, and advise everybody to come and see the\r\n      tragedy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next day you couldn’t hear nothing around that town but how splendid\r\n      that show was. House was jammed again that night, and we sold this\r\n      crowd the same way. When me and the king and the duke got home to\r\n      the raft we all had a supper; and by and by, about midnight, they made Jim\r\n      and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river, and fetch\r\n      her in and hide her about two mile below town.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The third night the house was crammed again—and they warn’t\r\n      new-comers this time, but people that was at the show the other two\r\n      nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man\r\n      that went in had his pockets bulging, or something muffled up under his\r\n      coat—and I see it warn’t no perfumery, neither, not by a long\r\n      sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and\r\n      such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and I bet\r\n      I do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a\r\n      minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn’t stand it. Well,\r\n      when the place couldn’t hold no more people the duke he give a\r\n      fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he\r\n      started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned\r\n      the corner and was in the dark he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Walk fast now till you get away from the houses, and then shin for\r\n      the raft like the dickens was after you!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I done it, and he done the same. We struck the raft at the same\r\n      time, and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream, all dark\r\n      and still, and edging towards the middle of the river, nobody saying a\r\n      word. I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the\r\n      audience, but nothing of the sort; pretty soon he crawls out from under\r\n      the wigwam, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, how’d the old thing pan out this time, duke?”\r\n      He hadn’t been up-town at all.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village. Then\r\n      we lit up and had a supper, and the king and the duke fairly laughed their\r\n      bones loose over the way they’d served them people. The duke\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Greenhorns, flatheads! I knew the first house would keep mum\r\n      and let the rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they’d lay for\r\n      us the third night, and consider it was <i>their</i> turn now. Well,\r\n      it <i>is</i> their turn, and I’d give something to know how much\r\n      they’d take for it. I <i>would</i> just like to know how they’re\r\n      putting in their opportunity.

Look at\r\n      Henry the Eight; this ’n ’s a Sunday-school Superintendent to\r\n      <i>him</i>. And look at Charles Second, and Louis Fourteen, and\r\n      Louis Fifteen, and James Second, and Edward Second, and Richard Third, and\r\n      forty more; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so\r\n      in old times and raise Cain. My, you ought to seen old Henry the\r\n      Eight when he was in bloom. He <i>was</i> a blossom. He used\r\n      to marry a new wife every day, and chop off her head next morning. And\r\n      he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs. ‘Fetch\r\n      up Nell Gwynn,’ he says. They fetch her up. Next morning,\r\n      ‘Chop off her head!’ And they chop it off. ‘Fetch\r\n      up Jane Shore,’ he says; and up she comes, Next morning, ‘Chop\r\n      off her head’—and they chop it off. ‘Ring up Fair\r\n      Rosamun.’ Fair Rosamun answers the bell. Next morning,\r\n      ‘Chop off her head.’ And he made every one of them tell\r\n      him a tale every night; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand\r\n      and one tales that way, and then he put them all in a book, and called it\r\n      Domesday Book—which was a good name and stated the case. You\r\n      don’t know kings, Jim, but I know them; and this old rip of ourn is\r\n      one of the cleanest I’ve struck in history. Well, Henry he\r\n      takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country. How does\r\n      he go at it—give notice?—give the country a show? No.\r\n      All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard,\r\n      and whacks out a declaration of independence, and dares them to come on.\r\n      That was <i>his</i> style—he never give anybody a chance.\r\n      He had suspicions of his father, the Duke of Wellington. Well,\r\n      what did he do? Ask him to show up? No—drownded him in a\r\n      butt of mamsey, like a cat. S’pose people left money laying\r\n      around where he was—what did he do? He collared it. S’pose\r\n      he contracted to do a thing, and you paid him, and didn’t set down\r\n      there and see that he done it—what did he do? He always done\r\n      the other thing. S’pose he opened his mouth—what then? If\r\n      he didn’t shut it up powerful quick he’d lose a lie every\r\n      time. That’s the kind of a bug Henry was; and if we’d a\r\n      had him along ’stead of our kings he’d a fooled that town a\r\n      heap worse than ourn done. I don’t say that ourn is lambs,\r\n      because they ain’t, when you come right down to the cold facts; but\r\n      they ain’t nothing to <i>that</i> old ram, anyway. All I say\r\n      is, kings is kings, and you got to make allowances. Take them all\r\n      around, they’re a mighty ornery lot. It’s the way they’re\r\n      raised.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c23-200\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c23-200.jpg (54K)\" src=\"images/c23-200.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7336104368382318615\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But dis one do <i>smell</i> so like de nation, Huck.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, they all do, Jim.

He\r\n      often done that. When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting\r\n      there with his head down betwixt his knees, moaning and mourning to\r\n      himself. I didn’t take notice nor let on. I knowed what\r\n      it was about. He was thinking about his wife and his children, away\r\n      up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn’t ever been\r\n      away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much\r\n      for his people as white folks does for their’n. It don’t\r\n      seem natural, but I reckon it’s so. He was often moaning and\r\n      mourning that way nights, when he judged I was asleep, and saying, “Po’ \r\n      little ’Lizabeth! po’ little Johnny! it’s mighty hard; I\r\n      spec’ I ain’t ever gwyne to see you no mo’, no mo’!”\r\n      He was a mighty good nigger, Jim was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young\r\n      ones; and by and by he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What makes me feel so bad dis time ’uz bekase I hear sumpn\r\n      over yonder on de bank like a whack, er a slam, while ago, en it mine me\r\n      er de time I treat my little ’Lizabeth so ornery.

Jim\r\n      he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn’t take but a few\r\n      hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay\r\n      all day in the wigwam tied with the rope. You see, when we left him\r\n      all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all by\r\n      himself and not tied it wouldn’t look much like he was a runaway\r\n      nigger, you know. So the duke said it <i>was</i> kind of hard to have to\r\n      lay roped all day, and he’d cipher out some way to get around it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it. He\r\n      dressed Jim up in King Lear’s outfit—it was a long\r\n      curtain-calico gown, and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he\r\n      took his theater paint and painted Jim’s face and hands and ears and\r\n      neck all over a dead, dull, solid blue, like a man that’s been\r\n      drownded nine days. Blamed if he warn’t the horriblest looking\r\n      outrage I ever see. Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a\r\n      shingle so:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Sick Arab—but harmless when not out of his head.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\r\n      foot in front of the wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He said it was\r\n      a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling\r\n      all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make\r\n      himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must\r\n      hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\r\n      a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\r\n      Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and\r\n      he wouldn’t wait for him to howl. Why, he didn’t only\r\n      look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was so\r\n      much money in it, but they judged it wouldn’t be safe, because maybe\r\n      the news might a worked along down by this time. They couldn’t\r\n      hit no project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned\r\n      he’d lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn’t\r\n      put up something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would\r\n      drop over to t’other village without any plan, but just trust in\r\n      Providence to lead him the profitable way—meaning the devil, I\r\n      reckon. We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last; and\r\n      now the king put his’n on, and he told me to put mine on. I\r\n      done it, of course. The king’s duds was all black, and he did\r\n      look real swell and starchy. I never knowed how clothes could change\r\n      a body before. Why, before, he looked like the orneriest old rip\r\n      that ever was; but now, when he’d take off his new white beaver and\r\n      make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand and good and pious that\r\n      you’d say he had walked right out of the ark, and maybe was old\r\n      Leviticus himself. Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I got my paddle\r\n      ready. There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under\r\n      the point, about three mile above the town—been there a couple of\r\n      hours, taking on freight. Says the king:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Seein’ how I’m dressed, I reckon maybe I better arrive\r\n      down from St. Louis or Cincinnati, or some other big place. Go for\r\n      the steamboat, Huckleberry; we’ll come down to the village on her.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride.\r\n      I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village, and then went\r\n      scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water. Pretty soon we come\r\n      to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing\r\n      the sweat off of his face, for it was powerful warm weather; and he had a\r\n      couple of big carpet-bags by him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Run her nose in shore,” says the king. I done it.\r\n      “Wher’ you bound for, young man?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “For the steamboat; going to Orleans.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Git aboard,” says the king. “Hold on a minute, my\r\n      servant ’ll he’p you with them bags. Jump out and he’p\r\n      the gentleman, Adolphus”—meaning me, I see.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c24-205\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c24-205.jpg (40K)\" src=\"images/c24-205.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8757606736094852716\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I done so, and then we all three started on again. The young chap\r\n      was mighty thankful; said it was tough work toting his baggage such\r\n      weather. He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he’d\r\n      come down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now\r\n      he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there. The\r\n      young fellow says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “When I first see you I says to myself, ‘It’s Mr. Wilks,\r\n      sure, and he come mighty near getting here in time.’ But then\r\n      I says again, ‘No, I reckon it ain’t him, or else he wouldn’t\r\n      be paddling up the river.’ You <i>ain’t</i> him, are\r\n      you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, my name’s Blodgett—Elexander Blodgett—<i>Reverend</i>\r\n      Elexander Blodgett, I s’pose I must say, as I’m one o’ \r\n      the Lord’s poor servants. But still I’m jist as able to\r\n      be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time, all the same, if he’s\r\n      missed anything by it—which I hope he hasn’t.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, he don’t miss any property by it, because he’ll\r\n      get that all right; but he’s missed seeing his brother Peter die—which\r\n      he mayn’t mind, nobody can tell as to that—but his brother\r\n      would a give anything in this world to see <i>him</i> before he died;\r\n      never talked about nothing else all these three weeks; hadn’t seen\r\n      him since they was boys together—and hadn’t ever seen his\r\n      brother William at all—that’s the deef and dumb one—William\r\n      ain’t more than thirty or thirty-five. Peter and George were\r\n      the only ones that come out here; George was the married brother; him and\r\n      his wife both died last year. Harvey and William’s the only\r\n      ones that’s left now; and, as I was saying, they haven’t got\r\n      here in time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did anybody send ’em word?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes; a month or two ago, when Peter was first took; because\r\n      Peter said then that he sorter felt like he warn’t going to get well\r\n      this time. You see, he was pretty old, and George’s g’yirls\r\n      was too young to be much company for him, except Mary Jane, the red-headed\r\n      one; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died, and\r\n      didn’t seem to care much to live. He most desperately wanted\r\n      to see Harvey—and William, too, for that matter—because he was\r\n      one of them kind that can’t bear to make a will. He left a\r\n      letter behind for Harvey, and said he’d told in it where his money\r\n      was hid, and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George’s\r\n      g’yirls would be all right—for George didn’t leave\r\n      nothing. And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why do you reckon Harvey don’t come? Wher’ does\r\n      he live?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, he lives in England—Sheffield—preaches there—hasn’t\r\n      ever been in this country. He hasn’t had any too much time—and\r\n      besides he mightn’t a got the letter at all, you know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Too bad, too bad he couldn’t a lived to see his brothers,\r\n      poor soul. You going to Orleans, you say?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, but that ain’t only a part of it. I’m going\r\n      in a ship, next Wednesday, for Ryo Janeero, where my uncle lives.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a pretty long journey. But it’ll be lovely;\r\n      wisht I was a-going. Is Mary Jane the oldest? How old is the others?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mary Jane’s nineteen, Susan’s fifteen, and Joanna’s\r\n      about fourteen—that’s the one that gives herself to good works\r\n      and has a hare-lip.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, they could be worse off. Old Peter had friends, and\r\n      they ain’t going to let them come to no harm. There’s\r\n      Hobson, the Babtis’ preacher; and Deacon Lot Hovey, and Ben Rucker,\r\n      and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, the lawyer; and Dr. Robinson, and\r\n      their wives, and the widow Bartley, and—well, there’s a lot of\r\n      them; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with, and used to\r\n      write about sometimes, when he wrote home; so Harvey ’ll know where\r\n      to look for friends when he gets here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c24-207\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c24-207.jpg (71K)\" src=\"images/c24-207.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8763872784761437286\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied\r\n      that young fellow.

Then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Because she’s a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn’t\r\n      stop there.

A Cincinnati boat will, but this is a St. Louis one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Was Peter Wilks well off?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes, pretty well off. He had houses and land, and it’s\r\n      reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som’ers.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “When did you say he died?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I didn’t say, but it was last night.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Funeral to-morrow, likely?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, ’bout the middle of the day.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it’s all terrible sad; but we’ve all got to go,\r\n      one time or another. So what we want to do is to be prepared; then we’re\r\n      all right.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, sir, it’s the best way. Ma used to always say\r\n      that.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we struck the boat she was about done loading, and pretty soon she\r\n      got off. The king never said nothing about going aboard, so I lost\r\n      my ride, after all. When the boat was gone the king made me paddle\r\n      up another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\r\n      carpet-bags. And if he’s gone over to t’other side, go\r\n      over there and git him. And tell him to git himself up regardless.\r\n      Shove along, now.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see what <i>he</i> was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.\r\n      When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe, and then they set\r\n      down on a log, and the king told him everything, just like the young\r\n      fellow had said it—every last word of it. And all the time he\r\n      was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty\r\n      well, too, for a slouch. I can’t imitate him, and so I ain’t\r\n      a-going to try to; but he really done it pretty good. Then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef and\r\n      dumb person on the histronic boards. So then they waited for a\r\n      steamboat.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along, but\r\n      they didn’t come from high enough up the river; but at last there\r\n      was a big one, and they hailed her. She sent out her yawl, and we\r\n      went aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only\r\n      wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a\r\n      cussing, and said they wouldn’t land us. But the king was ca’m.\r\n      He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on\r\n      and put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry ’em, can’t\r\n      it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\r\n      village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when\r\n      they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher’ Mr. Peter Wilks lives?”\r\n      they give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to\r\n      say, “What d’ I tell you?” Then one of them says,\r\n      kind of soft and gentle:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he\r\n      <i>did</i> live yesterday evening.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\r\n      against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\r\n      back, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Alas, alas, our poor brother—gone, and we never got to see\r\n      him; oh, it’s too, too hard!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c24-209\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c24-209.jpg (56K)\" src=\"images/c24-209.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3190845962221111292\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the\r\n      duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn’t drop a carpet-bag and\r\n      bust out a-crying. If they warn’t the beatenest lot, them two\r\n      frauds, that ever I struck.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\r\n      sorts of kind things to them, and carried their carpet-bags up the hill\r\n      for them, and let them lean on them and cry, and told the king all about\r\n      his brother’s last moments, and the king he told it all over again\r\n      on his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner\r\n      like they’d lost the twelve disciples.

Pretty soon we was in the middle of a\r\n      crowd, and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march. The\r\n      windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over\r\n      a fence:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Is it <i>them</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You bet it is.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed, and the\r\n      three girls was standing in the door. Mary Jane <i>was</i>\r\n      red-headed, but that don’t make no difference, she was most awful\r\n      beautiful, and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory, she was so\r\n      glad her uncles was come. The king he spread his arms, and Mary Jane she\r\n      jumped for them, and the hare-lip jumped for the duke, and there they had\r\n      it! Everybody most, leastways women, cried for joy to see them meet\r\n      again at last and have such good times.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the king he hunched the duke private—I see him do it—and\r\n      then he looked around and see the coffin, over in the corner on two\r\n      chairs; so then him and the duke, with a hand across each other’s\r\n      shoulder, and t’other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn\r\n      over there, everybody dropping back to give them room, and all the talk\r\n      and noise stopping, people saying “Sh!” and all the men taking\r\n      their hats off and drooping their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.\r\n      And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin, and\r\n      took one sight, and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them\r\n      to Orleans, most; and then they put their arms around each other’s\r\n      necks, and hung their chins over each other’s shoulders; and then\r\n      for three minutes, or maybe four, I never see two men leak the way they\r\n      done. And, mind you, everybody was doing the same; and the place was\r\n      that damp I never see anything like it. Then one of them got on one side\r\n      of the coffin, and t’other on t’other side, and they kneeled\r\n      down and rested their foreheads on the coffin, and let on to pray all to\r\n      themselves. Well, when it come to that it worked the crowd like you\r\n      never see anything like it, and everybody broke down and went to sobbing\r\n      right out loud—the poor girls, too; and every woman, nearly, went up\r\n      to the girls, without saying a word, and kissed them, solemn, on the\r\n      forehead, and then put their hand on their head, and looked up towards the\r\n      sky, with the tears running down, and then busted out and went off sobbing\r\n      and swabbing, and give the next woman a show. I never see anything\r\n      so disgusting.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c25-212\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c25-212.jpg (44K)\" src=\"images/c25-212.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6940470279990025260\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little, and works\r\n      himself up and slobbers out a speech, all full of tears and flapdoodle\r\n      about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the\r\n      diseased, and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four\r\n      thousand mile, but it’s a trial that’s sweetened and\r\n      sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears, and so he\r\n      thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother’s heart, because\r\n      out of their mouths they can’t, words being too weak and cold, and\r\n      all that kind of rot and slush, till it was just sickening; and then he\r\n      blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen, and turns himself loose and goes to\r\n      crying fit to bust.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd\r\n      struck up the doxolojer, and everybody joined in with all their might, and\r\n      it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out.\r\n      Music is a good thing; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never\r\n      see it freshen up things so, and sound so honest and bully.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the king begins to work his jaw again, and says how him and his\r\n      nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family\r\n      would take supper here with them this evening, and help set up with the\r\n      ashes of the diseased; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could\r\n      speak he knows who he would name, for they was names that was very dear to\r\n      him, and mentioned often in his letters; and so he will name the same, to\r\n      wit, as follows, vizz.:—Rev. Mr. Hobson, and Deacon Lot Hovey, and\r\n      Mr. Ben Rucker, and Abner Shackleford, and Levi Bell, and Dr. Robinson,\r\n      and their wives, and the widow Bartley.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting\r\n      together—that is, I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t’other\r\n      world, and the preacher was pinting him right. Lawyer Bell was away\r\n      up to Louisville on business. But the rest was on hand, and so they\r\n      all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him;\r\n      and then they shook hands with the duke and didn’t say nothing, but\r\n      just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads\r\n      whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said “Goo-goo—goo-goo-goo”\r\n      all the time, like a baby that can’t talk.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the king he blattered along, and managed to inquire about pretty much\r\n      everybody and dog in town, by his name, and mentioned all sorts of little\r\n      things that happened one time or another in the town, or to George’s\r\n      family, or to Peter. And he always let on that Peter wrote him the\r\n      things; but that was a lie: he got every blessed one of them out of\r\n      that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind, and the king\r\n      he read it out loud and cried over it. It give the dwelling-house\r\n      and three thousand dollars, gold, to the girls; and it give the tanyard\r\n      (which was doing a good business), along with some other houses and land\r\n      (worth about seven thousand), and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey\r\n      and William, and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar.\r\n      So these two frauds said they’d go and fetch it up, and have\r\n      everything square and above-board; and told me to come with a candle.\r\n      We shut the cellar door behind us, and when they found the bag they\r\n      spilt it out on the floor, and it was a lovely sight, all them\r\n      yaller-boys. My, the way the king’s eyes did shine! He\r\n      slaps the duke on the shoulder and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, <i>this</i> ain’t bully nor noth’n! Oh, no, I\r\n      reckon not! Why, <i>bully</i>, it beats the Nonesuch, <i>don’t</i>\r\n      it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke allowed it did. They pawed the yaller-boys, and sifted them\r\n      through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor; and the king\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t no use talkin’; bein’ brothers to a rich\r\n      dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that’s got left is the\r\n      line for you and me, Bilge. Thish yer comes of trust’n to\r\n      Providence. It’s the best way, in the long run. I’ve\r\n      tried ’em all, and ther’ ain’t no better way.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile, and took it on trust;\r\n      but no, they must count it. So they counts it, and it comes out four\r\n      hundred and fifteen dollars short. Says the king:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dern him, I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen\r\n      dollars?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They worried over that awhile, and ransacked all around for it. Then\r\n      the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, he was a pretty sick man, and likely he made a mistake—I\r\n      reckon that’s the way of it. The best way’s to let it\r\n      go, and keep still about it. We can spare it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, shucks, yes, we can <i>spare</i> it. I don’t k’yer\r\n      noth’n ’bout that—it’s the <i>count</i> I’m\r\n      thinkin’ about. We want to be awful square and open and\r\n      above-board here, you know. We want to lug this h-yer money up\r\n      stairs and count it before everybody—then ther’ ain’t\r\n      noth’n suspicious. But when the dead man says ther’s six\r\n      thous’n dollars, you know, we don’t want to—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on,” says the duke. “Le’s make up the\r\n      deffisit,” and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c25-215\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c25-215.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c25-215.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4125598369863138593\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a most amaz’n’ good idea, duke—you <i>have</i>\r\n      got a rattlin’ clever head on you,” says the king. “Blest\r\n      if the old Nonesuch ain’t a heppin’ us out agin,” and <i>he</i>\r\n      begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It most busted them, but they made up the six thousand clean and clear.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say,” says the duke, “I got another idea. Le’s\r\n      go up stairs and count this money, and then take and <i>give it to the\r\n      girls</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good land, duke, lemme hug you! It’s the most dazzling\r\n      idea ’at ever a man struck. You have cert’nly got the\r\n      most astonishin’ head I ever see. Oh, this is the boss dodge, ther’ \r\n      ain’t no mistake ’bout it. Let ’em fetch along\r\n      their suspicions now if they want to—this ’ll lay ’em\r\n      out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table, and the king he\r\n      counted it and stacked it up, three hundred dollars in a pile—twenty\r\n      elegant little piles. Everybody looked hungry at it, and licked\r\n      their chops. Then they raked it into the bag again, and I see the\r\n      king begin to swell himself up for another speech. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Friends all, my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by\r\n      them that’s left behind in the vale of sorrers. He has done\r\n      generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered, and\r\n      that’s left fatherless and motherless. Yes, and we that knowed\r\n      him knows that he would a done <i>more</i> generous by ’em if he\r\n      hadn’t ben afeard o’ woundin’ his dear William and me.\r\n      Now, <i>wouldn’t</i> he? Ther’ ain’t no\r\n      question ’bout it in <i>my</i> mind. Well, then, what kind o’ \r\n      brothers would it be that ’d stand in his way at sech a time? And\r\n      what kind o’ uncles would it be that ’d rob—yes, <i>rob</i>—sech\r\n      poor sweet lambs as these ’at he loved so at sech a time? If I\r\n      know William—and I <i>think</i> I do—he—well, I’ll\r\n      jest ask him.” He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to\r\n      the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and\r\n      leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\r\n      meaning, and jumps for the king, goo-gooing with all his might for joy,\r\n      and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up. Then the king\r\n      says, “I knowed it; I reckon <i>that ’ll</i> convince anybody\r\n      the way <i>he</i> feels about it. Here, Mary Jane, Susan, Joanner,\r\n      take the money—take it <i>all</i>. It’s the gift of him\r\n      that lays yonder, cold but joyful.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c25-216\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c25-216.jpg (55K)\" src=\"images/c25-216.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4830098534679071923\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Mary Jane she went for him, Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke, and\r\n      then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet. And everybody\r\n      crowded up with the tears in their eyes, and most shook the hands off of\r\n      them frauds, saying all the time:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You <i>dear</i> good souls!—how <i>lovely</i>!—how <i>could</i>\r\n      you!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, then, pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again,\r\n      and how good he was, and what a loss he was, and all that; and before long\r\n      a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside, and stood\r\n      a-listening and looking, and not saying anything; and nobody saying\r\n      anything to him either, because the king was talking and they was all busy\r\n      listening. The king was saying—in the middle of something he’d\r\n      started in on—\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “—they bein’ partickler friends o’ the diseased.\r\n      That’s why they’re invited here this evenin’; but\r\n      tomorrow we want <i>all</i> to come—everybody; for he respected\r\n      everybody, he liked everybody, and so it’s fitten that his funeral\r\n      orgies sh’d be public.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so he went a-mooning on and on, liking to hear himself talk, and every\r\n      little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again, till the duke he\r\n      couldn’t stand it no more; so he writes on a little scrap of paper,\r\n      “<i>Obsequies</i>, you old fool,” and folds it up, and goes to\r\n      goo-gooing and reaching it over people’s heads to him. The\r\n      king he reads it and puts it in his pocket, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Poor William, afflicted as he is, his <i>heart’s</i> aluz\r\n      right. Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral—wants\r\n      me to make ’em all welcome. But he needn’t a worried—it\r\n      was jest what I was at.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he weaves along again, perfectly ca’m, and goes to dropping in\r\n      his funeral orgies again every now and then, just like he done before.\r\n      And when he done it the third time he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I say orgies, not because it’s the common term, because it\r\n      ain’t—obsequies bein’ the common term—but because\r\n      orgies is the right term. Obsequies ain’t used in England no more\r\n      now—it’s gone out. We say orgies now in England. Orgies\r\n      is better, because it means the thing you’re after more exact.\r\n      It’s a word that’s made up out’n the Greek <i>orgo</i>,\r\n      outside, open, abroad; and the Hebrew <i>jeesum</i>, to plant, cover up;\r\n      hence in<i>ter.</i> So, you see, funeral orgies is an open er public\r\n      funeral.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was the <i>worst</i> I ever struck. Well, the iron-jawed man he\r\n      laughed right in his face. Everybody was shocked. Everybody\r\n      says, “Why, <i>doctor</i>!” and Abner Shackleford says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Robinson, hain’t you heard the news? This is\r\n      Harvey Wilks.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king he smiled eager, and shoved out his flapper, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Is it my poor brother’s dear good friend and physician?\r\n      I—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Keep your hands off of me!” says the doctor. “<i>You</i>\r\n      talk like an Englishman, <i>don’t</i> you? It’s the\r\n      worst imitation I ever heard. <i>You</i> Peter Wilks’s\r\n      brother! You’re a fraud, that’s what you are!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c25-218\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c25-218.jpg (35K)\" src=\"images/c25-218.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3083476764465591753\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, how they all took on! They crowded around the doctor and tried\r\n      to quiet him down, and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey\r\n      ’d showed in forty ways that he <i>was</i> Harvey, and knowed\r\n      everybody by name, and the names of the very dogs, and begged and <i>begged</i>\r\n      him not to hurt Harvey’s feelings and the poor girl’s\r\n      feelings, and all that. But it warn’t no use; he stormed right\r\n      along, and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and couldn’t\r\n      imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar.\r\n      The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying; and all of a\r\n      sudden the doctor ups and turns on <i>them</i>. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I was your father’s friend, and I’m your friend; and I\r\n      warn you as a friend, and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep\r\n      you out of harm and trouble, to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have\r\n      nothing to do with him, the ignorant tramp, with his idiotic Greek and\r\n      Hebrew, as he calls it. He is the thinnest kind of an impostor—has\r\n      come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up\r\n      somewheres, and you take them for <i>proofs</i>, and are helped to fool\r\n      yourselves by these foolish friends here, who ought to know better. Mary\r\n      Jane Wilks, you know me for your friend, and for your unselfish friend,\r\n      too. Now listen to me; turn this pitiful rascal out—I <i>beg</i>\r\n      you to do it. Will you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Mary Jane straightened herself up, and my, but she was handsome! She\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Here</i> is my answer.” She hove up the bag of money\r\n      and put it in the king’s hands, and says, “Take this six\r\n      thousand dollars, and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to,\r\n      and don’t give us no receipt for it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then she put her arm around the king on one side, and Susan and the\r\n      hare-lip done the same on the other. Everybody clapped their hands\r\n      and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm, whilst the king held up his\r\n      head and smiled proud. The doctor says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right; I wash <i>my</i> hands of the matter. But I warn\r\n      you all that a time ’s coming when you’re going to feel sick\r\n      whenever you think of this day.” And away he went.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, doctor,” says the king, kinder mocking him;\r\n      “we’ll try and get ’em to send for you;” which\r\n      made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c25-219\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c25-219.jpg (24K)\" src=\"images/c25-219.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4782423970841889231\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c26-220\"></a><br> <br>\r\n<a id=\"c26\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c26-220.jpg (168K)\" src=\"images/c26-220.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3280289513429246051\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off\r\n      for spare rooms, and she said she had one spare room, which would do for\r\n      Uncle William, and she’d give her own room to Uncle Harvey, which\r\n      was a little bigger, and she would turn into the room with her sisters and\r\n      sleep on a cot; and up garret was a little cubby, with a pallet in it. The\r\n      king said the cubby would do for his valley—meaning me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So Mary Jane took us up, and she showed them their rooms, which was plain\r\n      but nice. She said she’d have her frocks and a lot of other\r\n      traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey’s way, but he\r\n      said they warn’t. The frocks was hung along the wall, and\r\n      before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor.\r\n      There was an old hair trunk in one corner, and a guitar-box in\r\n      another, and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like\r\n      girls brisken up a room with. The king said it was all the more\r\n      homely and more pleasanter for these fixings, and so don’t disturb\r\n      them. The duke’s room was pretty small, but plenty good\r\n      enough, and so was my cubby.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That night they had a big supper, and all them men and women was there,\r\n      and I stood behind the king and the duke’s chairs and waited on\r\n      them, and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set at the\r\n      head of the table, with Susan alongside of her, and said how bad the\r\n      biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the\r\n      fried chickens was—and all that kind of rot, the way women always do\r\n      for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was\r\n      tiptop, and said so—said “How <i>do</i> you get biscuits to\r\n      brown so nice?” and “Where, for the land’s sake, <i>did</i>\r\n      you get these amaz’n pickles?” and all that kind of humbug\r\n      talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c26-221\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c26-221.jpg (54K)\" src=\"images/c26-221.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2447039124982969445\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off\r\n      of the leavings, whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the\r\n      things. The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England, and blest\r\n      if I didn’t think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes. She\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did you ever see the king?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who? William Fourth? Well, I bet I have—he goes\r\n      to our church.” I knowed he was dead years ago, but I never\r\n      let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What—regular?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes—regular. His pew’s right over opposite ourn—on\r\n      t’other side the pulpit.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I thought he lived in London?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, he does. Where <i>would</i> he live?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But I thought <i>you</i> lived in Sheffield?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see I was up a stump. I had to let on to get choked with a chicken\r\n      bone, so as to get time to think how to get down again. Then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I mean he goes to our church regular when he’s in Sheffield.\r\n      That’s only in the summer time, when he comes there to take\r\n      the sea baths.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, how you talk—Sheffield ain’t on the sea.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, who said it was?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, you did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I <i>didn’t</i> nuther.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You did!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I didn’t.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I never said nothing of the kind.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, what <i>did</i> you say, then?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Said he come to take the sea <i>baths</i>—that’s what I\r\n      said.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, how’s he going to take the sea baths if it ain’t\r\n      on the sea?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Looky here,” I says; “did you ever see any\r\n      Congress-water?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, did you have to go to Congress to get it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, no.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a\r\n      sea bath.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How does he get it, then?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water—in\r\n      barrels. There in the palace at Sheffield they’ve got\r\n      furnaces, and he wants his water hot. They can’t bile that\r\n      amount of water away off there at the sea. They haven’t got no\r\n      conveniences for it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, I see, now. You might a said that in the first place and\r\n      saved time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When she said that I see I was out of the woods again, and so I was\r\n      comfortable and glad. Next, she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Do you go to church, too?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes—regular.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Where do you set?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, in our pew.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Whose</i> pew?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, <i>ourn</i>—your Uncle Harvey’s.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “His’n? What does <i>he</i> want with a pew?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Wants it to set in. What did you <i>reckon</i> he wanted with\r\n      it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, I thought he’d be in the pulpit.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Rot him, I forgot he was a preacher. I see I was up a stump again,\r\n      so I played another chicken bone and got another think. Then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blame it, do you suppose there ain’t but one preacher to a\r\n      church?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, what do they want with more?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What!—to preach before a king? I never did see such a\r\n      girl as you. They don’t have no less than seventeen.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Seventeen! My land! Why, I wouldn’t set out such\r\n      a string as that, not if I <i>never</i> got to glory. It must take\r\n      ’em a week.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks, they don’t <i>all</i> of ’em preach the same\r\n      day—only <i>one</i> of ’em.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what does the rest of ’em do?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, nothing much. Loll around, pass the plate—and one\r\n      thing or another. But mainly they don’t do nothing.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what are they <i>for</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, they’re for <i>style</i>. Don’t you know\r\n      nothing?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I don’t <i>want</i> to know no such foolishness as\r\n      that. How is servants treated in England? Do they treat\r\n      ’em better ’n we treat our niggers?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>No</i>! A servant ain’t nobody there. They\r\n      treat them worse than dogs.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t they give ’em holidays, the way we do, Christmas\r\n      and New Year’s week, and Fourth of July?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, just listen! A body could tell <i>you</i> hain’t\r\n      ever been to England by that. Why, Hare-l—why, Joanna, they\r\n      never see a holiday from year’s end to year’s end; never go to\r\n      the circus, nor theater, nor nigger shows, nor nowheres.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Nor church?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Nor church.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But <i>you</i> always went to church.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I was gone up again. I forgot I was the old man’s\r\n      servant. But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation\r\n      how a valley was different from a common servant and <i>had</i> to go to\r\n      church whether he wanted to or not, and set with the family, on account of\r\n      its being the law. But I didn’t do it pretty good, and when I\r\n      got done I see she warn’t satisfied. She says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honest injun, now, hain’t you been telling me a lot of lies?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c26-224\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c26-224.jpg (63K)\" src=\"images/c26-224.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3853813928519124793\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honest injun,” says I.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “None of it at all?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “None of it at all. Not a lie in it,” says I.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Lay your hand on this book and say it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see it warn’t nothing but a dictionary, so I laid my hand on it\r\n      and said it. So then she looked a little better satisfied, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, I’ll believe some of it; but I hope to gracious\r\n      if I’ll believe the rest.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What is it you won’t believe, Joe?” says Mary Jane,\r\n      stepping in with Susan behind her. “It ain’t right nor kind\r\n      for you to talk so to him, and him a stranger and so far from his people.\r\n      How would you like to be treated so?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That’s always your way, Maim—always sailing in to help\r\n      somebody before they’re hurt. I hain’t done nothing to\r\n      him. He’s told some stretchers, I reckon, and I said I wouldn’t\r\n      swallow it all; and that’s every bit and grain I <i>did</i> say.\r\n      I reckon he can stand a little thing like that, can’t he?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t care whether ’twas little or whether ’twas\r\n      big; he’s here in our house and a stranger, and it wasn’t good\r\n      of you to say it. If you was in his place it would make you feel\r\n      ashamed; and so you oughtn’t to say a thing to another person that\r\n      will make <i>them</i> feel ashamed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Mam, he said—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It don’t make no difference what he <i>said</i>—that\r\n      ain’t the thing. The thing is for you to treat him <i>kind</i>,\r\n      and not be saying things to make him remember he ain’t in his own\r\n      country and amongst his own folks.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says to myself, <i>this</i> is a girl that I’m letting that old\r\n      reptile rob her of her money!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then Susan <i>she</i> waltzed in; and if you’ll believe me, she did\r\n      give Hare-lip hark from the tomb!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says I to myself, and this is <i>another</i> one that I’m letting\r\n      him rob her of her money!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then Mary Jane she took another inning, and went in sweet and lovely again—which\r\n      was her way; but when she got done there warn’t hardly anything left\r\n      o’ poor Hare-lip. So she hollered.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, then,” says the other girls; “you just ask\r\n      his pardon.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She done it, too; and she done it beautiful. She done it so\r\n      beautiful it was good to hear; and I wished I could tell her a thousand\r\n      lies, so she could do it again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says to myself, this is <i>another</i> one that I’m letting him\r\n      rob her of her money. And when she got through they all jest laid\r\n      theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends.\r\n      I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself, my\r\n      mind’s made up; I’ll hive that money for them or bust.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So then I lit out—for bed, I said, meaning some time or another.\r\n      When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over. I says\r\n      to myself, shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?\r\n      No—that won’t do. He might tell who told him; then the\r\n      king and the duke would make it warm for me. Shall I go, private,\r\n      and tell Mary Jane? No—I dasn’t do it. Her face would\r\n      give them a hint, sure; they’ve got the money, and they’d\r\n      slide right out and get away with it. If she was to fetch in help I’d\r\n      get mixed up in the business before it was done with, I judge. No;\r\n      there ain’t no good way but one. I got to steal that money,\r\n      somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won’t suspicion\r\n      that I done it. They’ve got a good thing here, and they ain’t\r\n      a-going to leave till they’ve played this family and this town for\r\n      all they’re worth, so I’ll find a chance time enough. I’ll\r\n      steal it and hide it; and by and by, when I’m away down the river, I’ll\r\n      write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it’s hid. But I better\r\n      hive it tonight if I can, because the doctor maybe hasn’t let up as\r\n      much as he lets on he has; he might scare them out of here yet.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So, thinks I, I’ll go and search them rooms. Upstairs the hall\r\n      was dark, but I found the duke’s room, and started to paw around it\r\n      with my hands; but I recollected it wouldn’t be much like the king\r\n      to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I\r\n      went to his room and begun to paw around there. But I see I couldn’t\r\n      do nothing without a candle, and I dasn’t light one, of course.\r\n      So I judged I’d got to do the other thing—lay for them\r\n      and eavesdrop. About that time I hears their footsteps coming, and\r\n      was going to skip under the bed; I reached for it, but it wasn’t\r\n      where I thought it would be; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane’s\r\n      frocks, so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns, and\r\n      stood there perfectly still.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c26-226\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c26-226.jpg (73K)\" src=\"images/c26-226.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3028664528093228979\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\r\n      get down and look under the bed. Then I was glad I hadn’t\r\n      found the bed when I wanted it. And yet, you know, it’s kind\r\n      of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private.\r\n      They sets down then, and the king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, what is it? And cut it middlin’ short, because it’s\r\n      better for us to be down there a-whoopin’ up the mournin’ than\r\n      up here givin’ ’em a chance to talk us over.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, this is it, Capet. I ain’t easy; I ain’t\r\n      comfortable. That doctor lays on my mind. I wanted to know\r\n      your plans. I’ve got a notion, and I think it’s a sound\r\n      one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What is it, duke?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That we better glide out of this before three in the morning, and\r\n      clip it down the river with what we’ve got. Specially, seeing\r\n      we got it so easy—<i>given</i> back to us, flung at our heads, as\r\n      you may say, when of course we allowed to have to steal it back. I’m\r\n      for knocking off and lighting out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That made me feel pretty bad. About an hour or two ago it would a\r\n      been a little different, but now it made me feel bad and disappointed, The\r\n      king rips out and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What! And not sell out the rest o’ the property? March\r\n      off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous’n’ \r\n      dollars’ worth o’ property layin’ around jest sufferin’ \r\n      to be scooped in?—and all good, salable stuff, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke he grumbled; said the bag of gold was enough, and he didn’t\r\n      want to go no deeper—didn’t want to rob a lot of orphans of <i>everything</i>\r\n      they had.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, how you talk!” says the king. “We sha’n’t\r\n      rob ’em of nothing at all but jest this money. The people that\r\n      <i>buys</i> the property is the suff’rers; because as soon ’s\r\n      it’s found out ’at we didn’t own it—which won’t\r\n      be long after we’ve slid—the sale won’t be valid, and it\r\n      ’ll all go back to the estate. These yer orphans ’ll git\r\n      their house back agin, and that’s enough for <i>them</i>; they’re\r\n      young and spry, and k’n easy earn a livin’. <i>they</i>\r\n      ain’t a-goin to suffer. Why, jest think—there’s\r\n      thous’n’s and thous’n’s that ain’t nigh so\r\n      well off. Bless you, <i>they</i> ain’t got noth’n’ \r\n      to complain of.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the king he talked him blind; so at last he give in, and said all\r\n      right, but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay, and that\r\n      doctor hanging over them. But the king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cuss the doctor! What do we k’yer for <i>him</i>?\r\n      Hain’t we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain’t\r\n      that a big enough majority in any town?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they got ready to go down stairs again. The duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t think we put that money in a good place.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That cheered me up. I’d begun to think I warn’t going to\r\n      get a hint of no kind to help me. The king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Because Mary Jane ’ll be in mourning from this out; and first\r\n      you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these\r\n      duds up and put ’em away; and do you reckon a nigger can run across\r\n      money and not borrow some of it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Your head’s level agin, duke,” says the king; and he\r\n      comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was.\r\n      I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still, though quivery; and\r\n      I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me; and I\r\n      tried to think what I’d better do if they did catch me. But\r\n      the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a\r\n      thought, and he never suspicioned I was around. They took and shoved\r\n      the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed,\r\n      and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all\r\n      right now, because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed, and don’t\r\n      turn over the straw tick only about twice a year, and so it warn’t\r\n      in no danger of getting stole now.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c26-229\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c26-229.jpg (72K)\" src=\"images/c26-229.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1625162725403632612\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But I knowed better. I had it out of there before they was half-way\r\n      down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I\r\n      could get a chance to do better. I judged I better hide it outside\r\n      of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the\r\n      house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I\r\n      turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn’t a gone to sleep if\r\n      I’d a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the\r\n      business. By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so I\r\n      rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder, and\r\n      waited to see if anything was going to happen. But nothing did.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn’t\r\n      begun yet; and then I slipped down the ladder.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c27-230\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c27\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c27-230.jpg (153K)\" src=\"images/c27-230.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6719655360102972914\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I crept to their doors and listened; they was snoring. So I tiptoed\r\n      along, and got down stairs all right. There warn’t a sound\r\n      anywheres. I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door, and see\r\n      the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs.\r\n      The door was open into the parlor, where the corpse was laying, and\r\n      there was a candle in both rooms. I passed along, and the parlor door was\r\n      open; but I see there warn’t nobody in there but the remainders of\r\n      Peter; so I shoved on by; but the front door was locked, and the key wasn’t\r\n      there. Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs, back\r\n      behind me. I run in the parlor and took a swift look around, and the\r\n      only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin. The lid was\r\n      shoved along about a foot, showing the dead man’s face down in\r\n      there, with a wet cloth over it, and his shroud on. I tucked the\r\n      money-bag in under the lid, just down beyond where his hands was crossed,\r\n      which made me creep, they was so cold, and then I run back across the room\r\n      and in behind the door.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The person coming was Mary Jane. She went to the coffin, very soft,\r\n      and kneeled down and looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I\r\n      see she begun to cry, though I couldn’t hear her, and her back was\r\n      to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I’d\r\n      make sure them watchers hadn’t seen me; so I looked through the\r\n      crack, and everything was all right. They hadn’t stirred.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I slipped up to bed, feeling ruther blue, on accounts of the thing playing\r\n      out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about\r\n      it. Says I, if it could stay where it is, all right; because when we\r\n      get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane,\r\n      and she could dig him up again and get it; but that ain’t the thing\r\n      that’s going to happen; the thing that’s going to happen is,\r\n      the money ’ll be found when they come to screw on the lid. Then\r\n      the king ’ll get it again, and it ’ll be a long day before he\r\n      gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him. Of course I <i>wanted</i>\r\n      to slide down and get it out of there, but I dasn’t try it. Every\r\n      minute it was getting earlier now, and pretty soon some of them watchers\r\n      would begin to stir, and I might get catched—catched with six\r\n      thousand dollars in my hands that nobody hadn’t hired me to take\r\n      care of. I don’t wish to be mixed up in no such business as\r\n      that, I says to myself.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up, and the\r\n      watchers was gone. There warn’t nobody around but the family\r\n      and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if\r\n      anything had been happening, but I couldn’t tell.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man, and they\r\n      set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs, and then\r\n      set all our chairs in rows, and borrowed more from the neighbors till the\r\n      hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full. I see the coffin\r\n      lid was the way it was before, but I dasn’t go to look in under it,\r\n      with folks around.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the people begun to flock in, and the beats and the girls took seats\r\n      in the front row at the head of the coffin, and for a half an hour the\r\n      people filed around slow, in single rank, and looked down at the dead man’s\r\n      face a minute, and some dropped in a tear, and it was all very still and\r\n      solemn, only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes\r\n      and keeping their heads bent, and sobbing a little. There warn’t\r\n      no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses—because\r\n      people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places\r\n      except church.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black\r\n      gloves with his softy soothering ways, putting on the last touches, and\r\n      getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable, and making no\r\n      more sound than a cat. He never spoke; he moved people around, he\r\n      squeezed in late ones, he opened up passageways, and done it with nods,\r\n      and signs with his hands. Then he took his place over against the\r\n      wall. He was the softest, glidingest, stealthiest man I ever see; and\r\n      there warn’t no more smile to him than there is to a ham.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c27-232\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c27-232.jpg (31K)\" src=\"images/c27-232.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-576599941708480850\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They had borrowed a melodeum—a sick one; and when everything was\r\n      ready a young woman set down and worked it, and it was pretty skreeky and\r\n      colicky, and everybody joined in and sung, and Peter was the only one that\r\n      had a good thing, according to my notion. Then the Reverend Hobson\r\n      opened up, slow and solemn, and begun to talk; and straight off the most\r\n      outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard; it was only one\r\n      dog, but he made a most powerful racket, and he kept it up right along;\r\n      the parson he had to stand there, over the coffin, and wait—you\r\n      couldn’t hear yourself think. It was right down awkward, and\r\n      nobody didn’t seem to know what to do. But pretty soon they\r\n      see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to\r\n      say, “Don’t you worry—just depend on me.” Then\r\n      he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall, just his shoulders\r\n      showing over the people’s heads. So he glided along, and the\r\n      powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time; and at\r\n      last, when he had gone around two sides of the room, he disappears down\r\n      cellar. Then in about two seconds we heard a whack, and the dog he\r\n      finished up with a most amazing howl or two, and then everything was dead\r\n      still, and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off. In a\r\n      minute or two here comes this undertaker’s back and shoulders\r\n      gliding along the wall again; and so he glided and glided around three\r\n      sides of the room, and then rose up, and shaded his mouth with his hands,\r\n      and stretched his neck out towards the preacher, over the people’s\r\n      heads, and says, in a kind of a coarse whisper, “<i>He had a rat</i>!”\r\n      Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place.\r\n      You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people, because\r\n      naturally they wanted to know. A little thing like that don’t\r\n      cost nothing, and it’s just the little things that makes a man to be\r\n      looked up to and liked. There warn’t no more popular man in\r\n      town than what that undertaker was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c27-233\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c27-233.jpg (48K)\" src=\"images/c27-233.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4718423729036967470\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, the funeral sermon was very good, but pison long and tiresome; and\r\n      then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage, and at\r\n      last the job was through, and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the\r\n      coffin with his screw-driver. I was in a sweat then, and watched him\r\n      pretty keen. But he never meddled at all; just slid the lid along as soft\r\n      as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast. So there I was! I\r\n      didn’t know whether the money was in there or not. So, says I,\r\n      s’pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly?—now how do I\r\n      know whether to write to Mary Jane or not? S’pose she dug him up and\r\n      didn’t find nothing, what would she think of me? Blame it, I says, I\r\n      might get hunted up and jailed; I’d better lay low and keep dark,\r\n      and not write at all; the thing’s awful mixed now; trying to better\r\n      it, I’ve worsened it a hundred times, and I wish to goodness I’d\r\n      just let it alone, dad fetch the whole business!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They buried him, and we come back home, and I went to watching faces again—I\r\n      couldn’t help it, and I couldn’t rest easy. But nothing\r\n      come of it; the faces didn’t tell me nothing.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king he visited around in the evening, and sweetened everybody up, and\r\n      made himself ever so friendly; and he give out the idea that his\r\n      congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him, so he must\r\n      hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home. He was\r\n      very sorry he was so pushed, and so was everybody; they wished he could\r\n      stay longer, but they said they could see it couldn’t be done.\r\n      And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with\r\n      them; and that pleased everybody too, because then the girls would be well\r\n      fixed and amongst their own relations; and it pleased the girls, too—tickled\r\n      them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world; and told\r\n      him to sell out as quick as he wanted to, they would be ready. Them\r\n      poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them\r\n      getting fooled and lied to so, but I didn’t see no safe way for me\r\n      to chip in and change the general tune.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, blamed if the king didn’t bill the house and the niggers and\r\n      all the property for auction straight off—sale two days after the\r\n      funeral; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the next day after the funeral, along about noon-time, the girls’ \r\n      joy got the first jolt. A couple of nigger traders come along, and\r\n      the king sold them the niggers reasonable, for three-day drafts as they\r\n      called it, and away they went, the two sons up the river to Memphis, and\r\n      their mother down the river to Orleans. I thought them poor girls\r\n      and them niggers would break their hearts for grief; they cried around\r\n      each other, and took on so it most made me down sick to see it. The\r\n      girls said they hadn’t ever dreamed of seeing the family separated\r\n      or sold away from the town. I can’t ever get it out of my\r\n      memory, the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around\r\n      each other’s necks and crying; and I reckon I couldn’t a stood\r\n      it all, but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I hadn’t\r\n      knowed the sale warn’t no account and the niggers would be back home\r\n      in a week or two.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The thing made a big stir in the town, too, and a good many come out\r\n      flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the\r\n      children that way. It injured the frauds some; but the old fool he\r\n      bulled right along, spite of all the duke could say or do, and I tell you\r\n      the duke was powerful uneasy.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next day was auction day. About broad day in the morning the king\r\n      and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up, and I see by their look\r\n      that there was trouble. The king says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Was you in my room night before last?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, your majesty”—which was the way I always called him\r\n      when nobody but our gang warn’t around.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c27-235\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c27-235.jpg (75K)\" src=\"images/c27-235.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7134052449025083277\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Was you in there yisterday er last night?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, your majesty.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honor bright, now—no lies.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honor bright, your majesty, I’m telling you the truth. I\r\n      hain’t been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the\r\n      duke and showed it to you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Have you seen anybody else go in there?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, your grace, not as I remember, I believe.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Stop and think.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I studied awhile and see my chance; then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I see the niggers go in there several times.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Both of them gave a little jump, and looked like they hadn’t ever\r\n      expected it, and then like they <i>had</i>. Then the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What, all of them?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No—leastways, not all at once—that is, I don’t\r\n      think I ever see them all come <i>out</i> at once but just one time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello! When was that?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It was the day we had the funeral. In the morning. It\r\n      warn’t early, because I overslept. I was just starting down\r\n      the ladder, and I see them.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, go on, <i>go</i> on! What did they do? How’d\r\n      they act?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “They didn’t do nothing. And they didn’t act\r\n      anyway much, as fur as I see. They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough,\r\n      that they’d shoved in there to do up your majesty’s room, or\r\n      something, s’posing you was up; and found you <i>warn’t</i>\r\n      up, and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without\r\n      waking you up, if they hadn’t already waked you up.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Great guns, <i>this</i> is a go!” says the king; and both of\r\n      them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly. They stood there\r\n      a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute, and the duke he bust into\r\n      a kind of a little raspy chuckle, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand. They\r\n      let on to be <i>sorry</i> they was going out of this region! And I\r\n      believed they <i>was</i> sorry, and so did you, and so did everybody.\r\n      Don’t ever tell <i>me</i> any more that a nigger ain’t\r\n      got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it\r\n      would fool <i>anybody</i>. In my opinion, there’s a fortune in\r\n      ’em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn’t want a\r\n      better lay-out than that—and here we’ve gone and sold ’em\r\n      for a song. Yes, and ain’t privileged to sing the song yet.\r\n      Say, where <i>is</i> that song—that draft?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “In the bank for to be collected. Where <i>would</i> it be?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, <i>that’s</i> all right then, thank goodness.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says I, kind of timid-like:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Is something gone wrong?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king whirls on me and rips out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “None o’ your business! You keep your head shet, and\r\n      mind y’r own affairs—if you got any. Long as you’re\r\n      in this town don’t you forgit <i>that</i>—you hear?”\r\n      Then he says to the duke, “We got to jest swaller it and say\r\n      noth’n’: mum’s the word for <i>us</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Quick sales <i>and</i> small profits! It’s a good\r\n      business—yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c27-237\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c27-237.jpg (38K)\" src=\"images/c27-237.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8138230559009813308\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king snarls around on him and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I was trying to do for the best in sellin’ ’em out so\r\n      quick. If the profits has turned out to be none, lackin’ \r\n      considable, and none to carry, is it my fault any more’n it’s\r\n      yourn?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, <i>they’d</i> be in this house yet and we <i>wouldn’t</i>\r\n      if I could a got my advice listened to.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king sassed back as much as was safe for him, and then swapped around\r\n      and lit into <i>me</i> again. He give me down the banks for not\r\n      coming and <i>telling</i> him I see the niggers come out of his room\r\n      acting that way—said any fool would a <i>knowed</i> something was\r\n      up. And then waltzed in and cussed <i>himself</i> awhile, and said\r\n      it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that\r\n      morning, and he’d be blamed if he’d ever do it again. So\r\n      they went off a-jawing; and I felt dreadful glad I’d worked it all\r\n      off on to the niggers, and yet hadn’t done the niggers no harm by\r\n      it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c28-239\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c28\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c28-239.jpg (155K)\" src=\"images/c28-239.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5405160458310822504\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By and by it was getting-up time. So I come down the ladder and\r\n      started for down-stairs; but as I come to the girls’ room the door\r\n      was open, and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk, which was\r\n      open and she’d been packing things in it—getting ready to go\r\n      to England. But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap,\r\n      and had her face in her hands, crying. I felt awful bad to see it;\r\n      of course anybody would. I went in there and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Miss Mary Jane, you can’t a-bear to see people in trouble,\r\n      and I can’t—most always. Tell me about it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So she done it. And it was the niggers—I just expected it.\r\n      She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for\r\n      her; she didn’t know <i>how</i> she was ever going to be happy\r\n      there, knowing the mother and the children warn’t ever going to see\r\n      each other no more—and then busted out bitterer than ever, and flung\r\n      up her hands, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, dear, dear, to think they ain’t <i>ever</i> going to see\r\n      each other any more!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But they <i>will</i>—and inside of two weeks—and I <i>know</i>\r\n      it!” says I.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Laws, it was out before I could think! And before I could budge she\r\n      throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it <i>again</i>, say it\r\n      <i>again</i>, say it <i>again</i>!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close place.\r\n      I asked her to let me think a minute; and she set there, very impatient\r\n      and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and eased-up, like a\r\n      person that’s had a tooth pulled out. So I went to studying it\r\n      out. I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth\r\n      when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks, though I\r\n      ain’t had no experience, and can’t say for certain; but it\r\n      looks so to me, anyway; and yet here’s a case where I’m blest\r\n      if it don’t look to me like the truth is better and actuly <i>safer</i>\r\n      than a lie. I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time\r\n      or other, it’s so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing\r\n      like it. Well, I says to myself at last, I’m a-going to chance\r\n      it; I’ll up and tell the truth this time, though it does seem most\r\n      like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where\r\n      you’ll go to. Then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where\r\n      you could go and stay three or four days?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes; Mr. Lothrop’s. Why?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Never mind why yet. If I’ll tell you how I know the\r\n      niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks—here in this\r\n      house—and <i>prove</i> how I know it—will you go to Mr.\r\n      Lothrop’s and stay four days?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Four days!” she says; “I’ll stay a year!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right,” I says, “I don’t want nothing more\r\n      out of <i>you</i> than just your word—I druther have it than another\r\n      man’s kiss-the-Bible.” She smiled and reddened up very\r\n      sweet, and I says, “If you don’t mind it, I’ll shut the\r\n      door—and bolt it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I come back and set down again, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you holler. Just set still and take it like a\r\n      man. I got to tell the truth, and you want to brace up, Miss Mary,\r\n      because it’s a bad kind, and going to be hard to take, but there ain’t\r\n      no help for it. These uncles of yourn ain’t no uncles at all;\r\n      they’re a couple of frauds—regular dead-beats. There,\r\n      now we’re over the worst of it, you can stand the rest middling\r\n      easy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It jolted her up like everything, of course; but I was over the shoal\r\n      water now, so I went right along, her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all\r\n      the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck that\r\n      young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she flung\r\n      herself on to the king’s breast at the front door and he kissed her\r\n      sixteen or seventeen times—and then up she jumps, with her face\r\n      afire like sunset, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The brute! Come, don’t waste a minute—not a <i>second</i>—we’ll\r\n      have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c28-241\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c28-241.jpg (34K)\" src=\"images/c28-241.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6303984991438187529\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says I:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cert’nly. But do you mean <i>before</i> you go to Mr.\r\n      Lothrop’s, or—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh,” she says, “what am I <i>thinking</i> about!”\r\n      she says, and set right down again. “Don’t mind what I said—please\r\n      don’t—you <i>won’t,</i> now, <i>will</i> you?”\r\n      Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would\r\n      die first. “I never thought, I was so stirred up,” she says;\r\n      “now go on, and I won’t do so any more. You tell me what\r\n      to do, and whatever you say I’ll do it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” I says, “it’s a rough gang, them two\r\n      frauds, and I’m fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer,\r\n      whether I want to or not—I druther not tell you why; and if you was\r\n      to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws, and I’d\r\n      be all right; but there’d be another person that you don’t\r\n      know about who’d be in big trouble. Well, we got to save <i>him</i>,\r\n      hain’t we? Of course. Well, then, we won’t blow on\r\n      them.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Saying them words put a good idea in my head. I see how maybe I\r\n      could get me and Jim rid of the frauds; get them jailed here, and then\r\n      leave. But I didn’t want to run the raft in the daytime without\r\n      anybody aboard to answer questions but me; so I didn’t want the plan\r\n      to begin working till pretty late to-night. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Miss Mary Jane, I’ll tell you what we’ll do, and you\r\n      won’t have to stay at Mr. Lothrop’s so long, nuther. How\r\n      fur is it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A little short of four miles—right out in the country, back\r\n      here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, that ’ll answer. Now you go along out there, and\r\n      lay low till nine or half-past to-night, and then get them to fetch you\r\n      home again—tell them you’ve thought of something. If you\r\n      get here before eleven put a candle in this window, and if I don’t\r\n      turn up wait <i>till</i> eleven, and <i>then</i> if I don’t turn up\r\n      it means I’m gone, and out of the way, and safe. Then you come out\r\n      and spread the news around, and get these beats jailed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good,” she says, “I’ll do it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “And if it just happens so that I don’t get away, but get took\r\n      up along with them, you must up and say I told you the whole thing\r\n      beforehand, and you must stand by me all you can.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Stand by you! indeed I will. They sha’n’t touch a\r\n      hair of your head!” she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her\r\n      eyes snap when she said it, too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If I get away I sha’n’t be here,” I says, “to\r\n      prove these rapscallions ain’t your uncles, and I couldn’t do\r\n      it if I <i>was</i> here. I could swear they was beats and bummers,\r\n      that’s all, though that’s worth something. Well, there’s\r\n      others can do that better than what I can, and they’re people that\r\n      ain’t going to be doubted as quick as I’d be. I’ll\r\n      tell you how to find them. Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.\r\n      There—‘Royal Nonesuch, Bricksville.’ Put it\r\n      away, and don’t lose it. When the court wants to find out\r\n      something about these two, let them send up to Bricksville and say they’ve\r\n      got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch, and ask for some witnesses—why,\r\n      you’ll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink,\r\n      Miss Mary. And they’ll come a-biling, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c28-242\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c28-242.jpg (27K)\" src=\"images/c28-242.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-498428874956920785\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I judged we had got everything fixed about right now. So I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Just let the auction go right along, and don’t worry. Nobody\r\n      don’t have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the\r\n      auction on accounts of the short notice, and they ain’t going out of\r\n      this till they get that money; and the way we’ve fixed it the sale\r\n      ain’t going to count, and they ain’t going to get no money.\r\n      It’s just like the way it was with the niggers—it warn’t\r\n      no sale, and the niggers will be back before long. Why, they can’t\r\n      collect the money for the <i>niggers</i> yet—they’re in the\r\n      worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” she says, “I’ll run down to breakfast now,\r\n      and then I’ll start straight for Mr. Lothrop’s.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “’Deed, <i>that</i> ain’t the ticket, Miss Mary Jane,”\r\n      I says, “by no manner of means; go <i>before</i> breakfast.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I never thought—and come to think, I don’t know.\r\n      What was it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, it’s because you ain’t one of these leather-face\r\n      people. I don’t want no better book than what your face is.\r\n      A body can set down and read it off like coarse print. Do you\r\n      reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you\r\n      good-morning, and never—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “There, there, don’t! Yes, I’ll go before\r\n      breakfast—I’ll be glad to. And leave my sisters with them?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes; never mind about them. They’ve got to stand it yet\r\n      a while. They might suspicion something if all of you was to go.\r\n      I don’t want you to see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in\r\n      this town; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your\r\n      face would tell something. No, you go right along, Miss Mary Jane,\r\n      and I’ll fix it with all of them. I’ll tell Miss Susan to give\r\n      your love to your uncles and say you’ve went away for a few hours\r\n      for to get a little rest and change, or to see a friend, and you’ll\r\n      be back to-night or early in the morning.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won’t have my love\r\n      given to them.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, it sha’n’t be.” It was well\r\n      enough to tell <i>her</i> so—no harm in it. It was only a\r\n      little thing to do, and no trouble; and it’s the little things that\r\n      smooths people’s roads the most, down here below; it would make Mary\r\n      Jane comfortable, and it wouldn’t cost nothing. Then I says:\r\n      “There’s one more thing—that bag of money.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, they’ve got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to\r\n      think <i>how</i> they got it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, you’re out, there. They hain’t got it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, who’s got it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I wish I knowed, but I don’t. I <i>had</i> it, because\r\n      I stole it from them; and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I\r\n      hid it, but I’m afraid it ain’t there no more. I’m\r\n      awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I’m just as sorry as I can be; but I\r\n      done the best I could; I did honest. I come nigh getting caught, and\r\n      I had to shove it into the first place I come to, and run—and it\r\n      warn’t a good place.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, stop blaming yourself—it’s too bad to do it, and I\r\n      won’t allow it—you couldn’t help it; it wasn’t\r\n      your fault. Where did you hide it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I\r\n      couldn’t seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see\r\n      that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.\r\n      So for a minute I didn’t say nothing; then I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’d ruther not <i>tell</i> you where I put it, Miss Mary\r\n      Jane, if you don’t mind letting me off; but I’ll write it for\r\n      you on a piece of paper, and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop’s,\r\n      if you want to. Do you reckon that ’ll do?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I wrote: “I put it in the coffin. It was in there when you\r\n      was crying there, away in the night. I was behind the door, and I\r\n      was mighty sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c28-244\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c28-244.jpg (25K)\" src=\"images/c28-244.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8281861378141702712\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself\r\n      in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own roof,\r\n      shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to her I\r\n      see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the hand, hard,\r\n      and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Good</i>-bye. I’m going to do everything just as you’ve\r\n      told me; and if I don’t ever see you again, I sha’n’t\r\n      ever forget you and I’ll think of you a many and a many a time, and\r\n      I’ll <i>pray</i> for you, too!”—and she was gone.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Pray for me! I reckoned if she knowed me she’d take a job that\r\n      was more nearer her size. But I bet she done it, just the same—she\r\n      was just that kind. She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took\r\n      the notion—there warn’t no back-down to her, I judge. You\r\n      may say what you want to, but in my opinion she had more sand in her than\r\n      any girl I ever see; in my opinion she was just full of sand. It\r\n      sounds like flattery, but it ain’t no flattery. And when it\r\n      comes to beauty—and goodness, too—she lays over them all.\r\n      I hain’t ever seen her since that time that I see her go out\r\n      of that door; no, I hain’t ever seen her since, but I reckon I’ve\r\n      thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she\r\n      would pray for me; and if ever I’d a thought it would do any good\r\n      for me to pray for <i>her</i>, blamed if I wouldn’t a done it or\r\n      bust.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see her\r\n      go. When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s the name of them people over on t’other side of\r\n      the river that you all goes to see sometimes?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “There’s several; but it’s the Proctors, mainly.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That’s the name,” I says; “I most forgot it.\r\n      Well, Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she’s gone over\r\n      there in a dreadful hurry—one of them’s sick.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Which one?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it’s—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Sakes alive, I hope it ain’t <i>Hanner</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m sorry to say it,” I says, “but Hanner’s\r\n      the very one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “My goodness, and she so well only last week! Is she took bad?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t no name for it. They set up with her all\r\n      night, Miss Mary Jane said, and they don’t think she’ll last\r\n      many hours.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Only think of that, now! What’s the matter with her?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I couldn’t think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mumps.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mumps your granny!

And ther’ \r\n      ain’t no sense in <i>this</i>, nuther. Is it ketching?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Is it <i>ketching</i>? Why, how you talk. Is a <i>harrow</i>\r\n      catching—in the dark? If you don’t hitch on to one tooth, you’re\r\n      bound to on another, ain’t you? And you can’t get away with\r\n      that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along, can you? Well,\r\n      these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow, as you may say—and it ain’t\r\n      no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it’s awful, I think,” says the hare-lip. “I’ll\r\n      go to Uncle Harvey and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, yes,” I says, “I <i>would</i>. Of <i>course</i>\r\n      I would. I wouldn’t lose no time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, why wouldn’t you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.

So fur, so good. Your uncle Harvey’s a preacher,\r\n      ain’t he? Very well, then; is a <i>preacher</i> going to\r\n      deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a <i>ship clerk?</i>—so\r\n      as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard? Now <i>you</i> know\r\n      he ain’t. What <i>will</i> he do, then? Why, he’ll\r\n      say, ‘It’s a great pity, but my church matters has got to get\r\n      along the best way they can; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful\r\n      pluribus-unum mumps, and so it’s my bounden duty to set down here\r\n      and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she’s got it.’ \r\n      But never mind, if you think it’s best to tell your uncle\r\n      Harvey—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having\r\n      good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane’s\r\n      got it or not? Why, you talk like a muggins.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, anyway, maybe you’d better tell some of the neighbors.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Listen at that, now. You do beat all for natural stupidness.\r\n      Can’t you <i>see</i> that <i>they’d</i> go and tell?\r\n      Ther’ ain’t no way but just to not tell anybody at <i>all</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, maybe you’re right—yes, I judge you <i>are</i>\r\n      right.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she’s gone out a\r\n      while, anyway, so he won’t be uneasy about her?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that. She says,\r\n      ‘Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and\r\n      say I’ve run over the river to see Mr.’—Mr.—what\r\n      <i>is</i> the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so\r\n      much of?—I mean the one that—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain’t it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can’t ever seem\r\n      to remember them, half the time, somehow. Yes, she said, say she has\r\n      run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and\r\n      buy this house, because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had\r\n      it than anybody else; and she’s going to stick to them till they say\r\n      they’ll come, and then, if she ain’t too tired, she’s\r\n      coming home; and if she is, she’ll be home in the morning anyway.\r\n      She said, don’t say nothing about the Proctors, but only about\r\n      the Apthorps—which ’ll be perfectly true, because she is going\r\n      there to speak about their buying the house; I know it, because she told\r\n      me so herself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right,” they said, and cleared out to lay for their\r\n      uncles, and give them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Everything was all right now. The girls wouldn’t say nothing\r\n      because they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would\r\n      ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of\r\n      Doctor Robinson. I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty\r\n      neat—I reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn’t a done it no neater\r\n      himself. Of course he would a throwed more style into it, but I can’t\r\n      do that very handy, not being brung up to it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end of\r\n      the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man he\r\n      was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the\r\n      auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little\r\n      goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing for\r\n      sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c28-248\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c28-248.jpg (75K)\" src=\"images/c28-248.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2717824944446430104\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold—everything\r\n      but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.

Well, whilst they was at it a\r\n      steamboat landed, and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and\r\n      yelling and laughing and carrying on, and singing out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Here’s</i> your opposition line! here’s your two\r\n      sets o’ heirs to old Peter Wilks—and you pays your money and\r\n      you takes your choice!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c29-250\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c29\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c29-250.jpg (176K)\" src=\"images/c29-250.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6394683160622214138\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a\r\n      nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my\r\n      souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn’t\r\n      see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king\r\n      some to see any. I reckoned they’d turn pale. But no,\r\n      nary a pale did <i>they</i> turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned\r\n      what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like\r\n      a jug that’s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just\r\n      gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the\r\n      stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and\r\n      rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the\r\n      principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his\r\n      side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to\r\n      death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he\r\n      pronounced <i>like</i> an Englishman—not the king’s way,\r\n      though the king’s <i>was</i> pretty good for an imitation. I\r\n      can’t give the old gent’s words, nor I can’t imitate\r\n      him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “This is a surprise to me which I wasn’t looking for; and I’ll\r\n      acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain’t very well fixed to meet it\r\n      and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he’s broke\r\n      his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in\r\n      the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks’ brother Harvey, and\r\n      this is his brother William, which can’t hear nor speak—and\r\n      can’t even make signs to amount to much, now’t he’s only\r\n      got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a\r\n      day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won’t\r\n      say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers\r\n      out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Broke his arm—<i>very</i> likely, <i>ain’t</i> it?—and\r\n      very convenient, too, for a fraud that’s got to make signs, and ain’t\r\n      learnt how. Lost their baggage! That’s <i>mighty</i> good!—and\r\n      mighty ingenious—under the <i>circumstances</i>!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or\r\n      maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a\r\n      sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made\r\n      out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was\r\n      talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then\r\n      and nodding their heads—it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone\r\n      up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along\r\n      and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king\r\n      now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when’d you come to\r\n      this town?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The day before the funeral, friend,” says the king.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But what time o’ day?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “In the evenin’—’bout an hour er two before\r\n      sundown.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>How’d</i> you come?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, how’d you come to be up at the Pint in the <i>mornin</i>’—in\r\n      a canoe?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I warn’t up at the Pint in the mornin’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a lie.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an\r\n      old man and a preacher.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Preacher be hanged, he’s a fraud and a liar. He was up\r\n      at the Pint that mornin’. I live up there, don’t I?\r\n      Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there.\r\n      He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The doctor he up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon I would, but I don’t know. Why, yonder he is,\r\n      now. I know him perfectly easy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was me he pointed at. The doctor says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Neighbors, I don’t know whether the new couple is frauds or\r\n      not; but if <i>these</i> two ain’t frauds, I am an idiot, that’s\r\n      all. I think it’s our duty to see that they don’t get\r\n      away from here till we’ve looked into this thing. Come along, Hines;\r\n      come along, the rest of you. We’ll take these fellows to the\r\n      tavern and affront them with t’other couple, and I reckon we’ll\r\n      find out <i>something</i> before we get through.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king’s friends;\r\n      so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me\r\n      along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my\r\n      hand.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c29-252\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c29-252.jpg (62K)\" src=\"images/c29-252.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-353156157909661723\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and\r\n      fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think\r\n      they’re frauds, and they may have complices that we don’t know\r\n      nothing about. If they have, won’t the complices get away with\r\n      that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain’t unlikely. If\r\n      these men ain’t frauds, they won’t object to sending for that\r\n      money and letting us keep it till they prove they’re all right—ain’t\r\n      that so?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty\r\n      tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked\r\n      sorrowful, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain’t got no\r\n      disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out\r\n      investigation o’ this misable business; but, alas, the money ain’t\r\n      there; you k’n send and see, if you want to.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Where is it, then?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it\r\n      inside o’ the straw tick o’ my bed, not wishin’ to bank\r\n      it for the few days we’d be here, and considerin’ the bed a\r\n      safe place, we not bein’ used to niggers, and suppos’n’ \r\n      ’em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the\r\n      very next mornin’ after I had went down stairs; and when I sold\r\n      ’em I hadn’t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with\r\n      it. My servant here k’n tell you ’bout it, gentlemen.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The doctor and several said “Shucks!” and I see nobody didn’t\r\n      altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal\r\n      it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling\r\n      away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they\r\n      had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble\r\n      with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls\r\n      on me and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Are <i>you</i> English, too?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, “Stuff!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had\r\n      it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about\r\n      supper, nor ever seemed to think about it—and so they kept it up,\r\n      and kept it up; and it <i>was</i> the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.\r\n      They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman\r\n      tell his’n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a\r\n      <i>seen</i> that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t’other\r\n      one lies. And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The\r\n      king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I\r\n      knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about\r\n      Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and\r\n      so on; but I didn’t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh;\r\n      and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Set down, my boy; I wouldn’t strain myself if I was you.\r\n      I reckon you ain’t used to lying, it don’t seem to come\r\n      handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let\r\n      off, anyway.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If you’d been in town at first, Levi Bell—” The\r\n      king broke in and reached out his hand, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, is this my poor dead brother’s old friend that he’s\r\n      wrote so often about?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,\r\n      and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked\r\n      low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That ’ll fix it. I’ll take the order and send it,\r\n      along with your brother’s, and then they’ll know it’s\r\n      all right.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his\r\n      head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and\r\n      then they give the pen to the duke—and then for the first time the\r\n      duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the\r\n      lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your\r\n      names.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c29-255\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c29-255.jpg (36K)\" src=\"images/c29-255.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3926803632915623712\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn’t read it. The\r\n      lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it beats <i>me</i>”—and snaked a lot of old\r\n      letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old\r\n      man’s writing, and then <i>them</i> again; and then says: “These\r\n      old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here’s <i>these</i> two\r\n      handwritings, and anybody can see they didn’t write them” (the\r\n      king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the\r\n      lawyer had took them in), “and here’s <i>this</i> old\r\n      gentleman’s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, <i>he</i>\r\n      didn’t write them—fact is, the scratches he makes ain’t\r\n      properly <i>writing</i> at all. Now, here’s some letters from—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The new old gentleman says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my\r\n      brother there—so he copies for me. It’s <i>his</i> hand\r\n      you’ve got there, not mine.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Well</i>!” says the lawyer, “this <i>is</i> a state\r\n      of things. I’ve got some of William’s letters, too; so\r\n      if you’ll get him to write a line or so we can com—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He <i>can’t</i> write with his left hand,” says the old\r\n      gentleman. “If he could use his right hand, you would see that he\r\n      wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please—they’re\r\n      by the same hand.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The lawyer done it, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I believe it’s so—and if it ain’t so, there’s\r\n      a heap stronger resemblance than I’d noticed before, anyway. Well,\r\n      well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a solution, but\r\n      it’s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved—<i>these</i>\r\n      two ain’t either of ’em Wilkses”—and he wagged his\r\n      head towards the king and the duke.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn’t\r\n      give in <i>then</i>! Indeed he wouldn’t. Said it warn’t\r\n      no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in\r\n      the world, and hadn’t tried to write—<i>he</i> see William was\r\n      going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And\r\n      so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was\r\n      actuly beginning to believe what he was saying <i>himself</i>; but pretty\r\n      soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that\r\n      helped to lay out my br—helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for\r\n      burying?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” says somebody, “me and Ab Turner done it. We’re\r\n      both here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Blamed if the king didn’t have to brace up mighty quick, or he’d\r\n      a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him\r\n      so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most\r\n      <i>anybody</i> sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\r\n      notice, because how was <i>he</i> going to know what was tattooed on the\r\n      man? He whitened a little; he couldn’t help it; and it was\r\n      mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing\r\n      at him. Says I to myself, <i>now</i> he’ll throw up the sponge—there\r\n      ain’t no more use. Well, did he? A body can’t\r\n      hardly believe it, but he didn’t. I reckon he thought he’d\r\n      keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they’d thin out,\r\n      and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set\r\n      there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mf! It’s a <i>very</i> tough question, <i>ain’t</i>\r\n      it! <i>yes</i>, sir, I k’n tell you what’s tattooed on\r\n      his breast. It’s jest a small, thin, blue arrow—that’s\r\n      what it is; and if you don’t look clost, you can’t see it.\r\n      <i>now</i> what do you say—hey?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\r\n      cheek.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his\r\n      eye lights up like he judged he’d got the king <i>this</i> time, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “There—you’ve heard what he said! Was there any\r\n      such mark on Peter Wilks’ breast?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Both of them spoke up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We didn’t see no such mark.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good!” says the old gentleman. “Now, what you <i>did</i>\r\n      see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he\r\n      dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P—B—W”—and\r\n      he marked them that way on a piece of paper. “Come, ain’t that\r\n      what you saw?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Both of them spoke up again, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, we <i>didn’t</i>. We never seen any marks at all.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, everybody <i>was</i> in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The whole <i>bilin</i>’ of ’m ’s frauds! Le’s\r\n      duck ’em! le’s drown ’em! le’s ride ’em on a\r\n      rail!” and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling\r\n      powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gentlemen—gentle<i>men!</i> Hear me just a word—just\r\n      a <i>single</i> word—if you <i>please</i>! There’s one\r\n      way yet—let’s go and dig up the corpse and look.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c29-257\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c29-257.jpg (39K)\" src=\"images/c29-257.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6686313762724898288\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That took them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hooray!” they all shouted, and was starting right off; but\r\n      the lawyer and the doctor sung out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and\r\n      fetch <i>them</i> along, too!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We’ll do it!” they all shouted; “and if we don’t\r\n      find them marks we’ll lynch the whole gang!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I <i>was</i> scared, now, I tell you. But there warn’t no\r\n      getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along,\r\n      straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river,\r\n      and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only\r\n      nine in the evening.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      As we went by our house I wished I hadn’t sent Mary Jane out of\r\n      town; because now if I could tip her the wink she’d light out and\r\n      save me, and blow on our dead-beats.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like\r\n      wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the\r\n      lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst\r\n      the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was\r\n      in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what\r\n      I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I\r\n      wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me\r\n      and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world\r\n      betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn’t\r\n      find them—\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I couldn’t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn’t\r\n      think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a\r\n      beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by\r\n      the wrist—Hines—and a body might as well try to give Goliar\r\n      the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to\r\n      run to keep up.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it\r\n      like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had\r\n      about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn’t\r\n      thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by\r\n      the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half\r\n      a mile off, to borrow one.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain\r\n      started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come\r\n      brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no\r\n      notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could\r\n      see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of\r\n      dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it\r\n      all out, and you couldn’t see nothing at all.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then\r\n      such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge\r\n      in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was\r\n      awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I\r\n      reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and\r\n      somebody sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “By the living jingo, here’s the bag of gold on his breast!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give\r\n      a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and\r\n      shinned for the road in the dark there ain’t nobody can tell.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew—leastways, I had it\r\n      all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the\r\n      buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of\r\n      the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I struck the town I see there warn’t nobody out in the storm,\r\n      so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the\r\n      main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set\r\n      it. No light there; the house all dark—which made me feel sorry and\r\n      disappointed, I didn’t know why. But at last, just as I was\r\n      sailing by, <i>flash</i> comes the light in Mary Jane’s window! and\r\n      my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house\r\n      and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn’t ever going to be\r\n      before me no more in this world. She <i>was</i> the best girl I ever see,\r\n      and had the most sand.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the\r\n      towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time\r\n      the lightning showed me one that wasn’t chained I snatched it and\r\n      shoved. It was a canoe, and warn’t fastened with nothing but a rope.\r\n      The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the\r\n      middle of the river, but I didn’t lose no time; and when I struck\r\n      the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp\r\n      if I could afforded it. But I didn’t. As I sprung aboard\r\n      I sung out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness,\r\n      we’re shut of them!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c29-260\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c29-260.jpg (73K)\" src=\"images/c29-260.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8132862789157480663\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full\r\n      of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my\r\n      mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear\r\n      and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights\r\n      out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless\r\n      me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and\r\n      the duke, but I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut\r\n      loose and let her slide!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it <i>did</i>\r\n      seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and\r\n      nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and\r\n      crack my heels a few times—I couldn’t help it; but about the\r\n      third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my\r\n      breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash\r\n      busted out over the water, here they come!—and just a-laying to\r\n      their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all\r\n      I could do to keep from crying.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c30-261\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c30\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c30-261.jpg (165K)\" src=\"images/c30-261.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8602958022608739707\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXX.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tryin’ to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!

The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept\r\n      saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was\r\n      sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by\r\n      surprise by finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go\r\n      of me and whispers, ‘Heel it now, or they’ll hang ye, sure!’ \r\n      and I lit out. It didn’t seem no good for <i>me</i> to stay—I\r\n      couldn’t do nothing, and I didn’t want to be hung if I could\r\n      get away. So I never stopped running till I found the canoe; and\r\n      when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they’d catch me and hang me\r\n      yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn’t alive now, and I\r\n      was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we see you\r\n      coming; you may ask Jim if I didn’t.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, “Oh,\r\n      yes, it’s <i>mighty</i> likely!” and shook me up again, and\r\n      said he reckoned he’d drownd me. But the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Leggo the boy, you old idiot! Would <i>you</i> a done any\r\n      different? Did you inquire around for <i>him</i> when you got loose?\r\n      I don’t remember it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it.\r\n      But the duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You better a blame’ sight give <i>yourself</i> a good\r\n      cussing, for you’re the one that’s entitled to it most. You\r\n      hain’t done a thing from the start that had any sense in it, except\r\n      coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark. That\r\n      <i>was</i> bright—it was right down bully; and it was the thing that\r\n      saved us. For if it hadn’t been for that they’d a jailed\r\n      us till them Englishmen’s baggage come—and then—the\r\n      penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took ’em to the graveyard, and\r\n      the gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn’t\r\n      let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we’d a slept in\r\n      our cravats to-night—cravats warranted to <i>wear</i>, too—longer\r\n      than <i>we’d</i> need ’em.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They was still a minute—thinking; then the king says, kind of\r\n      absent-minded like:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mf! And we reckoned the <i>niggers</i> stole it!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That made me squirm!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and\r\n      sarcastic, “<i>we</i> did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      After about a half a minute the king drawls out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Leastways, I did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says, the same way:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “On the contrary, I did.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king kind of ruffles up, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Looky here, Bilgewater, what’r you referrin’ to?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says, pretty brisk:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “When it comes to that, maybe you’ll let me ask, what was <i>you</i>\r\n      referring to?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks!” says the king, very sarcastic; “but I don’t\r\n      know—maybe you was asleep, and didn’t know what you was about.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke bristles up now, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, let <i>up</i> on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a\r\n      blame’ fool? Don’t you reckon I know who hid that money in\r\n      that coffin?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Yes</i>, sir! I know you <i>do</i> know, because you done\r\n      it yourself!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a lie!”—and the duke went for him. The\r\n      king sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Take y’r hands off!—leggo my throat!—I take it\r\n      all back!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c30-263\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c30-263.jpg (54K)\" src=\"images/c30-263.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-9201007633647963919\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you just own up, first, that you <i>did</i> hide that money\r\n      there, intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and\r\n      dig it up, and have it all to yourself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Wait jest a minute, duke—answer me this one question, honest\r\n      and fair; if you didn’t put the money there, say it, and I’ll\r\n      b’lieve you, and take back everything I said.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You old scoundrel, I didn’t, and you know I didn’t.\r\n      There, now!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, I b’lieve you. But answer me only jest this\r\n      one more—now <i>don’t</i> git mad; didn’t you have it in\r\n      your mind to hook the money and hide it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I don’t care if I <i>did</i>, I didn’t <i>do</i>\r\n      it, anyway. But you not only had it in mind to do it, but you <i>done</i>\r\n      it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that’s honest.\r\n      I won’t say I warn’t goin’ to do it, because I <i>was</i>;\r\n      but you—I mean somebody—got in ahead o’ me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a lie! You done it, and you got to <i>say</i> you\r\n      done it, or—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “’Nough!—I <i>own up!</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier\r\n      than what I was feeling before. So the duke took his hands off and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “If you ever deny it again I’ll drown you. It’s <i>well</i>\r\n      for you to set there and blubber like a baby—it’s fitten for\r\n      you, after the way you’ve acted. I never see such an old ostrich for\r\n      wanting to gobble everything—and I a-trusting you all the time, like\r\n      you was my own father. You ought to been ashamed of yourself to\r\n      stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers, and you never\r\n      say a word for ’em. It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was\r\n      soft enough to <i>believe</i> that rubbage. Cuss you, I can see now\r\n      why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit—you wanted to get\r\n      what money I’d got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another, and\r\n      scoop it <i>all</i>!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn’t\r\n      me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Dry up! I don’t want to hear no more out of you!”\r\n      says the duke. “And <i>now</i> you see what you GOT by it. They’ve\r\n      got all their own money back, and all of <i>ourn</i> but a shekel or two\r\n      <i>besides</i>. G’long to bed, and don’t you deffersit\r\n      <i>me</i> no more deffersits, long ’s <i>you</i> live!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,\r\n      and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an\r\n      hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the\r\n      lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other’s arms.\r\n      They both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn’t\r\n      get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the\r\n      money-bag again. That made me feel easy and satisfied. Of\r\n      course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble, and I told Jim\r\n      everything.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c31-266\"></a><br> <br>\r\n<a id=\"c31\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c31-266.jpg (180K)\" src=\"images/c31-266.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7582320663349533621\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We dasn’t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along\r\n      down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a\r\n      mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish\r\n      moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It\r\n      was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\r\n      dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they\r\n      begun to work the villages again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn’t make enough\r\n      for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started\r\n      a dancing-school; but they didn’t know no more how to dance than a\r\n      kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in\r\n      and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at\r\n      yellocution; but they didn’t yellocute long till the audience got up\r\n      and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They\r\n      tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling\r\n      fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn’t seem to have\r\n      no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around\r\n      the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying\r\n      nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in\r\n      the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim\r\n      and me got uneasy. We didn’t like the look of it. We\r\n      judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We\r\n      turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going\r\n      to break into somebody’s house or store, or was going into the\r\n      counterfeit-money business, or something. So then we was pretty scared,\r\n      and made up an agreement that we wouldn’t have nothing in the world\r\n      to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give\r\n      them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one\r\n      morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a\r\n      little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went\r\n      ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt\r\n      around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet.\r\n      (“House to rob, you <i>mean</i>,” says I to myself; “and\r\n      when you get through robbing it you’ll come back here and wonder\r\n      what has become of me and Jim and the raft—and you’ll have to\r\n      take it out in wondering.”) And he said if he warn’t back by\r\n      midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come\r\n      along.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around,\r\n      and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we\r\n      couldn’t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little\r\n      thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when\r\n      midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway—and maybe a\r\n      chance for <i>the</i> change on top of it. So me and the duke went\r\n      up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we\r\n      found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot\r\n      of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening\r\n      with all his might, and so tight he couldn’t walk, and couldn’t\r\n      do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool,\r\n      and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I\r\n      lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river\r\n      road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it\r\n      would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got\r\n      down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Set her loose, Jim! we’re all right now!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But there warn’t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.\r\n      Jim was gone! I set up a shout—and then another—and\r\n      then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and\r\n      screeching; but it warn’t no use—old Jim was gone. Then\r\n      I set down and cried; I couldn’t help it. But I couldn’t set\r\n      still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what\r\n      I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he’d\r\n      seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Whereabouts?” says I.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Down to Silas Phelps’ place, two mile below here. He’s\r\n      a runaway nigger, and they’ve got him. Was you looking for\r\n      him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You bet I ain’t! I run across him in the woods about an\r\n      hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he’d cut my livers out—and\r\n      told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there\r\n      ever since; afeard to come out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” he says, “you needn’t be afeard no more,\r\n      becuz they’ve got him. He run off f’m down South, som’ers.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a good job they got him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I <i>reckon</i>! There’s two hunderd dollars\r\n      reward on him. It’s like picking up money out’n the\r\n      road.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, it is—and I could a had it if I’d been big enough;\r\n      I see him <i>first</i>. Who nailed him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c31-269\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c31-269.jpg (64K)\" src=\"images/c31-269.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2478652794851798642\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It was an old fellow—a stranger—and he sold out his\r\n      chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he’s got to go up the river\r\n      and can’t wait. Think o’ that, now! You bet <i>I’d</i>\r\n      wait, if it was seven year.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That’s me, every time,” says I. “But maybe his\r\n      chance ain’t worth no more than that, if he’ll sell it so\r\n      cheap. Maybe there’s something ain’t straight about it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But it <i>is</i>, though—straight as a string. I see\r\n      the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot—paints\r\n      him like a picture, and tells the plantation he’s frum, below Newr<i>leans</i>.\r\n      No-sirree-<i>bob</i>, they ain’t no trouble ’bout <i>that</i>\r\n      speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won’t\r\n      ye?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set\r\n      down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn’t come to nothing.\r\n      I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn’t see no way\r\n      out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and after all we’d\r\n      done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all\r\n      busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such\r\n      a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst\r\n      strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a\r\n      slave at home where his family was, as long as he’d <i>got</i> to be\r\n      a slave, and so I’d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him\r\n      to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for\r\n      two things: she’d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and\r\n      ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she’d sell him straight down\r\n      the river again; and if she didn’t, everybody naturally despises an\r\n      ungrateful nigger, and they’d make Jim feel it all the time, and so\r\n      he’d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of <i>me</i>! It\r\n      would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom;\r\n      and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I’d be ready\r\n      to get down and lick his boots for shame. That’s just the way:\r\n      a person does a low-down thing, and then he don’t want to take\r\n      no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide it, it ain’t no\r\n      disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the\r\n      more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down\r\n      and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden\r\n      that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and\r\n      letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there\r\n      in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman’s nigger that hadn’t\r\n      ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there’s One that’s\r\n      always on the lookout, and ain’t a-going to allow no such miserable\r\n      doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks\r\n      I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it\r\n      up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn’t\r\n      so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, “There was\r\n      the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you’d a done it\r\n      they’d a learnt you there that people that acts as I’d been\r\n      acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I\r\n      couldn’t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.\r\n      So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn’t come. Why\r\n      wouldn’t they? It warn’t no use to try and hide it from\r\n      Him. Nor from <i>me</i>, neither. I knowed very well why they\r\n      wouldn’t come. It was because my heart warn’t right; it\r\n      was because I warn’t square; it was because I was playing double.\r\n      I was letting <i>on</i> to give up sin, but away inside of me I was\r\n      holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth\r\n      <i>say</i> I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and\r\n      write to that nigger’s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in\r\n      me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can’t pray a\r\n      lie—I found that out.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn’t know what\r\n      to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I’ll go and write the\r\n      letter—and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing,\r\n      the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles\r\n      all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and\r\n      excited, and set down and wrote:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below\r\n      Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the\r\n      reward if you send.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Huck Finn.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c31-271\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c31-271.jpg (62K)\" src=\"images/c31-271.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1617948401028712537\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt\r\n      so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn’t do\r\n      it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking\r\n      how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost\r\n      and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking\r\n      over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in\r\n      the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and\r\n      we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I\r\n      couldn’t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only\r\n      the other kind. I’d see him standing my watch on top of his’n,\r\n      ’stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how\r\n      glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again\r\n      in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would\r\n      always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for\r\n      me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him\r\n      by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and\r\n      said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the <i>only</i>\r\n      one he’s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that\r\n      paper.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I\r\n      was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two\r\n      things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my\r\n      breath, and then says to myself:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, then, I’ll <i>go</i> to hell”—and tore\r\n      it up.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let\r\n      them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved\r\n      the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again,\r\n      which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn’t.\r\n      And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery\r\n      again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too;\r\n      because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole\r\n      hog.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\r\n      considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited\r\n      me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the\r\n      river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft\r\n      and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the\r\n      night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and\r\n      put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another\r\n      in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed\r\n      below where I judged was Phelps’s place, and hid my bundle in the\r\n      woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her\r\n      and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a\r\n      quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,\r\n      “Phelps’s Sawmill,” and when I come to the farm-houses,\r\n      two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn’t\r\n      see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn’t\r\n      mind, because I didn’t want to see nobody just yet—I only\r\n      wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to\r\n      turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a\r\n      look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see\r\n      when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the\r\n      Royal Nonesuch—three-night performance—like that other time.\r\n      They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I\r\n      could shirk. He looked astonished, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hel-<i>lo</i>! Where’d <i>you</i> come from?”\r\n      Then he says, kind of glad and eager, “Where’s the raft?—got\r\n      her in a good place?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, that’s just what I was going to ask your grace.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he didn’t look so joyful, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What was your idea for asking <i>me</i>?” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” I says, “when I see the king in that doggery\r\n      yesterday I says to myself, we can’t get him home for hours, till he’s\r\n      soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.\r\n      A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the\r\n      river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was\r\n      dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went\r\n      behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose\r\n      and run, and we after him. We didn’t have no dog, and so we\r\n      had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We\r\n      never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for\r\n      the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself,\r\n      ’They’ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they’ve\r\n      took my nigger, which is the only nigger I’ve got in the world, and\r\n      now I’m in a strange country, and ain’t got no property no\r\n      more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;’ so I set down and\r\n      cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what <i>did</i>\r\n      become of the raft, then?—and Jim—poor Jim!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blamed if I know—that is, what’s become of the raft.\r\n      That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we\r\n      found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and\r\n      got every cent but what he’d spent for whisky; and when I got him\r\n      home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, ‘That little\r\n      rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.’”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I wouldn’t shake my <i>nigger</i>, would I?—the only\r\n      nigger I had in the world, and the only property.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we’d come\r\n      to consider him <i>our</i> nigger; yes, we did consider him so—goodness\r\n      knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was\r\n      gone and we flat broke, there warn’t anything for it but to try the\r\n      Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I’ve pegged along ever since, dry\r\n      as a powder-horn. Where’s that ten cents? Give it here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c31-274\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c31-274.jpg (57K)\" src=\"images/c31-274.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3627241286352250060\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend\r\n      it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I\r\n      had, and I hadn’t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never\r\n      said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We’d skin\r\n      him if he done that!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How can he blow? Hain’t he run off?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and\r\n      the money’s gone.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Sold</i> him?” I says, and begun to cry; “why,\r\n      he was <i>my</i> nigger, and that was my money. Where is he?—I\r\n      want my nigger.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you can’t <i>get</i> your nigger, that’s all—so\r\n      dry up your blubbering. Looky here—do you think <i>you’d</i>\r\n      venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I’d trust you. Why,\r\n      if you <i>was</i> to blow on us—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before.\r\n      I went on a-whimpering, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t want to blow on nobody; and I ain’t got no time\r\n      to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\r\n      his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll tell you something. We got to be here three days.\r\n      If you’ll promise you won’t blow, and won’t let\r\n      the nigger blow, I’ll tell you where to find him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I promised, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A farmer by the name of Silas Ph—” and then he stopped.\r\n      You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that\r\n      way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his\r\n      mind. And so he was. He wouldn’t trust me; he wanted to make\r\n      sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty\r\n      soon he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The man that bought him is named Abram Foster—Abram G. Foster—and\r\n      he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right,” I says, “I can walk it in three days.\r\n      And I’ll start this very afternoon.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No you wont, you’ll start <i>now</i>; and don’t you\r\n      lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just\r\n      keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won’t\r\n      get into trouble with <i>us</i>, d’ye hear?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I\r\n      wanted to be left free to work my plans.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So clear out,” he says; “and you can tell Mr. Foster\r\n      whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim <i>is</i>\r\n      your nigger—some idiots don’t require documents—leastways\r\n      I’ve heard there’s such down South here. And when you\r\n      tell him the handbill and the reward’s bogus, maybe he’ll\r\n      believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting ’em\r\n      out. Go ’long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind\r\n      you don’t work your jaw any <i>between</i> here and there.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c31-275\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c31-275.jpg (45K)\" src=\"images/c31-275.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1848260829379816900\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I left, and struck for the back country. I didn’t look\r\n      around, but I kinder felt like he was watching me. But I knowed I\r\n      could tire him out at that. I went straight out in the country as\r\n      much as a mile before I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods\r\n      towards Phelps’. I reckoned I better start in on my plan\r\n      straight off without fooling around, because I wanted to stop Jim’s\r\n      mouth till these fellows could get away. I didn’t want no\r\n      trouble with their kind. I’d seen all I wanted to of them, and\r\n      wanted to get entirely shut of them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c32-277\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c32\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c32-277.jpg (169K)\" src=\"images/c32-277.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3424360050507789979\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;\r\n      the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint\r\n      dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and\r\n      like everybody’s dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and\r\n      quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it’s\r\n      spirits whispering—spirits that’s been dead ever so many years—and\r\n      you always think they’re talking about <i>you</i>. As a\r\n      general thing it makes a body wish <i>he</i> was dead, too, and done with\r\n      it all.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Phelps’ was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and\r\n      they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile\r\n      made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a\r\n      different length, to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand\r\n      on when they are going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in\r\n      the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the\r\n      nap rubbed off; big double log-house for the white folks—hewed logs,\r\n      with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been\r\n      whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,\r\n      open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of\r\n      the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t’other side\r\n      the smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back\r\n      fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and\r\n      big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,\r\n      with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more\r\n      hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;\r\n      some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;\r\n      outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton\r\n      fields begins, and after the fields the woods.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and started\r\n      for the kitchen. When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a\r\n      spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then I\r\n      knowed for certain I wished I was dead—for that <i>is</i> the\r\n      lonesomest sound in the whole world.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting\r\n      to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for I’d\r\n      noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I\r\n      left it alone.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for\r\n      me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still. And such\r\n      another powwow as they made! In a quarter of a minute I was a kind\r\n      of a hub of a wheel, as you may say—spokes made out of dogs—circle\r\n      of fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses\r\n      stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you\r\n      could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her\r\n      hand, singing out, “Begone <i>you</i> Tige! you Spot! begone sah!”\r\n      and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them\r\n      howling, and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come\r\n      back, wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me. There\r\n      ain’t no harm in a hound, nohow.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys\r\n      without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their mother’s\r\n      gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way they always\r\n      do. And here comes the white woman running from the house, about\r\n      forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in her\r\n      hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same way\r\n      the little niggers was doing. She was smiling all over so she could\r\n      hardly stand—and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s <i>you</i>, at last!—<i>ain’t</i> it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I out with a “Yes’m” before I thought.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c32-279\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c32-279.jpg (55K)\" src=\"images/c32-279.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1090440969225170288\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and\r\n      shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and\r\n      she couldn’t seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, “You\r\n      don’t look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law\r\n      sakes, I don’t care for that, I’m so glad to see you! Dear,\r\n      dear, it does seem like I could eat you up! Children, it’s\r\n      your cousin Tom!—tell him howdy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and\r\n      hid behind her. So she run on:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away—or did\r\n      you get your breakfast on the boat?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I said I had got it on the boat. So then she started for the house,\r\n      leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after. When we got\r\n      there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on a\r\n      little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now I can have a <i>good</i> look at you; and, laws-a-me, I’ve\r\n      been hungry for it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it’s\r\n      come at last! We been expecting you a couple of days and more. What\r\n      kep’ you?—boat get aground?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes’m—she—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t say yes’m—say Aunt Sally. Where’d\r\n      she get aground?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t rightly know what to say, because I didn’t know\r\n      whether the boat would be coming up the river or down. But I go a\r\n      good deal on instinct; and my instinct said she would be coming up—from\r\n      down towards Orleans. That didn’t help me much, though; for I didn’t\r\n      know the names of bars down that way. I see I’d got to invent\r\n      a bar, or forget the name of the one we got aground on—or—Now\r\n      I struck an idea, and fetched it out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It warn’t the grounding—that didn’t keep us back\r\n      but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good gracious! anybody hurt?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No’m. Killed a nigger.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it’s lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.\r\n      Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from\r\n      Newrleans on the old Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and\r\n      crippled a man. And I think he died afterwards. He was a\r\n      Baptist. Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed\r\n      his people very well. Yes, I remember now, he <i>did</i> die. Mortification\r\n      set in, and they had to amputate him. But it didn’t save him. Yes,\r\n      it was mortification—that was it. He turned blue all over, and\r\n      died in the hope of a glorious resurrection. They say he was a sight to\r\n      look at. Your uncle’s been up to the town every day to fetch\r\n      you. And he’s gone again, not more’n an hour ago; he’ll\r\n      be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn’t you?—oldish\r\n      man, with a—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, I didn’t see nobody, Aunt Sally. The boat landed\r\n      just at daylight, and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking\r\n      around the town and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not\r\n      get here too soon; and so I come down the back way.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who’d you give the baggage to?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Nobody.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, child, it ’ll be stole!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Not where I hid it I reckon it won’t,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How’d you get your breakfast so early on the boat?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was kinder thin ice, but I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have\r\n      something to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the\r\n      officers’ lunch, and give me all I wanted.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was getting so uneasy I couldn’t listen good. I had my mind\r\n      on the children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and\r\n      pump them a little, and find out who I was. But I couldn’t get\r\n      no show, Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so. Pretty soon she made\r\n      the cold chills streak all down my back, because she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But here we’re a-running on this way, and you hain’t\r\n      told me a word about Sis, nor any of them. Now I’ll rest my\r\n      works a little, and you start up yourn; just tell me <i>everything</i>—tell\r\n      me all about ’m all every one of ’m; and how they are, and\r\n      what they’re doing, and what they told you to tell me; and every\r\n      last thing you can think of.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I see I was up a stump—and up it good. Providence had\r\n      stood by me this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.\r\n      I see it warn’t a bit of use to try to go ahead—I’d\r\n      got to throw up my hand. So I says to myself, here’s another\r\n      place where I got to resk the truth. I opened my mouth to begin; but\r\n      she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here he comes! Stick your head down lower—there, that’ll\r\n      do; you can’t be seen now. Don’t you let on you’re\r\n      here. I’ll play a joke on him. Children, don’t you say a\r\n      word.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see I was in a fix now. But it warn’t no use to worry; there\r\n      warn’t nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to\r\n      stand from under when the lightning struck.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then\r\n      the bed hid him. Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Has he come?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” says her husband.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good-<i>ness</i> gracious!” she says, “what in the\r\n      warld can have become of him?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I can’t imagine,” says the old gentleman; “and I\r\n      must say it makes me dreadful uneasy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Uneasy!” she says; “I’m ready to go distracted!\r\n      He <i>must</i> a come; and you’ve missed him along the road.\r\n      I <i>know</i> it’s so—something tells me so.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Sally, I <i>couldn’t</i> miss him along the road—<i>you</i>\r\n      know that.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But oh, dear, dear, what <i>will</i> Sis say! He must a come!\r\n      You must a missed him. He—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, don’t distress me any more’n I’m already\r\n      distressed. I don’t know what in the world to make of it.\r\n      I’m at my wit’s end, and I don’t mind\r\n      acknowledging ’t I’m right down scared. But there’s\r\n      no hope that he’s come; for he <i>couldn’t</i> come and me\r\n      miss him. Sally, it’s terrible—just terrible—something’s\r\n      happened to the boat, sure!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Silas! Look yonder!—up the road!—ain’t\r\n      that somebody coming?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps\r\n      the chance she wanted. She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed\r\n      and give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the\r\n      window there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I\r\n      standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside. The old gentleman stared,\r\n      and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, who’s that?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who do you reckon ’t is?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c32-283\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c32-283.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c32-283.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3723518693207810920\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t no idea. Who <i>is</i> it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s <i>Tom Sawyer!</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      By jings, I most slumped through the floor! But there warn’t\r\n      no time to swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and\r\n      kept on shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh\r\n      and cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and\r\n      Mary, and the rest of the tribe.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But if they was joyful, it warn’t nothing to what I was; for it was\r\n      like being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was. Well,\r\n      they froze to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it\r\n      couldn’t hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family—I\r\n      mean the Sawyer family—than ever happened to any six Sawyer\r\n      families. And I explained all about how we blowed out a\r\n      cylinder-head at the mouth of White River, and it took us three days to\r\n      fix it. Which was all right, and worked first-rate; because <i>they</i>\r\n      didn’t know but what it would take three days to fix it. If I’d\r\n      a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty\r\n      uncomfortable all up the other. Being Tom Sawyer was easy and\r\n      comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a\r\n      steamboat coughing along down the river. Then I says to myself, s’pose\r\n      Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat? And s’pose he steps in\r\n      here any minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to\r\n      keep quiet?\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I couldn’t <i>have</i> it that way; it wouldn’t do at\r\n      all. I must go up the road and waylay him. So I told the folks\r\n      I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage. The\r\n      old gentleman was for going along with me, but I said no, I could drive\r\n      the horse myself, and I druther he wouldn’t take no trouble about\r\n      me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c33-284\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c33\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c33-284.jpg (153K)\" src=\"images/c33-284.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3659184657320856092\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon\r\n      coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till\r\n      he come along. I says “Hold on!” and it stopped\r\n      alongside, and his mouth opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he\r\n      swallowed two or three times like a person that’s got a dry throat,\r\n      and then says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t ever done you no harm. You know that. So,\r\n      then, what you want to come back and ha’nt <i>me</i> for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t come back—I hain’t been <i>gone</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn’t quite\r\n      satisfied yet. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you play nothing on me, because I wouldn’t on\r\n      you. Honest injun now, you ain’t a ghost?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Honest injun, I ain’t,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well—I—I—well, that ought to settle it, of\r\n      course; but I can’t somehow seem to understand it no way. Looky\r\n      here, warn’t you ever murdered <i>at all?</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No. I warn’t ever murdered at all—I played it on\r\n      them. You come in here and feel of me if you don’t believe me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again\r\n      he didn’t know what to do. And he wanted to know all about it\r\n      right off, because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit\r\n      him where he lived. But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and\r\n      told his driver to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him\r\n      the kind of a fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do? He\r\n      said, let him alone a minute, and don’t disturb him. So he\r\n      thought and thought, and pretty soon he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s all right; I’ve got it. Take my trunk in\r\n      your wagon, and let on it’s your’n; and you turn back and fool\r\n      along slow, so as to get to the house about the time you ought to; and I’ll\r\n      go towards town a piece, and take a fresh start, and get there a quarter\r\n      or a half an hour after you; and you needn’t let on to know me at\r\n      first.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right; but wait a minute. There’s one more thing—a\r\n      thing that <i>nobody</i> don’t know but me. And that is, there’s\r\n      a nigger here that I’m a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his\r\n      name is <i>Jim</i>—old Miss Watson’s Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What! Why, Jim is—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He stopped and went to studying. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I know what you’ll say. You’ll say it’s\r\n      dirty, low-down business; but what if it is? I’m low down; and\r\n      I’m a-going to steal him, and I want you keep mum and not let on.\r\n      Will you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      His eye lit up, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll <i>help</i> you steal him!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was the most\r\n      astonishing speech I ever heard—and I’m bound to say Tom\r\n      Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn’t\r\n      believe it. Tom Sawyer a <i>nigger-stealer!</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, shucks!” I says; “you’re joking.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I ain’t joking, either.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then,” I says, “joking or no joking, if you hear\r\n      anything said about a runaway nigger, don’t forget to remember that\r\n      <i>you</i> don’t know nothing about him, and I don’t know\r\n      nothing about him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way\r\n      and I drove mine. But of course I forgot all about driving slow on\r\n      accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too\r\n      quick for that length of a trip. The old gentleman was at the door,\r\n      and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, this is wonderful! Whoever would a thought it was in\r\n      that mare to do it? I wish we’d a timed her. And she\r\n      hain’t sweated a hair—not a hair. It’s wonderful. Why,\r\n      I wouldn’t take a hundred dollars for that horse now—I wouldn’t,\r\n      honest; and yet I’d a sold her for fifteen before, and thought\r\n      ’twas all she was worth.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That’s all he said. He was the innocentest, best old soul I\r\n      ever see. But it warn’t surprising; because he warn’t only\r\n      just a farmer, he was a preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log\r\n      church down back of the plantation, which he built it himself at his own\r\n      expense, for a church and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his\r\n      preaching, and it was worth it, too. There was plenty other\r\n      farmer-preachers like that, and done the same way, down South.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In about half an hour Tom’s wagon drove up to the front stile, and\r\n      Aunt Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty\r\n      yards, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, there’s somebody come! I wonder who ’tis?\r\n      Why, I do believe it’s a stranger. Jimmy” (that’s\r\n      one of the children) “run and tell Lize to put on another plate for\r\n      dinner.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger\r\n      don’t come <i>every</i> year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever,\r\n      for interest, when he does come. Tom was over the stile and starting\r\n      for the house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we\r\n      was all bunched in the front door. Tom had his store clothes on, and\r\n      an audience—and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer. In them\r\n      circumstances it warn’t no trouble to him to throw in an amount of\r\n      style that was suitable. He warn’t a boy to meeky along up\r\n      that yard like a sheep; no, he come ca’m and important, like the\r\n      ram. When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and\r\n      dainty, like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and\r\n      he didn’t want to disturb them, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c33-287\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c33-287.jpg (42K)\" src=\"images/c33-287.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8968273763683281272\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, my boy,” says the old gentleman, “I’m sorry\r\n      to say ’t your driver has deceived you; Nichols’s place is\r\n      down a matter of three mile more. Come in, come in.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, “Too late—he’s\r\n      out of sight.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, he’s gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your\r\n      dinner with us; and then we’ll hitch up and take you down to Nichols’s.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, I <i>can’t</i> make you so much trouble; I couldn’t\r\n      think of it. I’ll walk—I don’t mind the distance.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But we won’t <i>let</i> you walk—it wouldn’t be\r\n      Southern hospitality to do it. Come right in.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, <i>do</i>,” says Aunt Sally; “it ain’t a bit\r\n      of trouble to us, not a bit in the world. You must stay. It’s\r\n      a long, dusty three mile, and we can’t let you walk. And,\r\n      besides, I’ve already told ’em to put on another plate when I\r\n      see you coming; so you mustn’t disappoint us. Come right in\r\n      and make yourself at home.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be\r\n      persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from\r\n      Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson—and he made\r\n      another bow.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and\r\n      everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and\r\n      wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,\r\n      still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the\r\n      mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was going\r\n      on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand,\r\n      and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You owdacious puppy!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked kind of hurt, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m surprised at you, m’am.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You’re s’rp—Why, what do you reckon I am? I’ve\r\n      a good notion to take and—Say, what do you mean by kissing me?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked kind of humble, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I didn’t mean nothing, m’am. I didn’t mean\r\n      no harm. I—I—thought you’d like it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, you born fool!” She took up the spinning stick,\r\n      and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack\r\n      with it. “What made you think I’d like it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I don’t know. Only, they—they—told me\r\n      you would.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>They</i> told you I would. Whoever told you’s <i>another</i>\r\n      lunatic. I never heard the beat of it. Who’s <i>they</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, everybody. They all said so, m’am.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers\r\n      worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who’s ‘everybody’? Out with their names, or\r\n      ther’ll be an idiot short.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m sorry, and I warn’t expecting it. They told\r\n      me to. They all told me to. They all said, kiss her; and said\r\n      she’d like it. They all said it—every one of them.\r\n      But I’m sorry, m’am, and I won’t do it no more—I\r\n      won’t, honest.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You won’t, won’t you? Well, I sh’d <i>reckon</i>\r\n      you won’t!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No’m, I’m honest about it; I won’t ever do it\r\n      again—till you ask me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Till I <i>ask</i> you! Well, I never see the beat of it in my\r\n      born days! I lay you’ll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation\r\n      before ever I ask you—or the likes of you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” he says, “it does surprise me so. I can’t\r\n      make it out, somehow. They said you would, and I thought you would. But—”\r\n      He stopped and looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a\r\n      friendly eye somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman’s, and\r\n      says, “Didn’t <i>you</i> think she’d like me to kiss\r\n      her, sir?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, no; I—I—well, no, I b’lieve I didn’t.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tom, didn’t <i>you</i> think Aunt Sally ’d open out her\r\n      arms and say, ‘Sid Sawyer—‘”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “My land!” she says, breaking in and jumping for him, “you\r\n      impudent young rascal, to fool a body so—” and was going to\r\n      hug him, but he fended her off, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, not till you’ve asked me first.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So she didn’t lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed\r\n      him over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he\r\n      took what was left. And after they got a little quiet again she\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise. We warn’t\r\n      looking for <i>you</i> at all, but only Tom. Sis never wrote to me\r\n      about anybody coming but him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s because it warn’t <i>intended</i> for any of us to\r\n      come but Tom,” he says; “but I begged and begged, and at the\r\n      last minute she let me come, too; so, coming down the river, me and Tom\r\n      thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the\r\n      house first, and for me to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to\r\n      be a stranger. But it was a mistake, Aunt Sally. This ain’t\r\n      no healthy place for a stranger to come.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No—not impudent whelps, Sid. You ought to had your jaws\r\n      boxed; I hain’t been so put out since I don’t know when.\r\n      But I don’t care, I don’t mind the terms—I’d\r\n      be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here. Well, to think\r\n      of that performance! I don’t deny it, I was most putrified\r\n      with astonishment when you give me that smack.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c33-290\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c33-290.jpg (54K)\" src=\"images/c33-290.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6598564372019123864\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the\r\n      kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families—and\r\n      all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that’s laid in a\r\n      cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold\r\n      cannibal in the morning. Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing\r\n      over it, but it was worth it; and it didn’t cool it a bit, neither,\r\n      the way I’ve seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\r\n      There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\r\n      and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn’t no use, they\r\n      didn’t happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was\r\n      afraid to try to work up to it. But at supper, at night, one of the\r\n      little boys says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Pa, mayn’t Tom and Sid and me go to the show?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No,” says the old man, “I reckon there ain’t\r\n      going to be any; and you couldn’t go if there was; because the\r\n      runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show, and\r\n      Burton said he would tell the people; so I reckon they’ve drove the\r\n      owdacious loafers out of town before this time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So there it was!—but I couldn’t help it. Tom and me was\r\n      to sleep in the same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and\r\n      went up to bed right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down\r\n      the lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn’t believe\r\n      anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn’t\r\n      hurry up and give them one they’d get into trouble sure.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,\r\n      and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn’t come back no more,\r\n      and what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our\r\n      Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time\r\n      to; and as we struck into the town and up through the the middle of it--it\r\n      was as much as half-after eight, then—here comes a raging rush of\r\n      people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\r\n      pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by; and\r\n      as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail—that\r\n      is, I knowed it <i>was</i> the king and the duke, though they was all over\r\n      tar and feathers, and didn’t look like nothing in the world that was\r\n      human—just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier-plumes.\r\n      Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for them poor\r\n      pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn’t ever feel any hardness\r\n      against them any more in the world. It was a dreadful thing to see.\r\n      Human beings <i>can</i> be awful cruel to one another.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c33-291\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c33-291.jpg (60K)\" src=\"images/c33-291.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-3038821716102653310\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We see we was too late—couldn’t do no good. We asked\r\n      some stragglers about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking\r\n      very innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in\r\n      the middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal,\r\n      and the house rose up and went for them.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we poked along back home, and I warn’t feeling so brash as I was\r\n      before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow—though\r\n      I hadn’t done nothing. But that’s always the way; it don’t\r\n      make no difference whether you do right or wrong, a person’s\r\n      conscience ain’t got no sense, and just goes for him anyway. If\r\n      I had a yaller dog that didn’t know no more than a person’s\r\n      conscience does I would pison him. It takes up more room than all the rest\r\n      of a person’s insides, and yet ain’t no good, nohow.

By and by Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!\r\n      I bet I know where Jim is.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No! Where?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When\r\n      we was at dinner, didn’t you see a nigger man go in there with some\r\n      vittles?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What did you think the vittles was for?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “For a dog.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So ’d I. Well, it wasn’t for a dog.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Because part of it was watermelon.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “So it was—I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I\r\n      never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body\r\n      can see and don’t see at the same time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he\r\n      locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the\r\n      time we got up from table—same key, I bet. Watermelon shows\r\n      man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain’t likely there’s two\r\n      prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people’s all so\r\n      kind and good. Jim’s the prisoner. All right—I’m\r\n      glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn’t give shucks for\r\n      any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal\r\n      Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we’ll take the one we like\r\n      the best.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer’s head\r\n      I wouldn’t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor\r\n      clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking\r\n      out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where\r\n      the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ready?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right—bring it out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “My plan is this,” I says. “We can easy find out if it’s\r\n      Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over\r\n      from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key\r\n      out of the old man’s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off\r\n      down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights,\r\n      the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn’t that plan work?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Work</i>? Why, cert’nly it would work, like rats\r\n      a-fighting. But it’s too blame’ simple; there ain’t\r\n      nothing <i>to</i> it. What’s the good of a plan that ain’t\r\n      no more trouble than that? It’s as mild as goose-milk. Why,\r\n      Huck, it wouldn’t make no more talk than breaking into a soap\r\n      factory.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I never said nothing, because I warn’t expecting nothing different;\r\n      but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got <i>his</i> plan ready it\r\n      wouldn’t have none of them objections to it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And it didn’t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute\r\n      it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a\r\n      man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was\r\n      satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn’t tell\r\n      what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn’t stay the way, it was.\r\n      I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went\r\n      along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And\r\n      that is what he done.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\r\n      earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\r\n      That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was\r\n      respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at\r\n      home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and\r\n      knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,\r\n      without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this\r\n      business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before\r\n      everybody. I <i>couldn’t</i> understand it no way at all.\r\n      It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so;\r\n      and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was\r\n      and save himself. And I <i>did</i> start to tell him; but he shut me up,\r\n      and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you reckon I know what I’m about? Don’t\r\n      I generly know what I’m about?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Didn’t I <i>say</i> I was going to help steal the nigger?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Well</i>, then.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That’s all he said, and that’s all I said. It warn’t\r\n      no use to say any more; because when he said he’d do a thing, he\r\n      always done it. But I couldn’t make out how he was willing to\r\n      go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about\r\n      it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn’t help it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\r\n      the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the\r\n      yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn’t\r\n      make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes\r\n      by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the\r\n      front and the two sides; and on the side I warn’t acquainted with—which\r\n      was the north side—we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high,\r\n      with just one stout board nailed across it. I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here’s the ticket. This hole’s big enough for Jim\r\n      to get through if we wrench off the board.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\r\n      playing hooky. I should <i>hope</i> we can find a way that’s a\r\n      little more complicated than <i>that</i>, Huck Finn.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c34-296\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c34-296.jpg (70K)\" src=\"images/c34-296.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-464684353124802207\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then,” I says, “how ’ll it do to saw him\r\n      out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That’s more <i>like</i>,” he says. “It’s\r\n      real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,” he says; “but I\r\n      bet we can find a way that’s twice as long. There ain’t\r\n      no hurry; le’s keep on looking around.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined\r\n      the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as\r\n      the hut, but narrow—only about six foot wide. The door to it\r\n      was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the\r\n      soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift\r\n      the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The\r\n      chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and\r\n      struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn’t\r\n      no connection with it; and there warn’t no floor to the shed, nor\r\n      nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and\r\n      a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in\r\n      the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.\r\n      He says;\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now we’re all right. We’ll <i>dig</i> him out.\r\n      It ’ll take about a week!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door—you only\r\n      have to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don’t fasten the doors—but\r\n      that warn’t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him\r\n      but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way\r\n      about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time\r\n      most busted his brains out, he thought he’d got to give it up; but\r\n      after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck,\r\n      and this time he made the trip.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to\r\n      pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim—if it <i>was</i>\r\n      Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through\r\n      breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim’s nigger was piling\r\n      up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\r\n      leaving, the key come from the house.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all\r\n      tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off.\r\n      He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making\r\n      him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words\r\n      and noises, and he didn’t believe he was ever witched so long before\r\n      in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his\r\n      troubles, he forgot all about what he’d been a-going to do. So\r\n      Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\r\n      heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur’us dog, too. Does you\r\n      want to go en look at ’im?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I hunched Tom, and whispers:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You going, right here in the daybreak? <i>that</i> warn’t\r\n      the plan.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, it warn’t; but it’s the plan <i>now</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So, drat him, we went along, but I didn’t like it much. When\r\n      we got in we couldn’t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim\r\n      was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, <i>Huck</i>! En good <i>lan</i>’! ain’ dat\r\n      Misto Tom?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn’t\r\n      know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn’t a done it, because that\r\n      nigger busted in and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady\r\n      and kind of wondering, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Does <i>who</i> know us?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What <i>put</i> it dar? Didn’ he jis’ dis minute\r\n      sing out like he knowed you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, that’s mighty curious. <i>Who</i> sung out? <i>when</i>\r\n      did he sing out? <i>what</i> did he sing out?” And turns to\r\n      me, perfectly ca’m, and says, “Did <i>you</i> hear anybody\r\n      sing out?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Of course there warn’t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No; I ain’t heard nobody say nothing.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did you sing out?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah,” says Jim; “I hain’t said nothing, sah.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Not a word?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah, I hain’t said a word.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did you ever see us before?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah; not as I knows on.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\r\n      says, kind of severe:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do you reckon’s the matter with you, anyway? What\r\n      made you think somebody sung out?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, it’s de dad-blame’ witches, sah, en I wisht I was\r\n      dead, I do.

If I\r\n      was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn’t\r\n      give him up, I’d hang him.” And whilst the nigger\r\n      stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good,\r\n      he whispers to Jim and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t ever let on to know us.

We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set\r\n      down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can\r\n      be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.\r\n      There ain’t no watchman to be drugged—now there <i>ought</i>\r\n      to be a watchman. There ain’t even a dog to give a\r\n      sleeping-mixture to. And there’s Jim chained by one leg, with\r\n      a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is\r\n      to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he\r\n      trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don’t\r\n      send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that\r\n      window-hole before this, only there wouldn’t be no use trying to\r\n      travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it’s\r\n      the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent <i>all</i> the\r\n      difficulties. Well, we can’t help it; we got to do the best we\r\n      can with the materials we’ve got. Anyhow, there’s one thing—there’s\r\n      more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers,\r\n      where there warn’t one of them furnished to you by the people who it\r\n      was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of\r\n      your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern.\r\n      When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to <i>let on</i>\r\n      that a lantern’s resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight\r\n      procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we\r\n      got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do we want of a saw?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do we <i>want</i> of it? Hain’t we got to saw the\r\n      leg of Jim’s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the\r\n      chain off.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, if that ain’t just like you, Huck Finn. You <i>can</i>\r\n      get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain’t\r\n      you ever read any books at all?—Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor\r\n      Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who\r\n      ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?\r\n      No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in\r\n      two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can’t be\r\n      found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very\r\n      keenest seneskal can’t see no sign of it’s being sawed, and\r\n      thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you’re ready,\r\n      fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you\r\n      are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements,\r\n      shin down it, break your leg in the moat—because a rope ladder is\r\n      nineteen foot too short, you know—and there’s your horses and\r\n      your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle,\r\n      and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It’s\r\n      gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time,\r\n      the night of the escape, we’ll dig one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do we want of a moat when we’re going to snake him out\r\n      from under the cabin?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He\r\n      had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes\r\n      his head; then sighs again, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, it wouldn’t do—there ain’t necessity enough\r\n      for it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “For what?” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, to saw Jim’s leg off,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good land!” I says; “why, there ain’t <i>no</i>\r\n      necessity for it.

They couldn’t\r\n      get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a\r\n      leg would be better still. But we got to let that go. There\r\n      ain’t necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim’s a\r\n      nigger, and wouldn’t understand the reasons for it, and how it’s\r\n      the custom in Europe; so we’ll let it go. But there’s\r\n      one thing—he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and\r\n      make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a\r\n      pie; it’s mostly done that way. And I’ve et worse pies.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,” I says; “Jim ain’t\r\n      got no use for a rope ladder.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He <i>has</i> got use for it. How <i>you</i> talk, you better\r\n      say; you don’t know nothing about it. He’s <i>got</i> to\r\n      have a rope ladder; they all do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What in the nation can he <i>do</i> with it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Do</i> with it? He can hide it in his bed, can’t he?”\r\n      That’s what they all do; and <i>he’s</i> got to, too.\r\n      Huck, you don’t ever seem to want to do anything that’s\r\n      regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S’pose\r\n      he <i>don’t</i> do nothing with it? ain’t it there in his bed,\r\n      for a clew, after he’s gone? and don’t you reckon they’ll\r\n      want clews? Of course they will. And you wouldn’t leave\r\n      them any? That would be a <i>pretty</i> howdy-do, <i>wouldn’t</i>\r\n      it! I never heard of such a thing.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” I says, “if it’s in the regulations, and\r\n      he’s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don’t\r\n      wish to go back on no regulations; but there’s one thing, Tom Sawyer—if\r\n      we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we’re\r\n      going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you’re\r\n      born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don’t\r\n      cost nothing, and don’t waste nothing, and is just as good to load\r\n      up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start;\r\n      and as for Jim, he ain’t had no experience, and so he don’t\r\n      care what kind of a—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I’d keep\r\n      still—that’s what <i>I’d</i> do. Who ever heard of a\r\n      state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it’s\r\n      perfectly ridiculous.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you’ll take\r\n      my advice, you’ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Borrow a shirt, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What do we want of a shirt, Tom?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Journal your granny—<i>Jim</i> can’t write.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “S’pose he <i>can’t</i> write—he can make marks on\r\n      the shirt, can’t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon\r\n      or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a\r\n      better one; and quicker, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Prisoners</i> don’t have geese running around the\r\n      donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They <i>always</i>\r\n      make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old\r\n      brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and\r\n      it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too,\r\n      because they’ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. <i>They</i>\r\n      wouldn’t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain’t regular.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what’ll we make him the ink out of?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that’s the\r\n      common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim\r\n      can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary\r\n      mysterious message to let the world know where he’s captivated, he\r\n      can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of\r\n      the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it’s a blame’ \r\n      good way, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jim ain’t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That ain’t nothing; we can get him some.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Can’t nobody <i>read</i> his plates.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That ain’t got anything to <i>do</i> with it, Huck Finn.\r\n      All <i>he’s</i> got to do is to write on the plate and throw\r\n      it out. You don’t <i>have</i> to be able to read it. Why, half\r\n      the time you can’t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate,\r\n      or anywhere else.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what’s the sense in wasting the plates?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, blame it all, it ain’t the <i>prisoner’s</i>\r\n      plates.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But it’s <i>somebody’s</i> plates, ain’t it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, spos’n it is?

So\r\n      we cleared out for the house.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c35-305\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c35-305.jpg (68K)\" src=\"images/c35-305.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6115795246478939723\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the\r\n      clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down\r\n      and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing,\r\n      because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn’t\r\n      borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners;\r\n      and prisoners don’t care how they get a thing so they get it, and\r\n      nobody don’t blame them for it, either. It ain’t no\r\n      crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom\r\n      said; it’s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a\r\n      prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had\r\n      the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we\r\n      warn’t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but\r\n      a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn’t a prisoner. So\r\n      we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And\r\n      yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon\r\n      out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers\r\n      a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant\r\n      was, we could steal anything we <i>needed</i>. Well, I says, I needed the\r\n      watermelon. But he said I didn’t need it to get out of prison\r\n      with; there’s where the difference was. He said if I’d a\r\n      wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal\r\n      with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I\r\n      couldn’t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to\r\n      set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every\r\n      time I see a chance to hog a watermelon.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled\r\n      down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried\r\n      the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By\r\n      and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk.\r\n      He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Everything’s all right now except tools; and that’s\r\n      easy fixed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tools?” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tools for what?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, to dig with. We ain’t a-going to <i>gnaw</i> him\r\n      out, are we?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ain’t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough\r\n      to dig a nigger out with?” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Huck Finn, did you <i>ever</i> hear of a prisoner having picks and\r\n      shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself\r\n      out with? Now I want to ask you—if you got any reasonableness\r\n      in you at all—what kind of a show would <i>that</i> give him to be a\r\n      hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it.\r\n      Picks and shovels—why, they wouldn’t furnish ’em\r\n      to a king.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then,” I says, “if we don’t want the picks\r\n      and shovels, what do we want?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A couple of case-knives.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Confound it, it’s foolish, Tom.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It don’t make no difference how foolish it is, it’s the\r\n      <i>right</i> way—and it’s the regular way. And there ain’t\r\n      no <i>other</i> way, that ever I heard of, and I’ve read all the\r\n      books that gives any information about these things. They always dig out\r\n      with a case-knife—and not through dirt, mind you; generly it’s\r\n      through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and\r\n      for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom\r\n      dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself\r\n      out that way; how long was <i>he</i> at it, you reckon?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, guess.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know. A month and a half.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Thirty-seven year</i>—and he come out in China. <i>That’s</i>\r\n      the kind. I wish the bottom of <i>this</i> fortress was solid rock.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Jim</i> don’t know nobody in China.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s <i>that</i> got to do with it? Neither did that\r\n      other fellow. But you’re always a-wandering off on a side\r\n      issue. Why can’t you stick to the main point?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right—I don’t care where he comes out, so he <i>comes</i>\r\n      out; and Jim don’t, either, I reckon. But there’s one\r\n      thing, anyway—Jim’s too old to be dug out with a case-knife.\r\n      He won’t last.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes he will <i>last</i>, too. You don’t reckon it’s\r\n      going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a <i>dirt</i>\r\n      foundation, do you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How long will it take, Tom?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, we can’t resk being as long as we ought to, because it\r\n      mayn’t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New\r\n      Orleans. He’ll hear Jim ain’t from there. Then his\r\n      next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we\r\n      can’t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By\r\n      rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can’t.\r\n      Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we\r\n      really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can <i>let on</i>,\r\n      to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can\r\n      snatch him out and rush him away the first time there’s an alarm.\r\n      Yes, I reckon that ’ll be the best way.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now, there’s <i>sense</i> in that,” I says. “Letting\r\n      on don’t cost nothing; letting on ain’t no trouble; and if it’s\r\n      any object, I don’t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty\r\n      year. It wouldn’t strain me none, after I got my hand in.\r\n      So I’ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c35-307\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c35-307.jpg (48K)\" src=\"images/c35-307.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7197854379847311207\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Smouch three,” he says; “we want one to make a saw out\r\n      of.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Tom, if it ain’t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,”\r\n      I says, “there’s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking\r\n      under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.

We cleared everything out of the way,\r\n      about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said\r\n      he was right behind Jim’s bed now, and we’d dig in under it,\r\n      and when we got through there couldn’t nobody in the cabin ever know\r\n      there was any hole there, because Jim’s counter-pin hung down most\r\n      to the ground, and you’d have to raise it up and look under to see\r\n      the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight;\r\n      and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn’t\r\n      see we’d done anything hardly. At last I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “This ain’t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight\r\n      year job, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped\r\n      digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.\r\n      Then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t no use, Huck, it ain’t a-going to work. If\r\n      we was prisoners it would, because then we’d have as many years as\r\n      we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn’t get but a few minutes to\r\n      dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn’t\r\n      get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out,\r\n      and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But <i>we</i> can’t\r\n      fool along; we got to rush; we ain’t got no time to spare. If\r\n      we was to put in another night this way we’d have to knock off for a\r\n      week to let our hands get well—couldn’t touch a case-knife\r\n      with them sooner.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll tell you. It ain’t right, and it ain’t\r\n      moral, and I wouldn’t like it to get out; but there ain’t only\r\n      just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and <i>let\r\n      on</i> it’s case-knives.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Now</i> you’re <i>talking</i>!” I says;\r\n      “your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,”\r\n      I says. “Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don’t\r\n      care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal\r\n      a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain’t no ways\r\n      particular how it’s done so it’s done. What I want is my\r\n      nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my\r\n      Sunday-school book; and if a pick’s the handiest thing, that’s\r\n      the thing I’m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that\r\n      Sunday-school book out with; and I don’t give a dead rat what the\r\n      authorities thinks about it nuther.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well,” he says, “there’s excuse for picks and\r\n      letting-on in a case like this; if it warn’t so, I wouldn’t\r\n      approve of it, nor I wouldn’t stand by and see the rules broke—because\r\n      right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain’t got no business\r\n      doing wrong when he ain’t ignorant and knows better. It might\r\n      answer for <i>you</i> to dig Jim out with a pick, <i>without</i> any\r\n      letting on, because you don’t know no better; but it wouldn’t\r\n      for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gimme a <i>case-knife</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I didn’t know just what to do—but then I thought. I\r\n      scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to\r\n      him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He was always just that particular. Full of principle.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and\r\n      made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as\r\n      long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for\r\n      it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his\r\n      level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn’t come it, his\r\n      hands was so sore. At last he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It ain’t no use, it can’t be done. What you\r\n      reckon I better do? Can’t you think of no way?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes,” I says, “but I reckon it ain’t regular.\r\n      Come up the stairs, and let on it’s a lightning-rod.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he done it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c36-311\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c36-311.jpg (48K)\" src=\"images/c36-311.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-219294435523074981\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,\r\n      for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung\r\n      around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin\r\n      plates. Tom says it wasn’t enough; but I said nobody wouldn’t\r\n      ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they’d fall in the\r\n      dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole—then we could\r\n      tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was\r\n      satisfied. Then he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Take them in through the hole,” I says, “when we get it\r\n      done.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard\r\n      of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he\r\n      said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn’t no need\r\n      to decide on any of them yet. Said we’d got to post Jim first.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one\r\n      of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim\r\n      snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn’t wake him. Then we\r\n      whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the\r\n      job was done. We crept in under Jim’s bed and into the cabin,\r\n      and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim\r\n      awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up\r\n      gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and\r\n      called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for\r\n      having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right\r\n      away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed\r\n      him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our\r\n      plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an\r\n      alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away,\r\n      <i>sure</i>. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and\r\n      talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and\r\n      when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him,\r\n      and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat,\r\n      and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Now</i> I know how to fix it. We’ll send you some\r\n      things by them.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I said, “Don’t do nothing of the kind; it’s one of the\r\n      most jackass ideas I ever struck;” but he never paid no attention to\r\n      me; went right on. It was his way when he’d got his plans set.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he told Jim how we’d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and\r\n      other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\r\n      lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we\r\n      would put small things in uncle’s coat-pockets and he must steal\r\n      them out; and we would tie things to aunt’s apron-strings or put\r\n      them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would\r\n      be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the\r\n      shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he\r\n      couldn’t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white\r\n      folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would\r\n      do it all just as Tom said.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\r\n      sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,\r\n      with hands that looked like they’d been chawed. Tom was in\r\n      high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\r\n      most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\r\n      keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get\r\n      out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more\r\n      he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out\r\n      to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And\r\n      he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\r\n      candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his\r\n      pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat’s\r\n      notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\r\n      corn-pone that was in Jim’s pan, and we went along with Nat to see\r\n      how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\r\n      mashed all his teeth out; and there warn’t ever anything could a\r\n      worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was\r\n      only just a piece of rock or something like that that’s always\r\n      getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but\r\n      what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\r\n      couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim’s bed; and they kept\r\n      on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn’t hardly\r\n      room in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that\r\n      lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered “Witches”\r\n      once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan\r\n      like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of\r\n      Jim’s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out\r\n      himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he’d fixed\r\n      the other door too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and\r\n      petting him, and asking him if he’d been imagining he saw something\r\n      again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mars Sid, you’ll say I’s a fool, but if I didn’t\r\n      b’lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some’n, I\r\n      wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks.

But mos’ly I wisht dey’d lemme\r\n      ’lone, I does.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just\r\n      at this runaway nigger’s breakfast-time? It’s because\r\n      they’re hungry; that’s the reason.

So then we went away and went to the\r\n      rubbage-pile in the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags,\r\n      and pieces of bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and\r\n      scratched around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as\r\n      well as we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it\r\n      full of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of\r\n      shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his\r\n      name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in\r\n      Aunt Sally’s apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t’other\r\n      we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas’s hat, which was on the bureau,\r\n      because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway\r\n      nigger’s house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom\r\n      dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas’s coat-pocket, and Aunt\r\n      Sally wasn’t come yet, so we had to wait a little while.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn’t hardly\r\n      wait for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one\r\n      hand and cracking the handiest child’s head with her thimble with\r\n      the other, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ve hunted high and I’ve hunted low, and it does beat\r\n      all what <i>has</i> become of your other shirt.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard\r\n      piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the\r\n      road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the\r\n      children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry\r\n      out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around\r\n      the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about\r\n      a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out for half\r\n      price if there was a bidder. But after that we was all right again—it\r\n      was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold. Uncle Silas\r\n      he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s most uncommon curious, I can’t understand it.\r\n      I know perfectly well I took it <i>off</i>, because—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Because you hain’t got but one <i>on</i>. Just <i>listen</i>\r\n      at the man! I know you took it off, and know it by a better way than\r\n      your wool-gethering memory, too, because it was on the clo’s-line\r\n      yesterday—I see it there myself. But it’s gone, that’s\r\n      the long and the short of it, and you’ll just have to change to a\r\n      red flann’l one till I can get time to make a new one. And it\r\n      ’ll be the third I’ve made in two years. It just keeps a\r\n      body on the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to <i>do</i>\r\n      with ’m all is more’n I can make out. A body ’d\r\n      think you <i>would</i> learn to take some sort of care of ’em at\r\n      your time of life.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can. But it oughtn’t\r\n      to be altogether my fault, because, you know, I don’t see them nor\r\n      have nothing to do with them except when they’re on me; and I don’t\r\n      believe I’ve ever lost one of them <i>off</i> of me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it ain’t <i>your</i> fault if you haven’t, Silas;\r\n      you’d a done it if you could, I reckon. And the shirt ain’t\r\n      all that’s gone, nuther. Ther’s a spoon gone; and <i>that</i>\r\n      ain’t all. There was ten, and now ther’s only nine. The\r\n      calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon, <i>that’s</i>\r\n      certain.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, what else is gone, Sally?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Ther’s six <i>candles</i> gone—that’s what.\r\n      The rats could a got the candles, and I reckon they did; I wonder\r\n      they don’t walk off with the whole place, the way you’re\r\n      always going to stop their holes and don’t do it; and if they warn’t\r\n      fools they’d sleep in your hair, Silas—<i>you’d</i>\r\n      never find it out; but you can’t lay the <i>spoon</i> on the rats,\r\n      and that I know.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, Sally, I’m in fault, and I acknowledge it; I’ve\r\n      been remiss; but I won’t let to-morrow go by without stopping up\r\n      them holes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, I wouldn’t hurry; next year ’ll do. Matilda\r\n      Angelina Araminta <i>Phelps!</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the\r\n      sugar-bowl without fooling around any. Just then the nigger woman\r\n      steps on to the passage, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Missus, dey’s a sheet gone.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c37-318\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c37-318.jpg (46K)\" src=\"images/c37-318.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4122873014250828003\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A <i>sheet</i> gone! Well, for the land’s sake!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll stop up them holes to-day,” says Uncle Silas,\r\n      looking sorrowful.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, <i>do</i> shet up!—s’pose the rats took the <i>sheet</i>?\r\n      <i>where’s</i> it gone, Lize?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Clah to goodness I hain’t no notion, Miss’ Sally.\r\n      She wuz on de clo’sline yistiddy, but she done gone: she\r\n      ain’ dah no mo’ now.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reckon the world <i>is</i> coming to an end. I <i>never</i>\r\n      see the beat of it in all my born days. A shirt, and a sheet, and a\r\n      spoon, and six can—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Missus,” comes a young yaller wench, “dey’s a\r\n      brass cannelstick miss’n.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Cler out from here, you hussy, er I’ll take a skillet to ye!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, she was just a-biling. I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned\r\n      I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated. She\r\n      kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and\r\n      everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking\r\n      kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket. She\r\n      stopped, with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I\r\n      was in Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s <i>just</i> as I expected. So you had it in your\r\n      pocket all the time; and like as not you’ve got the other things\r\n      there, too. How’d it get there?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I reely don’t know, Sally,” he says, kind of\r\n      apologizing, “or you know I would tell. I was a-studying over\r\n      my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast, and I reckon I put it in\r\n      there, not noticing, meaning to put my Testament in, and it must be so,\r\n      because my Testament ain’t in; but I’ll go and see; and if the\r\n      Testament is where I had it, I’ll know I didn’t put it in, and\r\n      that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon, and—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, for the land’s sake! Give a body a rest! Go\r\n      ’long now, the whole kit and biling of ye; and don’t come nigh\r\n      me again till I’ve got back my peace of mind.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>I’d</i> a heard her if she’d a said it to herself, let\r\n      alone speaking it out; and I’d a got up and obeyed her if I’d\r\n      a been dead. As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he\r\n      took up his hat, and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just\r\n      merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said\r\n      nothing, and went out. Tom see him do it, and remembered about the spoon,\r\n      and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it ain’t no use to send things by <i>him</i> no more,\r\n      he ain’t reliable.” Then he says: “But he done us a good\r\n      turn with the spoon, anyway, without knowing it, and so we’ll go and\r\n      do him one without <i>him</i> knowing it—stop up his rat-holes.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole\r\n      hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape. Then we\r\n      heard steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here\r\n      comes the old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t’other,\r\n      looking as absent-minded as year before last. He went a mooning\r\n      around, first to one rat-hole and then another, till he’d been to\r\n      them all. Then he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off\r\n      of his candle and thinking. Then he turns off slow and dreamy\r\n      towards the stairs, saying:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, for the life of me I can’t remember when I done it.\r\n      I could show her now that I warn’t to blame on account of the\r\n      rats. But never mind—let it go. I reckon it wouldn’t\r\n      do no good.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left. He was a\r\n      mighty nice old man. And always is.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said we’d\r\n      got to have it; so he took a think. When he had ciphered it out he\r\n      told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket\r\n      till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons\r\n      and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and\r\n      Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Aunt Sally, there ain’t but nine spoons <i>yet</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Go ’long to your play, and don’t bother me. I\r\n      know better, I counted ’m myself.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’ve counted them twice, Aunty, and I can’t make\r\n      but nine.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count—anybody\r\n      would.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I declare to gracious ther’ <i>ain’t</i> but nine!”\r\n      she says. “Why, what in the world—plague <i>take</i> the\r\n      things, I’ll count ’m again.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther’s <i>ten</i> now!”\r\n      and she looked huffy and bothered both. But Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Aunty, I don’t think there’s ten.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You numskull, didn’t you see me <i>count ’m?</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I know, but—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I’ll count ’m <i>again</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c37-321\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c37-321.jpg (45K)\" src=\"images/c37-321.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2949856860178342498\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time. Well,\r\n      she <i>was</i> in a tearing way—just a-trembling all over, she was\r\n      so mad. But she counted and counted till she got that addled she’d\r\n      start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times\r\n      they come out right, and three times they come out wrong. Then she\r\n      grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\r\n      galley-west; and she said cle’r out and let her have some peace, and\r\n      if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she’d\r\n      skin us. So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket\r\n      whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right,\r\n      along with her shingle nail, before noon. We was very well satisfied\r\n      with this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it\r\n      took, because he said <i>now</i> she couldn’t ever count them spoons\r\n      twice alike again to save her life; and wouldn’t believe she’d\r\n      counted them right if she <i>did</i>; and said that after she’d\r\n      about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she’d\r\n      give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them\r\n      any more.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her\r\n      closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of\r\n      days till she didn’t know how many sheets she had any more, and she\r\n      didn’t <i>care</i>, and warn’t a-going to bullyrag the rest of\r\n      her soul out about it, and wouldn’t count them again not to save her\r\n      life; she druther die first.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and\r\n      the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\r\n      counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn’t no consequence, it\r\n      would blow over by and by.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie. We\r\n      fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\r\n      done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\r\n      had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we\r\n      got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the\r\n      smoke; because, you see, we didn’t want nothing but a crust, and we\r\n      couldn’t prop it up right, and she would always cave in. But\r\n      of course we thought of the right way at last—which was to cook the\r\n      ladder, too, in the pie. So then we laid in with Jim the second\r\n      night, and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them\r\n      together, and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a\r\n      hung a person with. We let on it took nine months to make it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn’t go\r\n      into the pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\r\n      enough for forty pies if we’d a wanted them, and plenty left over\r\n      for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose. We could a had a whole\r\n      dinner.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c37-322\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c37-322.jpg (33K)\" src=\"images/c37-322.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4522578316402553779\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But we didn’t need it. All we needed was just enough for the\r\n      pie, and so we throwed the rest away. We didn’t cook none of\r\n      the pies in the wash-pan—afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle\r\n      Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of,\r\n      because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that\r\n      come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one\r\n      of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old\r\n      pots and things that was valuable, not on account of being any account,\r\n      because they warn’t, but on account of them being relicts, you know,\r\n      and we snaked her out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on\r\n      the first pies, because we didn’t know how, but she come up smiling\r\n      on the last one. We took and lined her with dough, and set her in\r\n      the coals, and loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and\r\n      shut down the lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot,\r\n      with the long handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she\r\n      turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that\r\n      et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if\r\n      that rope ladder wouldn’t cramp him down to business I don’t\r\n      know nothing what I’m talking about, and lay him in enough\r\n      stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Nat didn’t look when we put the witch pie in Jim’s pan; and we\r\n      put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and\r\n      so Jim got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he\r\n      busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and\r\n      scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c38-324\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c38\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c38-324.jpg (141K)\" src=\"images/c38-324.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8232124795899298139\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Making them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim\r\n      allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all. That’s\r\n      the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall. But he had\r\n      to have it; Tom said he’d <i>got</i> to; there warn’t no case\r\n      of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and\r\n      his coat of arms.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Look at Lady Jane Grey,” he says; “look at Gilford\r\n      Dudley; look at old Northumberland!

By and by he said he’d\r\n      struck so many good ones he didn’t hardly know which to take, but\r\n      there was one which he reckoned he’d decide on. He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “On the scutcheon we’ll have a bend <i>or</i> in the dexter\r\n      base, a saltire <i>murrey</i> in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for\r\n      common charge, and under his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a\r\n      chevron <i>vert</i> in a chief engrailed, and three invected lines on a\r\n      field <i>azure</i>, with the nombril points rampant on a dancette\r\n      indented; crest, a runaway nigger, <i>sable</i>, with his bundle over his\r\n      shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of gules for supporters, which is\r\n      you and me; motto, <i>Maggiore Fretta, Minore Otto.</i> Got it out\r\n      of a book—means the more haste the less speed.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Geewhillikins,” I says, “but what does the rest of it\r\n      mean?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We ain’t got no time to bother over that,” he says;\r\n      “we got to dig in like all git-out.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, anyway,” I says, “what’s <i>some</i> of it?\r\n      What’s a fess?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “A fess—a fess is—<i>you</i> don’t need to know\r\n      what a fess is. I’ll show him how to make it when he gets to\r\n      it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks, Tom,” I says, “I think you might tell a person.\r\n      What’s a bar sinister?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, I don’t know. But he’s got to have it. All\r\n      the nobility does.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      That was just his way. If it didn’t suit him to explain a\r\n      thing to you, he wouldn’t do it. You might pump at him a week,\r\n      it wouldn’t make no difference.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He’d got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in\r\n      to finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a\r\n      mournful inscription—said Jim got to have one, like they all done.\r\n      He made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off,\r\n      so:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      1. Here a captive heart busted. 2. Here a poor prisoner,\r\n      forsook by the world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3. Here\r\n      a lonely heart broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after\r\n      thirty-seven years of solitary captivity. 4. Here, homeless and\r\n      friendless, after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity, perished a noble\r\n      stranger, natural son of Louis XIV.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom’s voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke\r\n      down. When he got done he couldn’t no way make up his mind which one\r\n      for Jim to scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he\r\n      allowed he would let him scrabble them all on. Jim said it would\r\n      take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a\r\n      nail, and he didn’t know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said\r\n      he would block them out for him, and then he wouldn’t have nothing\r\n      to do but just follow the lines. Then pretty soon he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Come to think, the logs ain’t a-going to do; they don’t\r\n      have log walls in a dungeon: we got to dig the inscriptions into a\r\n      rock. We’ll fetch a rock.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such\r\n      a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn’t ever get out.\r\n      But Tom said he would let me help him do it. Then he took a\r\n      look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens. It was\r\n      most pesky tedious hard work and slow, and didn’t give my hands no\r\n      show to get well of the sores, and we didn’t seem to make no\r\n      headway, hardly; so Tom says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I know how to fix it. We got to have a rock for the coat of\r\n      arms and mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same\r\n      rock. There’s a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we’ll\r\n      smouch it, and carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw\r\n      on it, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c38-327\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c38-327.jpg (73K)\" src=\"images/c38-327.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8001228233974121361\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      It warn’t no slouch of an idea; and it warn’t no slouch of a\r\n      grindstone nuther; but we allowed we’d tackle it. It warn’t\r\n      quite midnight yet, so we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.\r\n      We smouched the grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was\r\n      a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn’t\r\n      keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every\r\n      time. Tom said she was going to get one of us, sure, before we got\r\n      through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and\r\n      most drownded with sweat. We see it warn’t no use; we got to\r\n      go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the\r\n      bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through\r\n      our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and\r\n      walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could\r\n      out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Our hole was pretty big, but it warn’t big enough to get the\r\n      grindstone through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.\r\n      Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to\r\n      work on them, with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage\r\n      in the lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his\r\n      candle quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone\r\n      under his straw tick and sleep on it. Then we helped him fix his\r\n      chain back on the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves. But Tom\r\n      thought of something, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You got any spiders in here, Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain’t, Mars Tom.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, we’ll get you some.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But bless you, honey, I doan’ <i>want</i> none. I’s\r\n      afeard un um. I jis’ ’s soon have rattlesnakes aroun’.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom thought a minute or two, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s a good idea. And I reckon it’s been done.\r\n      It <i>must</i> a been done; it stands to reason. Yes, it’s\r\n      a prime good idea. Where could you keep it?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Keep what, Mars Tom?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, a rattlesnake.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom! Why, if dey was a\r\n      rattlesnake to come in heah I’d take en bust right out thoo dat log\r\n      wall, I would, wid my head.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Jim, you wouldn’t be afraid of it after a little. You\r\n      could tame it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Tame</i> it!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes—easy enough. Every animal is grateful for kindness\r\n      and petting, and they wouldn’t <i>think</i> of hurting a person that\r\n      pets them. Any book will tell you that. You try—that’s\r\n      all I ask; just try for two or three days. Why, you can get him so, in a\r\n      little while, that he’ll love you; and sleep with you; and won’t\r\n      stay away from you a minute; and will let you wrap him round your neck and\r\n      put his head in your mouth.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Please</i>, Mars Tom—<i>doan</i>’ talk so! I\r\n      can’t <i>stan</i>’ it! He’d <i>let</i> me shove\r\n      his head in my mouf—fer a favor, hain’t it? I lay he’d\r\n      wait a pow’ful long time ’fo’ I <i>ast</i> him. En\r\n      mo’ en dat, I doan’ <i>want</i> him to sleep wid me.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Jim, don’t act so foolish. A prisoner’s <i>got</i>\r\n      to have some kind of a dumb pet, and if a rattlesnake hain’t ever\r\n      been tried, why, there’s more glory to be gained in your being the\r\n      first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save\r\n      your life.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ <i>want</i> no sich glory. Snake\r\n      take ’n bite Jim’s chin off, den <i>whah</i> is de glory?\r\n      No, sah, I doan’ want no sich doin’s.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Blame it, can’t you <i>try</i>? I only <i>want</i> you\r\n      to try—you needn’t keep it up if it don’t work.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But de trouble all <i>done</i> ef de snake bite me while I’s\r\n      a tryin’ him. Mars Tom, I’s willin’ to tackle mos’ \r\n      anything ’at ain’t onreasonable, but ef you en Huck fetches a\r\n      rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I’s gwyne to <i>leave</i>, dat’s\r\n      <i>shore</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you’re so bull-headed\r\n      about it. We can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some\r\n      buttons on their tails, and let on they’re rattlesnakes, and I\r\n      reckon that ’ll have to do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c38-329\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c38-329.jpg (41K)\" src=\"images/c38-329.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7486939571298672903\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I k’n stan’ <i>dem</i>, Mars Tom, but blame’ \r\n      ’f I couldn’ get along widout um, I tell you dat.

You got\r\n      any rats around here?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, sah, I hain’t seed none.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, we’ll get you some rats.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Mars Tom, I doan’ <i>want</i> no rats.

No, sah, gimme g’yarter-snakes, ’f I’s got to\r\n      have ’m, but doan’ gimme no rats; I hain’ got no use f’r\r\n      um, skasely.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But, Jim, you <i>got</i> to have ’em—they all do.\r\n      So don’t make no more fuss about it. Prisoners ain’t\r\n      ever without rats. There ain’t no instance of it. And\r\n      they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they get to be\r\n      as sociable as flies. But you got to play music to them. You\r\n      got anything to play music on?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I ain’ got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o’ paper,\r\n      en a juice-harp; but I reck’n dey wouldn’ take no stock in a\r\n      juice-harp.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes they would <i>they</i> don’t care what kind of music\r\n      ’tis. A jews-harp’s plenty good enough for a rat. All\r\n      animals like music—in a prison they dote on it. Specially,\r\n      painful music; and you can’t get no other kind out of a jews-harp.\r\n      It always interests them; they come out to see what’s the\r\n      matter with you. Yes, you’re all right; you’re fixed\r\n      very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to\r\n      sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play ‘The\r\n      Last Link is Broken’—that’s the thing that ’ll\r\n      scoop a rat quicker ’n anything else; and when you’ve played\r\n      about two minutes you’ll see all the rats, and the snakes, and\r\n      spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and come. And\r\n      they’ll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, <i>dey</i> will, I reck’n, Mars Tom, but what kine er\r\n      time is <i>Jim</i> havin’? Blest if I kin see de pint. But I’ll\r\n      do it ef I got to. I reck’n I better keep de animals\r\n      satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn’t nothing else;\r\n      and pretty soon he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, there’s one thing I forgot. Could you raise a\r\n      flower here, do you reckon?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it’s tolable\r\n      dark in heah, en I ain’ got no use f’r no flower, nohow, en\r\n      she’d be a pow’ful sight o’ trouble.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you try it, anyway. Some other prisoners has done it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “One er dem big cat-tail-lookin’ mullen-stalks would grow in\r\n      heah, Mars Tom, I reck’n, but she wouldn’t be wuth half de\r\n      trouble she’d coss.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you believe it. We’ll fetch you a little\r\n      one and you plant it in the corner over there, and raise it. And don’t\r\n      call it mullen, call it Pitchiola—that’s its right name when\r\n      it’s in a prison. And you want to water it with your tears.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You don’t <i>want</i> spring water; you want to water it with\r\n      your tears. It’s the way they always do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste\r\n      wid spring water whiles another man’s a <i>start’n</i> one wid\r\n      tears.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c38-331\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c38-331.jpg (36K)\" src=\"images/c38-331.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1537005494234352910\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That ain’t the idea.

But he studied it over, and then said Jim would\r\n      have to worry along the best he could with an onion. He promised he\r\n      would go to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim’s\r\n      coffee-pot, in the morning. Jim said he would “jis’ ’s\r\n      soon have tobacker in his coffee;” and found so much fault with it,\r\n      and with the work and bother of raising the mullen, and jews-harping the\r\n      rats, and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things, on\r\n      top of all the other work he had to do on pens, and inscriptions, and\r\n      journals, and things, which made it more trouble and worry and\r\n      responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook, that Tom\r\n      most lost all patience with him; and said he was just loadened down with\r\n      more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name\r\n      for himself, and yet he didn’t know enough to appreciate them, and\r\n      they was just about wasted on him. So Jim he was sorry, and said he\r\n      wouldn’t behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved for bed.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c39-333\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c39\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c39-333.jpg (161K)\" src=\"images/c39-333.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2386093051944774943\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      In the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and\r\n      fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we\r\n      had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it\r\n      in a safe place under Aunt Sally’s bed. But while we was gone\r\n      for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps\r\n      found it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come\r\n      out, and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she\r\n      was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what\r\n      they could to keep off the dull times for her. So she took and\r\n      dusted us both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching\r\n      another fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn’t\r\n      the likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.\r\n      I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\r\n      caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet’s\r\n      nest, but we didn’t. The family was at home. We didn’t\r\n      give it right up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we\r\n      allowed we’d tire them out or they’d got to tire us out, and\r\n      they done it. Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and\r\n      was pretty near all right again, but couldn’t set down convenient.\r\n      And so we went for the snakes, and grabbed a couple of dozen garters\r\n      and house-snakes, and put them in a bag, and put it in our room, and by\r\n      that time it was supper-time, and a rattling good honest day’s work:\r\n      and hungry?—oh, no, I reckon not! And there warn’t\r\n      a blessed snake up there when we went back—we didn’t half tie\r\n      the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left. But it didn’t\r\n      matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres. So\r\n      we judged we could get some of them again. No, there warn’t no\r\n      real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell. You’d\r\n      see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they\r\n      generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of\r\n      the time where you didn’t want them. Well, they was handsome\r\n      and striped, and there warn’t no harm in a million of them; but that\r\n      never made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed\r\n      what they might, and she couldn’t stand them no way you could fix\r\n      it; and every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn’t make\r\n      no difference what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and\r\n      light out. I never see such a woman. And you could hear her\r\n      whoop to Jericho. You couldn’t get her to take a-holt of one\r\n      of them with the tongs. And if she turned over and found one in bed\r\n      she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was\r\n      afire. She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish\r\n      there hadn’t ever been no snakes created. Why, after every\r\n      last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt\r\n      Sally warn’t over it yet; she warn’t near over it; when she\r\n      was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of\r\n      her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings.\r\n      It was very curious. But Tom said all women was just so.\r\n      He said they was made that way for some reason or other.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she\r\n      allowed these lickings warn’t nothing to what she would do if we\r\n      ever loaded up the place again with them. I didn’t mind the\r\n      lickings, because they didn’t amount to nothing; but I minded the\r\n      trouble we had to lay in another lot. But we got them laid in, and\r\n      all the other things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim’s\r\n      was when they’d all swarm out for music and go for him. Jim\r\n      didn’t like the spiders, and the spiders didn’t like Jim; and\r\n      so they’d lay for him, and make it mighty warm for him. And he\r\n      said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there warn’t\r\n      no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body couldn’t\r\n      sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said, because <i>they</i>\r\n      never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when the snakes was\r\n      asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in the snakes come\r\n      on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his way, and t’other\r\n      gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt a new place the\r\n      spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over. He said if he ever\r\n      got out this time he wouldn’t ever be a prisoner again, not for a\r\n      salary.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.\r\n      The shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim\r\n      he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was\r\n      fresh; the pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the\r\n      grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,\r\n      and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache. We reckoned we was all\r\n      going to die, but didn’t. It was the most undigestible sawdust\r\n      I ever see; and Tom said the same.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c39-335\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c39-335.jpg (36K)\" src=\"images/c39-335.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-8177803651504230195\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But as I was saying, we’d got all the work done now, at last; and we\r\n      was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim. The old man had\r\n      wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get\r\n      their runaway nigger, but hadn’t got no answer, because there warn’t\r\n      no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis\r\n      and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give\r\n      me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn’t no time to lose. So Tom\r\n      said, now for the nonnamous letters.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What’s them?” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Warnings to the people that something is up. Sometimes it’s\r\n      done one way, sometimes another. But there’s always somebody\r\n      spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle. When\r\n      Louis XVI. was going to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done\r\n      it. It’s a very good way, and so is the nonnamous letters.\r\n      We’ll use them both. And it’s usual for the\r\n      prisoner’s mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in, and\r\n      he slides out in her clothes. We’ll do that, too.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But looky here, Tom, what do we want to <i>warn</i> anybody for\r\n      that something’s up? Let them find it out for themselves—it’s\r\n      their lookout.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, I know; but you can’t depend on them. It’s\r\n      the way they’ve acted from the very start—left us to do <i>everything</i>.\r\n      They’re so confiding and mullet-headed they don’t take\r\n      notice of nothing at all. So if we don’t <i>give</i> them\r\n      notice there won’t be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us, and\r\n      so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ’ll go off\r\n      perfectly flat; won’t amount to nothing—won’t be nothing\r\n      <i>to</i> it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, as for me, Tom, that’s the way I’d like.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Shucks!” he says, and looked disgusted. So I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “But I ain’t going to make no complaint. Any way that\r\n      suits you suits me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You’ll be her. You slide in, in the middle of the\r\n      night, and hook that yaller girl’s frock.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, Tom, that ’ll make trouble next morning; because, of\r\n      course, she prob’bly hain’t got any but that one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I know; but you don’t want it but fifteen minutes, to carry\r\n      the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, then, I’ll do it; but I could carry it just as\r\n      handy in my own togs.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You wouldn’t look like a servant-girl <i>then</i>, would you?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, but there won’t be nobody to see what I look like, <i>anyway</i>.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “That ain’t got nothing to do with it. The thing for us\r\n      to do is just to do our <i>duty</i>, and not worry about whether anybody\r\n      <i>sees</i> us do it or not. Hain’t you got no principle at all?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “All right, I ain’t saying nothing; I’m the\r\n      servant-girl. Who’s Jim’s mother?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’m his mother. I’ll hook a gown from Aunt Sally.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, you’ll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim\r\n      leaves.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Not much. I’ll stuff Jim’s clothes full of straw\r\n      and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim ’ll\r\n      take the nigger woman’s gown off of me and wear it, and we’ll\r\n      all evade together. When a prisoner of style escapes it’s\r\n      called an evasion. It’s always called so when a king escapes,\r\n      f’rinstance. And the same with a king’s son; it don’t\r\n      make no difference whether he’s a natural one or an unnatural one.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench’s\r\n      frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\r\n      way Tom told me to. It said:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Beware. Trouble is brewing. Keep a sharp lookout. <i>Unknown</i>\r\n<i>Friend</i>.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c39-337\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c39-337.jpg (69K)\" src=\"images/c39-337.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2170442695603905494\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and\r\n      crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on\r\n      the back door. I never see a family in such a sweat. They\r\n      couldn’t a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts\r\n      laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through\r\n      the air. If a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said “ouch!”\r\n      if anything fell, she jumped and said “ouch!” if you happened\r\n      to touch her, when she warn’t noticing, she done the same; she\r\n      couldn’t face noway and be satisfied, because she allowed there was\r\n      something behind her every time—so she was always a-whirling around\r\n      sudden, and saying “ouch,” and before she’d got\r\n      two-thirds around she’d whirl back again, and say it again; and she\r\n      was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn’t set up. So the thing\r\n      was working very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more\r\n      satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he said, now for the grand bulge! So the very next morning at the\r\n      streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\r\n      better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to\r\n      have a nigger on watch at both doors all night. Tom he went down the\r\n      lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\r\n      and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back. This letter\r\n      said:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Don’t betray me, I wish to be your friend. There is a desprate\r\n      gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your\r\n      runaway nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you\r\n      will stay in the house and not bother them. I am one of the gang,\r\n      but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again,\r\n      and will betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards,\r\n      along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger’s\r\n      cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any\r\n      danger; but stead of that I will <i>baa</i> like a sheep soon as they get\r\n      in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you\r\n      slip there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure. Don’t\r\n      do anything but just the way I am telling you, if you do they will\r\n      suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward\r\n      but to know I have done the right thing. <i>Unknown Friend.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c40-339\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c40\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c40-339.jpg (171K)\" src=\"images/c40-339.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-559890274460527018\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XL.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went\r\n      over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a\r\n      look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper, and\r\n      found them in such a sweat and worry they didn’t know which end they\r\n      was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done\r\n      supper, and wouldn’t tell us what the trouble was, and never let on\r\n      a word about the new letter, but didn’t need to, because we knowed\r\n      as much about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and\r\n      her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good\r\n      lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about\r\n      half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally’s dress that he stole\r\n      and was going to start with the lunch, but says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Where’s the butter?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I laid out a hunk of it,” I says, “on a piece of a\r\n      corn-pone.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, you <i>left</i> it laid out, then—it ain’t here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We can get along without it,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “We can get along <i>with</i> it, too,” he says; “just\r\n      you slide down cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the\r\n      lightning-rod and come along. I’ll go and stuff the straw into Jim’s\r\n      clothes to represent his mother in disguise, and be ready to <i>baa</i>\r\n      like a sheep and shove soon as you get there.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a\r\n      person’s fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of\r\n      corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very\r\n      stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt\r\n      Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat\r\n      on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You been down cellar?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes’m.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What you been doing down there?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Noth’n.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Noth’n!</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No’m.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I don’t know ’m.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You don’t <i>know</i>? Don’t answer me that way.\r\n      Tom, I want to know what you been <i>doing</i> down there.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to\r\n      gracious if I have.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I reckoned she’d let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but\r\n      I s’pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a\r\n      sweat about every little thing that warn’t yard-stick straight; so\r\n      she says, very decided:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.\r\n      You been up to something you no business to, and I lay I’ll\r\n      find out what it is before I’M done with you.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.\r\n      My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of\r\n      them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and\r\n      set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low\r\n      voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they\r\n      warn’t; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off\r\n      their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing\r\n      their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn’t easy\r\n      myself, but I didn’t take my hat off, all the same.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c40-341\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c40-341.jpg (59K)\" src=\"images/c40-341.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5933255017853641121\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if\r\n      she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we’d overdone\r\n      this thing, and what a thundering hornet’s-nest we’d got\r\n      ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear\r\n      out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I <i>couldn’t</i>\r\n      answer them straight, I didn’t know which end of me was up; because\r\n      these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right\r\n      NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn’t but a few\r\n      minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait\r\n      for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions,\r\n      and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that\r\n      scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning\r\n      to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one\r\n      of them says, “I’M for going and getting in the cabin <i>first</i>\r\n      and right <i>now</i>, and catching them when they come,” I most\r\n      dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and\r\n      Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “For the land’s sake, what <i>is</i> the matter with the\r\n      child?

I couldn’t\r\n      hardly get my words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I\r\n      could we must jump for it now, and not a minute to lose—the house\r\n      full of men, yonder, with guns!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      His eyes just blazed; and he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No!—is that so? <i>ain’t</i> it bully! Why,\r\n      Huck, if it was to do over again, I bet I could fetch two hundred! If\r\n      we could put it off till—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hurry! <i>Hurry</i>!” I says. “Where’s\r\n      Jim?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.\r\n      He’s dressed, and everything’s ready. Now we’ll\r\n      slide out and give the sheep-signal.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them\r\n      begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I <i>told</i> you we’d be too soon; they haven’t come—the\r\n      door is locked. Here, I’ll lock some of you into the cabin, and you\r\n      lay for ’em in the dark and kill ’em when they come; and the\r\n      rest scatter around a piece, and listen if you can hear ’em coming.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So in they come, but couldn’t see us in the dark, and most trod on\r\n      us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed. But we got under all\r\n      right, and out through the hole, swift but soft—Jim first, me next,\r\n      and Tom last, which was according to Tom’s orders. Now we was\r\n      in the lean-to, and heard trampings close by outside. So we crept to\r\n      the door, and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but\r\n      couldn’t make out nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he\r\n      would listen for the steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must\r\n      glide out first, and him last. So he set his ear to the crack and\r\n      listened, and listened, and listened, and the steps a-scraping around out\r\n      there all the time; and at last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped\r\n      down, not breathing, and not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy\r\n      towards the fence in Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim\r\n      over it; but Tom’s britches catched fast on a splinter on the top\r\n      rail, and then he hear the steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which\r\n      snapped the splinter and made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and\r\n      started somebody sings out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c40-343\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c40-343.jpg (76K)\" src=\"images/c40-343.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2138557613173760537\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who’s that? Answer, or I’ll shoot!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But we didn’t answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved. Then\r\n      there was a rush, and a <i>Bang, Bang, Bang!</i> and the bullets fairly\r\n      whizzed around us! We heard them sing out:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Here they are! They’ve broke for the river! After\r\n      ’em, boys, and turn loose the dogs!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So here they come, full tilt. We could hear them because they wore\r\n      boots and yelled, but we didn’t wear no boots and didn’t yell.\r\n      We was in the path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to\r\n      us we dodged into the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind\r\n      them. They’d had all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn’t\r\n      scare off the robbers; but by this time somebody had let them loose, and\r\n      here they come, making powwow enough for a million; but they was our dogs;\r\n      so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up; and when they see it\r\n      warn’t nobody but us, and no excitement to offer them, they only\r\n      just said howdy, and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering;\r\n      and then we up-steam again, and whizzed along after them till we was\r\n      nearly to the mill, and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe\r\n      was tied, and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the\r\n      river, but didn’t make no more noise than we was obleeged to. Then\r\n      we struck out, easy and comfortable, for the island where my raft was; and\r\n      we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the\r\n      bank, till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out. And\r\n      when we stepped on to the raft I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Now</i>, old Jim, you’re a free man again, and I bet you\r\n      won’t ever be a slave no more.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck. It ’uz planned\r\n      beautiful, en it ’uz done beautiful; en dey ain’t <i>nobody</i>\r\n      kin git up a plan dat’s mo’ mixed-up en splendid den what dat\r\n      one wuz.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because he\r\n      had a bullet in the calf of his leg.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When me and Jim heard that we didn’t feel so brash as what we did\r\n      before. It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in\r\n      the wigwam and tore up one of the duke’s shirts for to bandage him,\r\n      but he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Gimme the rags; I can do it myself. Don’t stop now; don’t\r\n      fool around here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the\r\n      sweeps, and set her loose! Boys, we done it elegant!—’deed\r\n      we did. I wish <i>we’d</i> a had the handling of Louis XVI.,\r\n      there wouldn’t a been no ‘Son of Saint Louis, ascend to\r\n      heaven!’ wrote down in <i>his</i> biography; no, sir, we’d a\r\n      whooped him over the <i>border</i>—that’s what we’d a\r\n      done with <i>him</i>—and done it just as slick as nothing at all,\r\n      too. Man the sweeps—man the sweeps!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But me and Jim was consulting—and thinking. And after we’d\r\n      thought a minute, I says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Say it, Jim.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz <i>him</i>\r\n      dat ’uz bein’ sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot,\r\n      would he say, ‘Go on en save me, nemmine ’bout a doctor f’r\r\n      to save dis one?’ Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he\r\n      say dat? You <i>bet</i> he wouldn’t! <i>well</i>, den,\r\n      is <i>Jim</i> gywne to say it? No, sah—I doan’ budge a\r\n      step out’n dis place ’dout a <i>doctor</i>, not if it’s\r\n      forty year!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c40-345\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c40-345.jpg (71K)\" src=\"images/c40-345.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-5714083789083126575\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he’d say what he did\r\n      say—so it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a\r\n      doctor. He raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to\r\n      it and wouldn’t budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the\r\n      raft loose himself; but we wouldn’t let him. Then he give us a\r\n      piece of his mind, but it didn’t do no good.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, then, if you’re bound to go, I’ll tell you the\r\n      way to do when you get to the village. Shut the door and blindfold\r\n      the doctor tight and fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave,\r\n      and put a purse full of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all\r\n      around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him\r\n      here in the canoe, in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him\r\n      and take his chalk away from him, and don’t give it back to him till\r\n      you get him back to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can\r\n      find it again. It’s the way they all do.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see\r\n      the doctor coming till he was gone again.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c41-347\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c41\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c41-347.jpg (133K)\" src=\"images/c41-347.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-1041600506185885888\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLI.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\r\n      him up. I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island\r\n      hunting yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and\r\n      about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and\r\n      shot him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not\r\n      say nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home\r\n      this evening and surprise the folks.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Who is your folks?” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The Phelpses, down yonder.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh,” he says. And after a minute, he says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “How’d you say he got shot?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He had a dream,” I says, “and it shot him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Singular dream,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started. But\r\n      when he sees the canoe he didn’t like the look of her—said she\r\n      was big enough for one, but didn’t look pretty safe for two. I\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, you needn’t be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us\r\n      easy enough.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What three?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, me and Sid, and—and—and <i>the guns</i>; that’s\r\n      what I mean.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh,” he says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and\r\n      said he reckoned he’d look around for a bigger one. But they\r\n      was all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\r\n      till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go\r\n      down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to. But I\r\n      said I didn’t; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\r\n      started.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I struck an idea pretty soon. I says to myself, spos’n he can’t\r\n      fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep’s tail, as the saying\r\n      is? spos’n it takes him three or four days? What are we going\r\n      to do?—lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag? No,\r\n      sir; I know what <i>I’ll</i> do. I’ll wait, and when he\r\n      comes back if he says he’s got to go any more I’ll get down\r\n      there, too, if I swim; and we’ll take and tie him, and keep him, and\r\n      shove out down the river; and when Tom’s done with him we’ll\r\n      give him what it’s worth, or all we got, and then let him get\r\n      ashore.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\r\n      waked up the sun was away up over my head! I shot out and went for\r\n      the doctor’s house, but they told me he’d gone away in the\r\n      night some time or other, and warn’t back yet. Well, thinks I,\r\n      that looks powerful bad for Tom, and I’ll dig out for the island\r\n      right off. So away I shoved, and turned the corner, and nearly\r\n      rammed my head into Uncle Silas’s stomach! He says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, <i>Tom!</i> Where you been all this time, you rascal?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c41-348\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c41-348.jpg (58K)\" src=\"images/c41-348.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-6560496911154242098\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I hain’t been nowheres,” I says, “only just\r\n      hunting for the runaway nigger—me and Sid.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, where ever did you go?” he says. “Your aunt’s\r\n      been mighty uneasy.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “She needn’t,” I says, “because we was all right.\r\n      We followed the men and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost\r\n      them; but we thought we heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and\r\n      took out after them and crossed over, but couldn’t find nothing of\r\n      them; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out;\r\n      and tied up the canoe and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an\r\n      hour ago; then we paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid’s at\r\n      the post-office to see what he can hear, and I’m a-branching out to\r\n      get something to eat for us, and then we’re going home.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So then we went to the post-office to get “Sid”; but just as I\r\n      suspicioned, he warn’t there; so the old man he got a letter out of\r\n      the office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn’t come; so the\r\n      old man said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got\r\n      done fooling around—but we would ride. I couldn’t get\r\n      him to let me stay and wait for Sid; and he said there warn’t no use\r\n      in it, and I must come along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried\r\n      both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don’t\r\n      amount to shucks, and said she’d serve Sid the same when he come.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers’ wives, to\r\n      dinner; and such another clack a body never heard. Old Mrs.\r\n      Hotchkiss was the worst; her tongue was a-going all the time. She\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, Sister Phelps, I’ve ransacked that-air cabin over, an’ \r\n      I b’lieve the nigger was crazy.

I hope to gracious if I warn’t afraid they’d\r\n      steal some o’ the family! I was just to that pass I didn’t\r\n      have no reasoning faculties no more. It looks foolish enough <i>now</i>,\r\n      in the daytime; but I says to myself, there’s my two poor boys\r\n      asleep, ’way up stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to\r\n      goodness I was that uneasy ’t I crep’ up there and locked\r\n      ’em in! I <i>did</i>. And anybody would. Because, you\r\n      know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on, and getting\r\n      worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling, and you get\r\n      to doing all sorts o’ wild things, and by and by you think to\r\n      yourself, spos’n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door\r\n      ain’t locked, and you—” She stopped, looking kind of\r\n      wondering, and then she turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit\r\n      on me—I got up and took a walk.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room\r\n      this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little. So\r\n      I done it. But I dasn’t go fur, or she’d a sent for me.\r\n      And when it was late in the day the people all went, and then I come\r\n      in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and “Sid,”\r\n      and the door was locked, and we wanted to see the fun, so we went down the\r\n      lightning-rod, and both of us got hurt a little, and we didn’t never\r\n      want to try <i>that</i> no more. And then I went on and told her all\r\n      what I told Uncle Silas before; and then she said she’d forgive us,\r\n      and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and about what a body might\r\n      expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she\r\n      could see; and so, as long as no harm hadn’t come of it, she judged\r\n      she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she\r\n      had us still, stead of fretting over what was past and done. So then\r\n      she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and dropped into a kind of a\r\n      brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, lawsamercy, it’s most night, and Sid not come yet!\r\n      What <i>has</i> become of that boy?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I see my chance; so I skips up and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I’ll run right up to town and get him,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No you won’t,” she says. “You’ll stay right\r\n      wher’ you are; <i>one’s</i> enough to be lost at a time.\r\n      If he ain’t here to supper, your uncle ’ll go.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, he warn’t there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn’t run across Tom’s\r\n      track. Aunt Sally was a good <i>deal</i> uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said\r\n      there warn’t no occasion to be—boys will be boys, he said, and\r\n      you’ll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right.\r\n      So she had to be satisfied. But she said she’d set up\r\n      for him a while anyway, and keep a light burning so he could see it.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c41-353\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c41-353.jpg (41K)\" src=\"images/c41-353.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-11598769997649283\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle,\r\n      and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I couldn’t\r\n      look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a\r\n      long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn’t seem to\r\n      want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now and then\r\n      if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded, and might\r\n      be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she not by him\r\n      to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I would tell her\r\n      that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning, sure; and she\r\n      would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say it again, and\r\n      keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in so much\r\n      trouble. And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so\r\n      steady and gentle, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The door ain’t going to be locked, Tom, and there’s the\r\n      window and the rod; but you’ll be good, <i>won’t</i> you?\r\n      And you won’t go?

And the third time I waked up at\r\n      dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out,\r\n      and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c42-355\"></a><br> <br> <a id=\"c42\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c42-355.jpg (151K)\" src=\"images/c42-355.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7233723767874707021\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> CHAPTER XLII.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      The old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn’t get no\r\n      track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying\r\n      nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not\r\n      eating anything. And by and by the old man says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Did I give you the letter?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What letter?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “No, you didn’t give me no letter.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I must a forgot it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid\r\n      it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, it’s from St. Petersburg—it’s from Sis.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn’t stir. But\r\n      before she could break it open she dropped it and run—for she see\r\n      something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old\r\n      doctor; and Jim, in <i>her</i> calico dress, with his hands tied behind\r\n      him; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing\r\n      that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, he’s dead, he’s dead, I know he’s dead!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,\r\n      which showed he warn’t in his right mind; then she flung up her\r\n      hands, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “He’s alive, thank God! And that’s enough!”\r\n      and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed\r\n      ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody\r\n      else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old\r\n      doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men\r\n      was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all\r\n      the other niggers around there, so they wouldn’t be trying to run\r\n      away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole\r\n      family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others\r\n      said, don’t do it, it wouldn’t answer at all; he ain’t\r\n      our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure.\r\n      So that cooled them down a little, because the people that’s\r\n      always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain’t done just\r\n      right is always the very ones that ain’t the most anxious to pay for\r\n      him when they’ve got their satisfaction out of him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the\r\n      head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to\r\n      know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on\r\n      him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big\r\n      staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both\r\n      legs, and said he warn’t to have nothing but bread and water to eat\r\n      after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn’t\r\n      come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a\r\n      couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every\r\n      night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time\r\n      they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl\r\n      good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and\r\n      says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t be no rougher on him than you’re obleeged to,\r\n      because he ain’t a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the\r\n      boy I see I couldn’t cut the bullet out without some help, and he\r\n      warn’t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he\r\n      got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out\r\n      of his head, and wouldn’t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said\r\n      if I chalked his raft he’d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness\r\n      like that, and I see I couldn’t do anything at all with him; so I\r\n      says, I got to have <i>help</i> somehow; and the minute I says it out\r\n      crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he’ll help, and he done\r\n      it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a\r\n      runaway nigger, and there I <i>was</i>! and there I had to stick right\r\n      straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix,\r\n      I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I’d\r\n      of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn’t, because the\r\n      nigger might get away, and then I’d be to blame; and yet never a\r\n      skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick\r\n      plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a\r\n      better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it,\r\n      and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he’d been worked\r\n      main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you,\r\n      gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars—and kind\r\n      treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as\r\n      well there as he would a done at home—better, maybe, because it was\r\n      so quiet; but there I <i>was</i>, with both of ’m on my hands, and\r\n      there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a\r\n      skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by\r\n      the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned\r\n      them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him\r\n      before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the\r\n      boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and\r\n      hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the\r\n      nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He\r\n      ain’t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that’s what I think about him.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c42-357\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c42-357.jpg (55K)\" src=\"images/c42-357.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-7179024353527803264\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Somebody says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I’m obleeged to say.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to\r\n      that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was\r\n      according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good\r\n      heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they\r\n      all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some\r\n      notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right\r\n      out and hearty, that they wouldn’t cuss him no more.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say\r\n      he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten\r\n      heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\r\n      didn’t think of it, and I reckoned it warn’t best for me to\r\n      mix in, but I judged I’d get the doctor’s yarn to Aunt Sally\r\n      somehow or other as soon as I’d got through the breakers that was\r\n      laying just ahead of me—explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to\r\n      mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that\r\n      dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day\r\n      and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged\r\n      him.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally\r\n      was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found\r\n      him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would\r\n      wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not\r\n      fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for\r\n      him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and\r\n      there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set\r\n      down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now,\r\n      because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he’d been sleeping like\r\n      that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time,\r\n      and ten to one he’d wake up in his right mind.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his\r\n      eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Hello!—why, I’m at <i>home</i>! How’s that?\r\n      Where’s the raft?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “It’s all right,” I says.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “And <i>Jim</i>?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “The same,” I says, but couldn’t say it pretty brash.\r\n      But he never noticed, but says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good! Splendid! <i>Now</i> we’re all right and\r\n      safe! Did you tell Aunty?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: “About what,\r\n      Sid?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, about the way the whole thing was done.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What whole thing?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, <i>the</i> whole thing. There ain’t but one; how\r\n      we set the runaway nigger free—me and Tom.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Good land! Set the run—What <i>is</i> the child talking\r\n      about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>No</i>, I ain’t out of my <i>head</i>; I know all what I’m\r\n      talking about. We <i>did</i> set him free—me and Tom. We\r\n      laid out to do it, and we <i>done</i> it. And we done it elegant,\r\n      too.” He’d got a start, and she never checked him up,\r\n      just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn’t\r\n      no use for <i>me</i> to put in. “Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of\r\n      work—weeks of it—hours and hours, every night, whilst you was\r\n      all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and\r\n      your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the\r\n      warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and\r\n      you can’t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and\r\n      inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can’t think <i>half</i>\r\n      the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and\r\n      things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the\r\n      lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder\r\n      and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work\r\n      with in your apron pocket—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Mercy sakes!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “—and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for\r\n      company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his\r\n      hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come\r\n      before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and\r\n      let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let\r\n      them go by, and when the dogs come they warn’t interested in us, but\r\n      went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and\r\n      was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and\r\n      <i>wasn’t</i> it bully, Aunty!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So\r\n      it was <i>you</i>, you little rapscallions, that’s been making all\r\n      this trouble, and turned everybody’s wits clean inside out and\r\n      scared us all most to death. I’ve as good a notion as ever I\r\n      had in my life to take it out o’ you this very minute. To\r\n      think, here I’ve been, night after night, a—<i>you</i> just\r\n      get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I’ll tan the Old Harry out\r\n      o’ both o’ ye!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      But Tom, he <i>was</i> so proud and joyful, he just <i>couldn’t</i>\r\n      hold in, and his tongue just <i>went</i> it—she a-chipping in, and\r\n      spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat\r\n      convention; and she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Well</i>, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it <i>now</i>,\r\n      for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again—”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Meddling with <i>who</i>?” Tom says, dropping his smile\r\n      and looking surprised.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “With <i>who</i>? Why, the runaway nigger, of course.

They’ve got him back, safe\r\n      and sound, and he’s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and\r\n      loaded down with chains, till he’s claimed or sold!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c42-361\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c42-361.jpg (33K)\" src=\"images/c42-361.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-2918715363089929837\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and\r\n      shutting like gills, and sings out to me:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “They hain’t no <i>right</i> to shut him up! SHOVE!—and\r\n      don’t you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain’t no\r\n      slave; he’s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What <i>does</i> the child mean?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “I mean every word I <i>say</i>, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don’t\r\n      go, <i>I’ll</i> go. I’ve knowed him all his life, and so has\r\n      Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed\r\n      she ever was going to sell him down the river, and <i>said</i> so; and she\r\n      set him free in her will.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Then what on earth did <i>you</i> want to set him free for, seeing\r\n      he was already free?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, that <i>is</i> a question, I must say; and just like women!\r\n      Why, I wanted the <i>adventure</i> of it; and I’d a waded\r\n      neck-deep in blood to—goodness alive, <i>Aunt Polly!</i>”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      If she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as\r\n      sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried\r\n      over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was\r\n      getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in\r\n      a little while Tom’s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there\r\n      looking across at Tom over her spectacles—kind of grinding him into\r\n      the earth, you know. And then she says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Yes, you <i>better</i> turn y’r head away—I would if I\r\n      was you, Tom.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Oh, deary me!” says Aunt Sally; “<i>Is</i> he changed\r\n      so? Why, that ain’t <i>Tom</i>, it’s Sid; Tom’s—Tom’s—why,\r\n      where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You mean where’s Huck <i>Finn</i>—that’s what you\r\n      mean! I reckon I hain’t raised such a scamp as my Tom all\r\n      these years not to know him when I <i>see</i> him. That <i>would</i>\r\n      be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      So I done it. But not feeling brash.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see—except\r\n      one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to\r\n      him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t\r\n      know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting\r\n      sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest\r\n      man in the world couldn’t a understood it. So Tom’s Aunt\r\n      Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell\r\n      how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom\r\n      Sawyer—she chipped in and says, “Oh, go on and call me Aunt\r\n      Sally, I’m used to it now, and ’tain’t no need to change”—that\r\n      when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it—there warn’t\r\n      no other way, and I knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be\r\n      nuts for him, being a mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it,\r\n      and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to\r\n      be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting\r\n      Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took\r\n      all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn’t\r\n      ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he <i>could</i>\r\n      help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and\r\n      <i>Sid</i> had come all right and safe, she says to herself:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go\r\n      off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and\r\n      trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what\r\n      that creetur’s up to <i>this</i> time, as long as I couldn’t\r\n      seem to get any answer out of you about it.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Why, I never heard nothing from you,” says Aunt Sally.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you\r\n      could mean by Sid being here.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well, I never got ’em, Sis.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “You, Tom!”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Well—<i>what</i>?” he says, kind of pettish.\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “Don’t you what <i>me</i>, you impudent thing—hand out\r\n      them letters.”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br> <br> <a id=\"c42-362\"></a><br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:60%\">\r\n<img alt=\"c42-362.jpg (27K)\" src=\"images/c42-362.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;\" id=\"id-4360073999323420842\"><br>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n<br> <br> <br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “What letters?”\r\n    </p>\r\n<p>\r\n      “<i>Them</i> letters.

John Hathorne (as the name was then spelled), the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Nathaniel Hawthorne, was a magistrate at Salem in the\r\nlatter part of the seventeenth century, and officiated at the famous trials for\r\nwitchcraft held there. It is of record that he used peculiar severity towards a\r\ncertain woman who was among the accused; and the husband of this woman\r\nprophesied that God would take revenge upon his wife’s persecutors. This\r\ncircumstance doubtless furnished a hint for that piece of tradition in the book\r\nwhich represents a Pyncheon of a former generation as having persecuted one\r\nMaule, who declared that God would give his enemy “blood to drink.”\r\nIt became a conviction with the Hawthorne family that a curse had been\r\npronounced upon its members, which continued in force in the time of the\r\nromancer; a conviction perhaps derived from the recorded prophecy of the\r\ninjured woman’s husband, just mentioned; and, here again, we have a\r\ncorrespondence with Maule’s malediction in the story. Furthermore, there\r\noccurs in the “American Note-Books” (August 27, 1837), a\r\nreminiscence of the author’s family, to the following effect. Philip\r\nEnglish, a character well-known in early Salem annals, was among those who\r\nsuffered from John Hathorne’s magisterial harshness, and he maintained in\r\nconsequence a lasting feud with the old Puritan official. But at his death\r\nEnglish left daughters, one of whom is said to have married the son of Justice\r\nJohn Hathorne, whom English had declared he would never forgive. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to point out how clearly this foreshadows the final union of those\r\nhereditary foes, the Pyncheons and Maules, through the marriage of Phœbe and\r\nHolgrave. The romance, however, describes the Maules as possessing some of the\r\ntraits known to have been characteristic of the Hawthornes: for example,\r\n“so long as any of the race were to be found, they had been marked out\r\nfrom other men—not strikingly, nor as with a sharp line, but with an\r\neffect that was felt rather than spoken of—by an hereditary\r\ncharacteristic of reserve.” Thus, while the general suggestion of the\r\nHawthorne line and its fortunes was followed in the romance, the Pyncheons\r\ntaking the place of the author’s family, certain distinguishing marks of\r\nthe Hawthornes were assigned to the imaginary Maule posterity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are one or two other points which indicate Hawthorne’s method of\r\nbasing his compositions, the result in the main of pure invention, on the solid\r\nground of particular facts. Allusion is made, in the first chapter of the\r\n“Seven Gables,” to a grant of lands in Waldo County, Maine, owned\r\nby the Pyncheon family. In the “American Note-Books” there is an\r\nentry, dated August 12, 1837, which speaks of the Revolutionary general, Knox,\r\nand his land-grant in Waldo County, by virtue of which the owner had hoped to\r\nestablish an estate on the English plan, with a tenantry to make it profitable\r\nfor him. An incident of much greater importance in the story is the supposed\r\nmurder of one of the Pyncheons by his nephew, to whom we are introduced as\r\nClifford Pyncheon. In all probability Hawthorne connected with this, in his\r\nmind, the murder of Mr. White, a wealthy gentleman of Salem, killed by a man\r\nwhom his nephew had hired. This took place a few years after Hawthorne’s\r\ngraduation from college, and was one of the celebrated cases of the day, Daniel\r\nWebster taking part prominently in the trial. But it should be observed here\r\nthat such resemblances as these between sundry elements in the work of\r\nHawthorne’s fancy and details of reality are only fragmentary, and are\r\nrearranged to suit the author’s purposes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the same way he has made his description of Hepzibah Pyncheon’s\r\nseven-gabled mansion conform so nearly to several old dwellings formerly or\r\nstill extant in Salem, that strenuous efforts have been made to fix upon some\r\none of them as the veritable edifice of the romance. A paragraph in the opening\r\nchapter has perhaps assisted this delusion that there must have been a single\r\noriginal House of the Seven Gables, framed by flesh-and-blood carpenters; for\r\nit runs thus:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Familiar as it stands in the writer’s recollection—for it\r\nhas been an object of curiosity with him from boyhood, both as a specimen of\r\nthe best and stateliest architecture of a long-past epoch, and as the scene of\r\nevents more full of interest perhaps than those of a gray feudal\r\ncastle—familiar as it stands, in its rusty old age, it is therefore only\r\nthe more difficult to imagine the bright novelty with which it first caught the\r\nsunshine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHundreds of pilgrims annually visit a house in Salem, belonging to one branch\r\nof the Ingersoll family of that place, which is stoutly maintained to have been\r\nthe model for Hawthorne’s visionary dwelling. Others have supposed that\r\nthe now vanished house of the identical Philip English, whose blood, as we have\r\nalready noticed, became mingled with that of the Hawthornes, supplied the\r\npattern; and still a third building, known as the Curwen mansion, has been\r\ndeclared the only genuine establishment. Notwithstanding persistent popular\r\nbelief, the authenticity of all these must positively be denied; although it is\r\npossible that isolated reminiscences of all three may have blended with the\r\nideal image in the mind of Hawthorne. He, it will be seen, remarks in the\r\nPreface, alluding to himself in the third person, that he trusts not to be\r\ncondemned for “laying out a street that infringes upon nobody’s\r\nprivate rights... and building a house of materials long in use for\r\nconstructing castles in the air.” More than this, he stated to persons\r\nstill living that the house of the romance was not copied from any actual\r\nedifice, but was simply a general reproduction of a style of architecture\r\nbelonging to colonial days, examples of which survived into the period of his\r\nyouth, but have since been radically modified or destroyed. Here, as elsewhere,\r\nhe exercised the liberty of a creative mind to heighten the probability of his\r\npictures without confining himself to a literal description of something he had\r\nseen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile Hawthorne remained at Lenox, and during the composition of this romance,\r\nvarious other literary personages settled or stayed for a time in the vicinity;\r\namong them, Herman Melville, whose intercourse Hawthorne greatly enjoyed, Henry\r\nJames, Sr., Doctor Holmes, J. T. Headley, James Russell Lowell, Edwin P.\r\nWhipple, Frederika Bremer, and J. T. Fields; so that there was no lack of\r\nintellectual society in the midst of the beautiful and inspiring mountain\r\nscenery of the place. “In the afternoons, nowadays,” he records,\r\nshortly before beginning the work, “this valley in which I dwell seems\r\nlike a vast basin filled with golden Sunshine as with wine;” and, happy\r\nin the companionship of his wife and their three children, he led a simple,\r\nrefined, idyllic life, despite the restrictions of a scanty and uncertain\r\nincome. A letter written by Mrs. Hawthorne, at this time, to a member of her\r\nfamily, gives incidentally a glimpse of the scene, which may properly find a\r\nplace here. She says: “I delight to think that you also can look forth,\r\nas I do now, upon a broad valley and a fine amphitheater of hills, and are\r\nabout to watch the stately ceremony of the sunset from your piazza. But you\r\nhave not this lovely lake, nor, I suppose, the delicate purple mist which folds\r\nthese slumbering mountains in airy veils. Mr. Hawthorne has been lying down in\r\nthe sun shine, slightly fleckered with the shadows of a tree, and Una and\r\nJulian have been making him look like the mighty Pan, by covering his chin and\r\nbreast with long grass-blades, that looked like a verdant and venerable\r\nbeard.” The pleasantness and peace of his surroundings and of his modest\r\nhome, in Lenox, may be taken into account as harmonizing with the mellow\r\nserenity of the romance then produced. Of the work, when it appeared in the\r\nearly spring of 1851, he wrote to Horatio Bridge these words, now published for\r\nthe first time:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘The House of the Seven Gables’ in my opinion, is better\r\nthan ‘The Scarlet Letter:’ but I should not wonder if I had refined\r\nupon the principal character a little too much for popular appreciation, nor if\r\nthe romance of the book should be somewhat at odds with the humble and familiar\r\nscenery in which I invest it. But I feel that portions of it are as good as\r\nanything I can hope to write, and the publisher speaks encouragingly of its\r\nsuccess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom England, especially, came many warm expressions of praise,—a fact\r\nwhich Mrs. Hawthorne, in a private letter, commented on as the fulfillment of a\r\npossibility which Hawthorne, writing in boyhood to his mother, had looked\r\nforward to. He had asked her if she would not like him to become an author and\r\nhave his books read in England.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nG. P. L.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"pref02\"></a>PREFACE.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observed that he\r\nwishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which\r\nhe would not have felt himself entitled to assume had he professed to be\r\nwriting a Novel. The latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very\r\nminute fidelity, not merely to the possible, but to the probable and ordinary\r\ncourse of man’s experience. The former—while, as a work of art, it\r\nmust rigidly subject itself to laws, and while it sins unpardonably so far as\r\nit may swerve aside from the truth of the human heart—has fairly a right\r\nto present that truth under circumstances, to a great extent, of the\r\nwriter’s own choosing or creation. If he think fit, also, he may so\r\nmanage his atmospherical medium as to bring out or mellow the lights and deepen\r\nand enrich the shadows of the picture. He will be wise, no doubt, to make a\r\nvery moderate use of the privileges here stated, and, especially, to mingle the\r\nMarvelous rather as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavor, than as any\r\nportion of the actual substance of the dish offered to the public. He can\r\nhardly be said, however, to commit a literary crime even if he disregard this\r\ncaution.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the present work, the author has proposed to himself—but with what\r\nsuccess, fortunately, it is not for him to judge—to keep undeviatingly\r\nwithin his immunities. The point of view in which this tale comes under the\r\nRomantic definition lies in the attempt to connect a bygone time with the very\r\npresent that is flitting away from us. It is a legend prolonging itself, from\r\nan epoch now gray in the distance, down into our own broad daylight, and\r\nbringing along with it some of its legendary mist, which the reader, according\r\nto his pleasure, may either disregard, or allow it to float almost\r\nimperceptibly about the characters and events for the sake of a picturesque\r\neffect. The narrative, it may be, is woven of so humble a texture as to require\r\nthis advantage, and, at the same time, to render it the more difficult of\r\nattainment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMany writers lay very great stress upon some definite moral purpose, at which\r\nthey profess to aim their works. Not to be deficient in this particular, the\r\nauthor has provided himself with a moral,—the truth, namely, that the\r\nwrong-doing of one generation lives into the successive ones, and, divesting\r\nitself of every temporary advantage, becomes a pure and uncontrollable\r\nmischief; and he would feel it a singular gratification if this romance might\r\neffectually convince mankind—or, indeed, any one man—of the folly\r\nof tumbling down an avalanche of ill-gotten gold, or real estate, on the heads\r\nof an unfortunate posterity, thereby to maim and crush them, until the\r\naccumulated mass shall be scattered abroad in its original atoms. In good\r\nfaith, however, he is not sufficiently imaginative to flatter himself with the\r\nslightest hope of this kind. When romances do really teach anything, or produce\r\nany effective operation, it is usually through a far more subtile process than\r\nthe ostensible one. The author has considered it hardly worth his while,\r\ntherefore, relentlessly to impale the story with its moral as with an iron\r\nrod,—or, rather, as by sticking a pin through a butterfly,—thus at\r\nonce depriving it of life, and causing it to stiffen in an ungainly and\r\nunnatural attitude. A high truth, indeed, fairly, finely, and skilfully wrought\r\nout, brightening at every step, and crowning the final development of a work of\r\nfiction, may add an artistic glory, but is never any truer, and seldom any more\r\nevident, at the last page than at the first.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe reader may perhaps choose to assign an actual locality to the imaginary\r\nevents of this narrative. If permitted by the historical\r\nconnection,—which, though slight, was essential to his plan,—the\r\nauthor would very willingly have avoided anything of this nature. Not to speak\r\nof other objections, it exposes the romance to an inflexible and exceedingly\r\ndangerous species of criticism, by bringing his fancy-pictures almost into\r\npositive contact with the realities of the moment. It has been no part of his\r\nobject, however, to describe local manners, nor in any way to meddle with the\r\ncharacteristics of a community for whom he cherishes a proper respect and a\r\nnatural regard. He trusts not to be considered as unpardonably offending by\r\nlaying out a street that infringes upon nobody’s private rights, and\r\nappropriating a lot of land which had no visible owner, and building a house of\r\nmaterials long in use for constructing castles in the air. The personages of\r\nthe tale—though they give themselves out to be of ancient stability and\r\nconsiderable prominence—are really of the author’s own making, or\r\nat all events, of his own mixing; their virtues can shed no lustre, nor their\r\ndefects redound, in the remotest degree, to the discredit of the venerable town\r\nof which they profess to be inhabitants. He would be glad, therefore,\r\nif—especially in the quarter to which he alludes—the book may be\r\nread strictly as a Romance, having a great deal more to do with the clouds\r\noverhead than with any portion of the actual soil of the County of Essex.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\nL<small>ENOX</small>, January 27, 1851.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2>THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES</h2>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap01\"></a>I.<br>\r\nThe Old Pyncheon Family</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nHalfway down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty wooden\r\nhouse, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various points of the\r\ncompass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst. The street is Pyncheon\r\nStreet; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an elm-tree, of wide\r\ncircumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to every town-born child by\r\nthe title of the Pyncheon Elm. On my occasional visits to the town aforesaid, I\r\nseldom failed to turn down Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through the\r\nshadow of these two antiquities,—the great elm-tree and the\r\nweather-beaten edifice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human\r\ncountenance, bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and sunshine, but\r\nexpressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, and accompanying\r\nvicissitudes that have passed within. Were these to be worthily recounted, they\r\nwould form a narrative of no small interest and instruction, and possessing,\r\nmoreover, a certain remarkable unity, which might almost seem the result of\r\nartistic arrangement. But the story would include a chain of events extending\r\nover the better part of two centuries, and, written out with reasonable\r\namplitude, would fill a bigger folio volume, or a longer series of duodecimos,\r\nthan could prudently be appropriated to the annals of all New England during a\r\nsimilar period. It consequently becomes imperative to make short work with most\r\nof the traditionary lore of which the old Pyncheon House, otherwise known as\r\nthe House of the Seven Gables, has been the theme. With a brief sketch,\r\ntherefore, of the circumstances amid which the foundation of the house was\r\nlaid, and a rapid glimpse at its quaint exterior, as it grew black in the\r\nprevalent east wind,—pointing, too, here and there, at some spot of more\r\nverdant mossiness on its roof and walls,—we shall commence the real\r\naction of our tale at an epoch not very remote from the present day. Still,\r\nthere will be a connection with the long past—a reference to forgotten\r\nevents and personages, and to manners, feelings, and opinions, almost or wholly\r\nobsolete—which, if adequately translated to the reader, would serve to\r\nillustrate how much of old material goes to make up the freshest novelty of\r\nhuman life. Hence, too, might be drawn a weighty lesson from the\r\nlittle-regarded truth, that the act of the passing generation is the germ which\r\nmay and must produce good or evil fruit in a far-distant time; that, together\r\nwith the seed of the merely temporary crop, which mortals term expediency, they\r\ninevitably sow the acorns of a more enduring growth, which may darkly\r\novershadow their posterity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe House of the Seven Gables, antique as it now looks, was not the first\r\nhabitation erected by civilized man on precisely the same spot of ground.\r\nPyncheon Street formerly bore the humbler appellation of Maule’s Lane,\r\nfrom the name of the original occupant of the soil, before whose cottage-door\r\nit was a cow-path. A natural spring of soft and pleasant water—a rare\r\ntreasure on the sea-girt peninsula where the Puritan settlement was\r\nmade—had early induced Matthew Maule to build a hut, shaggy with thatch,\r\nat this point, although somewhat too remote from what was then the centre of\r\nthe village. In the growth of the town, however, after some thirty or forty\r\nyears, the site covered by this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in\r\nthe eyes of a prominent and powerful personage, who asserted plausible claims\r\nto the proprietorship of this and a large adjacent tract of land, on the\r\nstrength of a grant from the legislature. Colonel Pyncheon, the claimant, as we\r\ngather from whatever traits of him are preserved, was characterized by an iron\r\nenergy of purpose. Matthew Maule, on the other hand, though an obscure man, was\r\nstubborn in the defence of what he considered his right; and, for several\r\nyears, he succeeded in protecting the acre or two of earth which, with his own\r\ntoil, he had hewn out of the primeval forest, to be his garden ground and\r\nhomestead. No written record of this dispute is known to be in existence. Our\r\nacquaintance with the whole subject is derived chiefly from tradition. It would\r\nbe bold, therefore, and possibly unjust, to venture a decisive opinion as to\r\nits merits; although it appears to have been at least a matter of doubt,\r\nwhether Colonel Pyncheon’s claim were not unduly stretched, in order to\r\nmake it cover the small metes and bounds of Matthew Maule. What greatly\r\nstrengthens such a suspicion is the fact that this controversy between two\r\nill-matched antagonists—at a period, moreover, laud it as we may, when\r\npersonal influence had far more weight than now—remained for years\r\nundecided, and came to a close only with the death of the party occupying the\r\ndisputed soil. The mode of his death, too, affects the mind differently, in our\r\nday, from what it did a century and a half ago. It was a death that blasted\r\nwith strange horror the humble name of the dweller in the cottage, and made it\r\nseem almost a religious act to drive the plough over the little area of his\r\nhabitation, and obliterate his place and memory from among men.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOld Matthew Maule, in a word, was executed for the crime of witchcraft. He was\r\none of the martyrs to that terrible delusion, which should teach us, among its\r\nother morals, that the influential classes, and those who take upon themselves\r\nto be leaders of the people, are fully liable to all the passionate error that\r\nhas ever characterized the maddest mob. Clergymen, judges, statesmen,—the\r\nwisest, calmest, holiest persons of their day stood in the inner circle round\r\nabout the gallows, loudest to applaud the work of blood, latest to confess\r\nthemselves miserably deceived. If any one part of their proceedings can be said\r\nto deserve less blame than another, it was the singular indiscrimination with\r\nwhich they persecuted, not merely the poor and aged, as in former judicial\r\nmassacres, but people of all ranks; their own equals, brethren, and wives. Amid\r\nthe disorder of such various ruin, it is not strange that a man of\r\ninconsiderable note, like Maule, should have trodden the martyr’s path to\r\nthe hill of execution almost unremarked in the throng of his fellow sufferers.\r\nBut, in after days, when the frenzy of that hideous epoch had subsided, it was\r\nremembered how loudly Colonel Pyncheon had joined in the general cry, to purge\r\nthe land from witchcraft; nor did it fail to be whispered, that there was an\r\ninvidious acrimony in the zeal with which he had sought the condemnation of\r\nMatthew Maule. It was well known that the victim had recognized the bitterness\r\nof personal enmity in his persecutor’s conduct towards him, and that he\r\ndeclared himself hunted to death for his spoil. At the moment of\r\nexecution—with the halter about his neck, and while Colonel Pyncheon sat\r\non horseback, grimly gazing at the scene Maule had addressed him from the\r\nscaffold, and uttered a prophecy, of which history, as well as fireside\r\ntradition, has preserved the very words. “God,” said the dying man,\r\npointing his finger, with a ghastly look, at the undismayed countenance of his\r\nenemy,—“God will give him blood to drink!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the reputed wizard’s death, his humble homestead had fallen an easy\r\nspoil into Colonel Pyncheon’s grasp. When it was understood, however,\r\nthat the Colonel intended to erect a family mansion—spacious, ponderously\r\nframed of oaken timber, and calculated to endure for many generations of his\r\nposterity over the spot first covered by the log-built hut of Matthew Maule,\r\nthere was much shaking of the head among the village gossips. Without\r\nabsolutely expressing a doubt whether the stalwart Puritan had acted as a man\r\nof conscience and integrity throughout the proceedings which have been\r\nsketched, they, nevertheless, hinted that he was about to build his house over\r\nan unquiet grave. His home would include the home of the dead and buried\r\nwizard, and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of privilege to\r\nhaunt its new apartments, and the chambers into which future bridegrooms were\r\nto lead their brides, and where children of the Pyncheon blood were to be born.\r\nThe terror and ugliness of Maule’s crime, and the wretchedness of his\r\npunishment, would darken the freshly plastered walls, and infect them early\r\nwith the scent of an old and melancholy house. Why, then,—while so much\r\nof the soil around him was bestrewn with the virgin forest leaves,—why\r\nshould Colonel Pyncheon prefer a site that had already been accurst?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the Puritan soldier and magistrate was not a man to be turned aside from\r\nhis well-considered scheme, either by dread of the wizard’s ghost, or by\r\nflimsy sentimentalities of any kind, however specious. Had he been told of a\r\nbad air, it might have moved him somewhat; but he was ready to encounter an\r\nevil spirit on his own ground. Endowed with commonsense, as massive and hard as\r\nblocks of granite, fastened together by stern rigidity of purpose, as with iron\r\nclamps, he followed out his original design, probably without so much as\r\nimagining an objection to it. On the score of delicacy, or any scrupulousness\r\nwhich a finer sensibility might have taught him, the Colonel, like most of his\r\nbreed and generation, was impenetrable. He therefore dug his cellar, and laid\r\nthe deep foundations of his mansion, on the square of earth whence Matthew\r\nMaule, forty years before, had first swept away the fallen leaves. It was a\r\ncurious, and, as some people thought, an ominous fact, that, very soon after\r\nthe workmen began their operations, the spring of water, above mentioned,\r\nentirely lost the deliciousness of its pristine quality. Whether its sources\r\nwere disturbed by the depth of the new cellar, or whatever subtler cause might\r\nlurk at the bottom, it is certain that the water of Maule’s Well, as it\r\ncontinued to be called, grew hard and brackish. Even such we find it now; and\r\nany old woman of the neighborhood will certify that it is productive of\r\nintestinal mischief to those who quench their thirst there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe reader may deem it singular that the head carpenter of the new edifice was\r\nno other than the son of the very man from whose dead gripe the property of the\r\nsoil had been wrested. Not improbably he was the best workman of his time; or,\r\nperhaps, the Colonel thought it expedient, or was impelled by some better\r\nfeeling, thus openly to cast aside all animosity against the race of his fallen\r\nantagonist. Nor was it out of keeping with the general coarseness and\r\nmatter-of-fact character of the age, that the son should be willing to earn an\r\nhonest penny, or, rather, a weighty amount of sterling pounds, from the purse\r\nof his father’s deadly enemy. At all events, Thomas Maule became the\r\narchitect of the House of the Seven Gables, and performed his duty so\r\nfaithfully that the timber framework fastened by his hands still holds\r\ntogether.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus the great house was built. Familiar as it stands in the writer’s\r\nrecollection,—for it has been an object of curiosity with him from\r\nboyhood, both as a specimen of the best and stateliest architecture of a\r\nlongpast epoch, and as the scene of events more full of human interest,\r\nperhaps, than those of a gray feudal castle,—familiar as it stands, in\r\nits rusty old age, it is therefore only the more difficult to imagine the\r\nbright novelty with which it first caught the sunshine. The impression of its\r\nactual state, at this distance of a hundred and sixty years, darkens inevitably\r\nthrough the picture which we would fain give of its appearance on the morning\r\nwhen the Puritan magnate bade all the town to be his guests. A ceremony of\r\nconsecration, festive as well as religious, was now to be performed. A prayer\r\nand discourse from the Rev. Mr. Higginson, and the outpouring of a psalm from\r\nthe general throat of the community, was to be made acceptable to the grosser\r\nsense by ale, cider, wine, and brandy, in copious effusion, and, as some\r\nauthorities aver, by an ox, roasted whole, or at least, by the weight and\r\nsubstance of an ox, in more manageable joints and sirloins. The carcass of a\r\ndeer, shot within twenty miles, had supplied material for the vast\r\ncircumference of a pasty. A codfish of sixty pounds, caught in the bay, had\r\nbeen dissolved into the rich liquid of a chowder. The chimney of the new house,\r\nin short, belching forth its kitchen smoke, impregnated the whole air with the\r\nscent of meats, fowls, and fishes, spicily concocted with odoriferous herbs,\r\nand onions in abundance. The mere smell of such festivity, making its way to\r\neverybody’s nostrils, was at once an invitation and an appetite.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMaule’s Lane, or Pyncheon Street, as it were now more decorous to call\r\nit, was thronged, at the appointed hour, as with a congregation on its way to\r\nchurch. All, as they approached, looked upward at the imposing edifice, which\r\nwas henceforth to assume its rank among the habitations of mankind. There it\r\nrose, a little withdrawn from the line of the street, but in pride, not\r\nmodesty. Its whole visible exterior was ornamented with quaint figures,\r\nconceived in the grotesqueness of a Gothic fancy, and drawn or stamped in the\r\nglittering plaster, composed of lime, pebbles, and bits of glass, with which\r\nthe woodwork of the walls was overspread. On every side the seven gables\r\npointed sharply towards the sky, and presented the aspect of a whole sisterhood\r\nof edifices, breathing through the spiracles of one great chimney. The many\r\nlattices, with their small, diamond-shaped panes, admitted the sunlight into\r\nhall and chamber, while, nevertheless, the second story, projecting far over\r\nthe base, and itself retiring beneath the third, threw a shadowy and thoughtful\r\ngloom into the lower rooms. Carved globes of wood were affixed under the\r\njutting stories. Little spiral rods of iron beautified each of the seven peaks.\r\nOn the triangular portion of the gable, that fronted next the street, was a\r\ndial, put up that very morning, and on which the sun was still marking the\r\npassage of the first bright hour in a history that was not destined to be all\r\nso bright. All around were scattered shavings, chips, shingles, and broken\r\nhalves of bricks; these, together with the lately turned earth, on which the\r\ngrass had not begun to grow, contributed to the impression of strangeness and\r\nnovelty proper to a house that had yet its place to make among men’s\r\ndaily interests.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe principal entrance, which had almost the breadth of a church-door, was in\r\nthe angle between the two front gables, and was covered by an open porch, with\r\nbenches beneath its shelter. Under this arched doorway, scraping their feet on\r\nthe unworn threshold, now trod the clergymen, the elders, the magistrates, the\r\ndeacons, and whatever of aristocracy there was in town or county. Thither, too,\r\nthronged the plebeian classes as freely as their betters, and in larger number.\r\nJust within the entrance, however, stood two serving-men, pointing some of the\r\nguests to the neighborhood of the kitchen and ushering others into the\r\nstatelier rooms,—hospitable alike to all, but still with a scrutinizing\r\nregard to the high or low degree of each. Velvet garments sombre but rich,\r\nstiffly plaited ruffs and bands, embroidered gloves, venerable beards, the mien\r\nand countenance of authority, made it easy to distinguish the gentleman of\r\nworship, at that period, from the tradesman, with his plodding air, or the\r\nlaborer, in his leathern jerkin, stealing awe-stricken into the house which he\r\nhad perhaps helped to build.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne inauspicious circumstance there was, which awakened a hardly concealed\r\ndispleasure in the breasts of a few of the more punctilious visitors. The\r\nfounder of this stately mansion—a gentleman noted for the square and\r\nponderous courtesy of his demeanor, ought surely to have stood in his own hall,\r\nand to have offered the first welcome to so many eminent personages as here\r\npresented themselves in honor of his solemn festival. He was as yet invisible;\r\nthe most favored of the guests had not beheld him. This sluggishness on Colonel\r\nPyncheon’s part became still more unaccountable, when the second\r\ndignitary of the province made his appearance, and found no more ceremonious a\r\nreception. The lieutenant-governor, although his visit was one of the\r\nanticipated glories of the day, had alighted from his horse, and assisted his\r\nlady from her side-saddle, and crossed the Colonel’s threshold, without\r\nother greeting than that of the principal domestic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis person—a gray-headed man, of quiet and most respectful\r\ndeportment—found it necessary to explain that his master still remained\r\nin his study, or private apartment; on entering which, an hour before, he had\r\nexpressed a wish on no account to be disturbed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do not you see, fellow,” said the high-sheriff of the county,\r\ntaking the servant aside, “that this is no less a man than the\r\nlieutenant-governor? Summon Colonel Pyncheon at once! I know that he received\r\nletters from England this morning; and, in the perusal and consideration of\r\nthem, an hour may have passed away without his noticing it. But he will be\r\nill-pleased, I judge, if you suffer him to neglect the courtesy due to one of\r\nour chief rulers, and who may be said to represent King William, in the absence\r\nof the governor himself. Call your master instantly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nay, please your worship,” answered the man, in much perplexity,\r\nbut with a backwardness that strikingly indicated the hard and severe character\r\nof Colonel Pyncheon’s domestic rule; “my master’s orders were\r\nexceeding strict; and, as your worship knows, he permits of no discretion in\r\nthe obedience of those who owe him service. Let who list open yonder door; I\r\ndare not, though the governor’s own voice should bid me do it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pooh, pooh, master high sheriff!” cried the lieutenant-governor,\r\nwho had overheard the foregoing discussion, and felt himself high enough in\r\nstation to play a little with his dignity. “I will take the matter into\r\nmy own hands. It is time that the good Colonel came forth to greet his friends;\r\nelse we shall be apt to suspect that he has taken a sip too much of his Canary\r\nwine, in his extreme deliberation which cask it were best to broach in honor of\r\nthe day! But since he is so much behindhand, I will give him a remembrancer\r\nmyself!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccordingly, with such a tramp of his ponderous riding-boots as might of itself\r\nhave been audible in the remotest of the seven gables, he advanced to the door,\r\nwhich the servant pointed out, and made its new panels reecho with a loud, free\r\nknock. Then, looking round, with a smile, to the spectators, he awaited a\r\nresponse. As none came, however, he knocked again, but with the same\r\nunsatisfactory result as at first. And now, being a trifle choleric in his\r\ntemperament, the lieutenant-governor uplifted the heavy hilt of his sword,\r\nwherewith he so beat and banged upon the door, that, as some of the bystanders\r\nwhispered, the racket might have disturbed the dead. Be that as it might, it\r\nseemed to produce no awakening effect on Colonel Pyncheon. When the sound\r\nsubsided, the silence through the house was deep, dreary, and oppressive,\r\nnotwithstanding that the tongues of many of the guests had already been\r\nloosened by a surreptitious cup or two of wine or spirits.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Strange, forsooth!—very strange!” cried the\r\nlieutenant-governor, whose smile was changed to a frown. “But seeing that\r\nour host sets us the good example of forgetting ceremony, I shall likewise\r\nthrow it aside, and make free to intrude on his privacy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe tried the door, which yielded to his hand, and was flung wide open by a\r\nsudden gust of wind that passed, as with a loud sigh, from the outermost portal\r\nthrough all the passages and apartments of the new house. It rustled the silken\r\ngarments of the ladies, and waved the long curls of the gentlemen’s wigs,\r\nand shook the window-hangings and the curtains of the bedchambers; causing\r\neverywhere a singular stir, which yet was more like a hush. A shadow of awe and\r\nhalf-fearful anticipation—nobody knew wherefore, nor of what—had\r\nall at once fallen over the company.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey thronged, however, to the now open door, pressing the lieutenant-governor,\r\nin the eagerness of their curiosity, into the room in advance of them. At the\r\nfirst glimpse they beheld nothing extraordinary: a handsomely furnished room,\r\nof moderate size, somewhat darkened by curtains; books arranged on shelves; a\r\nlarge map on the wall, and likewise a portrait of Colonel Pyncheon, beneath\r\nwhich sat the original Colonel himself, in an oaken elbow-chair, with a pen in\r\nhis hand. Letters, parchments, and blank sheets of paper were on the table\r\nbefore him. He appeared to gaze at the curious crowd, in front of which stood\r\nthe lieutenant-governor; and there was a frown on his dark and massive\r\ncountenance, as if sternly resentful of the boldness that had impelled them\r\ninto his private retirement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA little boy—the Colonel’s grandchild, and the only human being\r\nthat ever dared to be familiar with him—now made his way among the\r\nguests, and ran towards the seated figure; then pausing halfway, he began to\r\nshriek with terror. The company, tremulous as the leaves of a tree, when all\r\nare shaking together, drew nearer, and perceived that there was an unnatural\r\ndistortion in the fixedness of Colonel Pyncheon’s stare; that there was\r\nblood on his ruff, and that his hoary beard was saturated with it. It was too\r\nlate to give assistance. The iron-hearted Puritan, the relentless persecutor,\r\nthe grasping and strong-willed man was dead! Dead, in his new house! There is a\r\ntradition, only worth alluding to as lending a tinge of superstitious awe to a\r\nscene perhaps gloomy enough without it, that a voice spoke loudly among the\r\nguests, the tones of which were like those of old Matthew Maule, the executed\r\nwizard,—“God hath given him blood to drink!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus early had that one guest,—the only guest who is certain, at one time\r\nor another, to find his way into every human dwelling,—thus early had\r\nDeath stepped across the threshold of the House of the Seven Gables!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nColonel Pyncheon’s sudden and mysterious end made a vast deal of noise in\r\nits day. There were many rumors, some of which have vaguely drifted down to the\r\npresent time, how that appearances indicated violence; that there were the\r\nmarks of fingers on his throat, and the print of a bloody hand on his plaited\r\nruff; and that his peaked beard was dishevelled, as if it had been fiercely\r\nclutched and pulled. It was averred, likewise, that the lattice window, near\r\nthe Colonel’s chair, was open; and that, only a few minutes before the\r\nfatal occurrence, the figure of a man had been seen clambering over the garden\r\nfence, in the rear of the house. But it were folly to lay any stress on stories\r\nof this kind, which are sure to spring up around such an event as that now\r\nrelated, and which, as in the present case, sometimes prolong themselves for\r\nages afterwards, like the toadstools that indicate where the fallen and buried\r\ntrunk of a tree has long since mouldered into the earth. For our own part, we\r\nallow them just as little credence as to that other fable of the skeleton hand\r\nwhich the lieutenant-governor was said to have seen at the Colonel’s\r\nthroat, but which vanished away, as he advanced farther into the room. Certain\r\nit is, however, that there was a great consultation and dispute of doctors over\r\nthe dead body. One,—John Swinnerton by name,—who appears to have\r\nbeen a man of eminence, upheld it, if we have rightly understood his terms of\r\nart, to be a case of apoplexy. His professional brethren, each for himself,\r\nadopted various hypotheses, more or less plausible, but all dressed out in a\r\nperplexing mystery of phrase, which, if it do not show a bewilderment of mind\r\nin these erudite physicians, certainly causes it in the unlearned peruser of\r\ntheir opinions. The coroner’s jury sat upon the corpse, and, like\r\nsensible men, returned an unassailable verdict of “Sudden Death!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is indeed difficult to imagine that there could have been a serious\r\nsuspicion of murder, or the slightest grounds for implicating any particular\r\nindividual as the perpetrator. The rank, wealth, and eminent character of the\r\ndeceased must have insured the strictest scrutiny into every ambiguous\r\ncircumstance. As none such is on record, it is safe to assume that none\r\nexisted. Tradition,—which sometimes brings down truth that history has\r\nlet slip, but is oftener the wild babble of the time, such as was formerly\r\nspoken at the fireside and now congeals in newspapers,—tradition is\r\nresponsible for all contrary averments. In Colonel Pyncheon’s funeral\r\nsermon, which was printed, and is still extant, the Rev. Mr. Higginson\r\nenumerates, among the many felicities of his distinguished parishioner’s\r\nearthly career, the happy seasonableness of his death. His duties all\r\nperformed,—the highest prosperity attained,—his race and future\r\ngenerations fixed on a stable basis, and with a stately roof to shelter them\r\nfor centuries to come,—what other upward step remained for this good man\r\nto take, save the final step from earth to the golden gate of heaven! The pious\r\nclergyman surely would not have uttered words like these had he in the least\r\nsuspected that the Colonel had been thrust into the other world with the clutch\r\nof violence upon his throat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe family of Colonel Pyncheon, at the epoch of his death, seemed destined to\r\nas fortunate a permanence as can anywise consist with the inherent instability\r\nof human affairs. It might fairly be anticipated that the progress of time\r\nwould rather increase and ripen their prosperity, than wear away and destroy\r\nit. For, not only had his son and heir come into immediate enjoyment of a rich\r\nestate, but there was a claim through an Indian deed, confirmed by a subsequent\r\ngrant of the General Court, to a vast and as yet unexplored and unmeasured\r\ntract of Eastern lands. These possessions—for as such they might almost\r\ncertainly be reckoned—comprised the greater part of what is now known as\r\nWaldo County, in the state of Maine, and were more extensive than many a\r\ndukedom, or even a reigning prince’s territory, on European soil. When\r\nthe pathless forest that still covered this wild principality should give\r\nplace—as it inevitably must, though perhaps not till ages hence—to\r\nthe golden fertility of human culture, it would be the source of incalculable\r\nwealth to the Pyncheon blood. Had the Colonel survived only a few weeks longer,\r\nit is probable that his great political influence, and powerful connections at\r\nhome and abroad, would have consummated all that was necessary to render the\r\nclaim available. But, in spite of good Mr. Higginson’s congratulatory\r\neloquence, this appeared to be the one thing which Colonel Pyncheon, provident\r\nand sagacious as he was, had allowed to go at loose ends. So far as the\r\nprospective territory was concerned, he unquestionably died too soon. His son\r\nlacked not merely the father’s eminent position, but the talent and force\r\nof character to achieve it: he could, therefore, effect nothing by dint of\r\npolitical interest; and the bare justice or legality of the claim was not so\r\napparent, after the Colonel’s decease, as it had been pronounced in his\r\nlifetime. Some connecting link had slipped out of the evidence, and could not\r\nanywhere be found.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEfforts, it is true, were made by the Pyncheons, not only then, but at various\r\nperiods for nearly a hundred years afterwards, to obtain what they stubbornly\r\npersisted in deeming their right. But, in course of time, the territory was\r\npartly regranted to more favored individuals, and partly cleared and occupied\r\nby actual settlers. These last, if they ever heard of the Pyncheon title, would\r\nhave laughed at the idea of any man’s asserting a right—on the\r\nstrength of mouldy parchments, signed with the faded autographs of governors\r\nand legislators long dead and forgotten—to the lands which they or their\r\nfathers had wrested from the wild hand of nature by their own sturdy toil. This\r\nimpalpable claim, therefore, resulted in nothing more solid than to cherish,\r\nfrom generation to generation, an absurd delusion of family importance, which\r\nall along characterized the Pyncheons. It caused the poorest member of the race\r\nto feel as if he inherited a kind of nobility, and might yet come into the\r\npossession of princely wealth to support it. In the better specimens of the\r\nbreed, this peculiarity threw an ideal grace over the hard material of human\r\nlife, without stealing away any truly valuable quality. In the baser sort, its\r\neffect was to increase the liability to sluggishness and dependence, and induce\r\nthe victim of a shadowy hope to remit all self-effort, while awaiting the\r\nrealization of his dreams. Years and years after their claim had passed out of\r\nthe public memory, the Pyncheons were accustomed to consult the Colonel’s\r\nancient map, which had been projected while Waldo County was still an unbroken\r\nwilderness. Where the old land surveyor had put down woods, lakes, and rivers,\r\nthey marked out the cleared spaces, and dotted the villages and towns, and\r\ncalculated the progressively increasing value of the territory, as if there\r\nwere yet a prospect of its ultimately forming a princedom for themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn almost every generation, nevertheless, there happened to be some one\r\ndescendant of the family gifted with a portion of the hard, keen sense, and\r\npractical energy, that had so remarkably distinguished the original founder.\r\nHis character, indeed, might be traced all the way down, as distinctly as if\r\nthe Colonel himself, a little diluted, had been gifted with a sort of\r\nintermittent immortality on earth. At two or three epochs, when the fortunes of\r\nthe family were low, this representative of hereditary qualities had made his\r\nappearance, and caused the traditionary gossips of the town to whisper among\r\nthemselves, “Here is the old Pyncheon come again! Now the Seven Gables\r\nwill be new-shingled!” From father to son, they clung to the ancestral\r\nhouse with singular tenacity of home attachment. For various reasons, however,\r\nand from impressions often too vaguely founded to be put on paper, the writer\r\ncherishes the belief that many, if not most, of the successive proprietors of\r\nthis estate were troubled with doubts as to their moral right to hold it. Of\r\ntheir legal tenure there could be no question; but old Matthew Maule, it is to\r\nbe feared, trode downward from his own age to a far later one, planting a heavy\r\nfootstep, all the way, on the conscience of a Pyncheon. If so, we are left to\r\ndispose of the awful query, whether each inheritor of the\r\nproperty—conscious of wrong, and failing to rectify it—did not\r\ncommit anew the great guilt of his ancestor, and incur all its original\r\nresponsibilities. And supposing such to be the case, would it not be a far\r\ntruer mode of expression to say of the Pyncheon family, that they inherited a\r\ngreat misfortune, than the reverse?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe have already hinted that it is not our purpose to trace down the history of\r\nthe Pyncheon family, in its unbroken connection with the House of the Seven\r\nGables; nor to show, as in a magic picture, how the rustiness and infirmity of\r\nage gathered over the venerable house itself. As regards its interior life, a\r\nlarge, dim looking-glass used to hang in one of the rooms, and was fabled to\r\ncontain within its depths all the shapes that had ever been reflected\r\nthere,—the old Colonel himself, and his many descendants, some in the\r\ngarb of antique babyhood, and others in the bloom of feminine beauty or manly\r\nprime, or saddened with the wrinkles of frosty age. Had we the secret of that\r\nmirror, we would gladly sit down before it, and transfer its revelations to our\r\npage. But there was a story, for which it is difficult to conceive any\r\nfoundation, that the posterity of Matthew Maule had some connection with the\r\nmystery of the looking-glass, and that, by what appears to have been a sort of\r\nmesmeric process, they could make its inner region all alive with the departed\r\nPyncheons; not as they had shown themselves to the world, nor in their better\r\nand happier hours, but as doing over again some deed of sin, or in the crisis\r\nof life’s bitterest sorrow. The popular imagination, indeed, long kept\r\nitself busy with the affair of the old Puritan Pyncheon and the wizard Maule;\r\nthe curse which the latter flung from his scaffold was remembered, with the\r\nvery important addition, that it had become a part of the Pyncheon inheritance.\r\nIf one of the family did but gurgle in his throat, a bystander would be likely\r\nenough to whisper, between jest and earnest, “He has Maule’s blood\r\nto drink!” The sudden death of a Pyncheon, about a hundred years ago,\r\nwith circumstances very similar to what have been related of the\r\nColonel’s exit, was held as giving additional probability to the received\r\nopinion on this topic. It was considered, moreover, an ugly and ominous\r\ncircumstance, that Colonel Pyncheon’s picture—in obedience, it was\r\nsaid, to a provision of his will—remained affixed to the wall of the room\r\nin which he died. Those stern, immitigable features seemed to symbolize an evil\r\ninfluence, and so darkly to mingle the shadow of their presence with the\r\nsunshine of the passing hour, that no good thoughts or purposes could ever\r\nspring up and blossom there. To the thoughtful mind there will be no tinge of\r\nsuperstition in what we figuratively express, by affirming that the ghost of a\r\ndead progenitor—perhaps as a portion of his own punishment—is often\r\ndoomed to become the Evil Genius of his family.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Pyncheons, in brief, lived along, for the better part of two centuries,\r\nwith perhaps less of outward vicissitude than has attended most other New\r\nEngland families during the same period of time. Possessing very distinctive\r\ntraits of their own, they nevertheless took the general characteristics of the\r\nlittle community in which they dwelt; a town noted for its frugal, discreet,\r\nwell-ordered, and home-loving inhabitants, as well as for the somewhat confined\r\nscope of its sympathies; but in which, be it said, there are odder individuals,\r\nand, now and then, stranger occurrences, than one meets with almost anywhere\r\nelse. During the Revolution, the Pyncheon of that epoch, adopting the royal\r\nside, became a refugee; but repented, and made his reappearance, just at the\r\npoint of time to preserve the House of the Seven Gables from confiscation. For\r\nthe last seventy years the most noted event in the Pyncheon annals had been\r\nlikewise the heaviest calamity that ever befell the race; no less than the\r\nviolent death—for so it was adjudged—of one member of the family by\r\nthe criminal act of another. Certain circumstances attending this fatal\r\noccurrence had brought the deed irresistibly home to a nephew of the deceased\r\nPyncheon. The young man was tried and convicted of the crime; but either the\r\ncircumstantial nature of the evidence, and possibly some lurking doubts in the\r\nbreast of the executive, or, lastly—an argument of greater weight in a\r\nrepublic than it could have been under a monarchy,—the high\r\nrespectability and political influence of the criminal’s connections, had\r\navailed to mitigate his doom from death to perpetual imprisonment. This sad\r\naffair had chanced about thirty years before the action of our story commences.\r\nLatterly, there were rumors (which few believed, and only one or two felt\r\ngreatly interested in) that this long-buried man was likely, for some reason or\r\nother, to be summoned forth from his living tomb.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is essential to say a few words respecting the victim of this now almost\r\nforgotten murder. He was an old bachelor, and possessed of great wealth, in\r\naddition to the house and real estate which constituted what remained of the\r\nancient Pyncheon property. Being of an eccentric and melancholy turn of mind,\r\nand greatly given to rummaging old records and hearkening to old traditions, he\r\nhad brought himself, it is averred, to the conclusion that Matthew Maule, the\r\nwizard, had been foully wronged out of his homestead, if not out of his life.\r\nSuch being the case, and he, the old bachelor, in possession of the ill-gotten\r\nspoil,—with the black stain of blood sunken deep into it, and still to be\r\nscented by conscientious nostrils,—the question occurred, whether it were\r\nnot imperative upon him, even at this late hour, to make restitution to\r\nMaule’s posterity. To a man living so much in the past, and so little in\r\nthe present, as the secluded and antiquarian old bachelor, a century and a half\r\nseemed not so vast a period as to obviate the propriety of substituting right\r\nfor wrong. It was the belief of those who knew him best, that he would\r\npositively have taken the very singular step of giving up the House of the\r\nSeven Gables to the representative of Matthew Maule, but for the unspeakable\r\ntumult which a suspicion of the old gentleman’s project awakened among\r\nhis Pyncheon relatives. Their exertions had the effect of suspending his\r\npurpose; but it was feared that he would perform, after death, by the operation\r\nof his last will, what he had so hardly been prevented from doing in his proper\r\nlifetime. But there is no one thing which men so rarely do, whatever the\r\nprovocation or inducement, as to bequeath patrimonial property away from their\r\nown blood. They may love other individuals far better than their\r\nrelatives,—they may even cherish dislike, or positive hatred, to the\r\nlatter; but yet, in view of death, the strong prejudice of propinquity revives,\r\nand impels the testator to send down his estate in the line marked out by\r\ncustom so immemorial that it looks like nature. In all the Pyncheons, this\r\nfeeling had the energy of disease. It was too powerful for the conscientious\r\nscruples of the old bachelor; at whose death, accordingly, the mansion-house,\r\ntogether with most of his other riches, passed into the possession of his next\r\nlegal representative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a nephew, the cousin of the miserable young man who had been convicted\r\nof the uncle’s murder. The new heir, up to the period of his accession,\r\nwas reckoned rather a dissipated youth, but had at once reformed, and made\r\nhimself an exceedingly respectable member of society. In fact, he showed more\r\nof the Pyncheon quality, and had won higher eminence in the world, than any of\r\nhis race since the time of the original Puritan. Applying himself in earlier\r\nmanhood to the study of the law, and having a natural tendency towards office,\r\nhe had attained, many years ago, to a judicial situation in some inferior\r\ncourt, which gave him for life the very desirable and imposing title of judge.\r\nLater, he had engaged in politics, and served a part of two terms in Congress,\r\nbesides making a considerable figure in both branches of the State legislature.\r\nJudge Pyncheon was unquestionably an honor to his race. He had built himself a\r\ncountry-seat within a few miles of his native town, and there spent such\r\nportions of his time as could be spared from public service in the display of\r\nevery grace and virtue—as a newspaper phrased it, on the eve of an\r\nelection—befitting the Christian, the good citizen, the horticulturist,\r\nand the gentleman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere were few of the Pyncheons left to sun themselves in the glow of the\r\nJudge’s prosperity. In respect to natural increase, the breed had not\r\nthriven; it appeared rather to be dying out. The only members of the family\r\nknown to be extant were, first, the Judge himself, and a single surviving son,\r\nwho was now travelling in Europe; next, the thirty years’ prisoner,\r\nalready alluded to, and a sister of the latter, who occupied, in an extremely\r\nretired manner, the House of the Seven Gables, in which she had a life-estate\r\nby the will of the old bachelor. She was understood to be wretchedly poor, and\r\nseemed to make it her choice to remain so; inasmuch as her affluent cousin, the\r\nJudge, had repeatedly offered her all the comforts of life, either in the old\r\nmansion or his own modern residence. The last and youngest Pyncheon was a\r\nlittle country-girl of seventeen, the daughter of another of the Judge’s\r\ncousins, who had married a young woman of no family or property, and died early\r\nand in poor circumstances. His widow had recently taken another husband.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs for Matthew Maule’s posterity, it was supposed now to be extinct. For\r\na very long period after the witchcraft delusion, however, the Maules had\r\ncontinued to inhabit the town where their progenitor had suffered so unjust a\r\ndeath. To all appearance, they were a quiet, honest, well-meaning race of\r\npeople, cherishing no malice against individuals or the public for the wrong\r\nwhich had been done them; or if, at their own fireside, they transmitted from\r\nfather to child any hostile recollection of the wizard’s fate and their\r\nlost patrimony, it was never acted upon, nor openly expressed. Nor would it\r\nhave been singular had they ceased to remember that the House of the Seven\r\nGables was resting its heavy framework on a foundation that was rightfully\r\ntheir own. There is something so massive, stable, and almost irresistibly\r\nimposing in the exterior presentment of established rank and great possessions,\r\nthat their very existence seems to give them a right to exist; at least, so\r\nexcellent a counterfeit of right, that few poor and humble men have moral force\r\nenough to question it, even in their secret minds. Such is the case now, after\r\nso many ancient prejudices have been overthrown; and it was far more so in\r\nante-Revolutionary days, when the aristocracy could venture to be proud, and\r\nthe low were content to be abased. Thus the Maules, at all events, kept their\r\nresentments within their own breasts. They were generally poverty-stricken;\r\nalways plebeian and obscure; working with unsuccessful diligence at\r\nhandicrafts; laboring on the wharves, or following the sea, as sailors before\r\nthe mast; living here and there about the town, in hired tenements, and coming\r\nfinally to the almshouse as the natural home of their old age. At last, after\r\ncreeping, as it were, for such a length of time along the utmost verge of the\r\nopaque puddle of obscurity, they had taken that downright plunge which, sooner\r\nor later, is the destiny of all families, whether princely or plebeian. For\r\nthirty years past, neither town-record, nor gravestone, nor the directory, nor\r\nthe knowledge or memory of man, bore any trace of Matthew Maule’s\r\ndescendants. His blood might possibly exist elsewhere; here, where its lowly\r\ncurrent could be traced so far back, it had ceased to keep an onward course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo long as any of the race were to be found, they had been marked out from\r\nother men—not strikingly, nor as with a sharp line, but with an effect\r\nthat was felt rather than spoken of—by an hereditary character of\r\nreserve. Their companions, or those who endeavored to become such, grew\r\nconscious of a circle round about the Maules, within the sanctity or the spell\r\nof which, in spite of an exterior of sufficient frankness and good-fellowship,\r\nit was impossible for any man to step. It was this indefinable peculiarity,\r\nperhaps, that, by insulating them from human aid, kept them always so\r\nunfortunate in life. It certainly operated to prolong in their case, and to\r\nconfirm to them as their only inheritance, those feelings of repugnance and\r\nsuperstitious terror with which the people of the town, even after awakening\r\nfrom their frenzy, continued to regard the memory of the reputed witches. The\r\nmantle, or rather the ragged cloak, of old Matthew Maule had fallen upon his\r\nchildren. They were half believed to inherit mysterious attributes; the family\r\neye was said to possess strange power. Among other good-for-nothing properties\r\nand privileges, one was especially assigned them,—that of exercising an\r\ninfluence over people’s dreams. The Pyncheons, if all stories were true,\r\nhaughtily as they bore themselves in the noonday streets of their native town,\r\nwere no better than bond-servants to these plebeian Maules, on entering the\r\ntopsy-turvy commonwealth of sleep. Modern psychology, it may be, will endeavor\r\nto reduce these alleged necromancies within a system, instead of rejecting them\r\nas altogether fabulous.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA descriptive paragraph or two, treating of the seven-gabled mansion in its\r\nmore recent aspect, will bring this preliminary chapter to a close. The street\r\nin which it upreared its venerable peaks has long ceased to be a fashionable\r\nquarter of the town; so that, though the old edifice was surrounded by\r\nhabitations of modern date, they were mostly small, built entirely of wood, and\r\ntypical of the most plodding uniformity of common life. Doubtless, however, the\r\nwhole story of human existence may be latent in each of them, but with no\r\npicturesqueness, externally, that can attract the imagination or sympathy to\r\nseek it there. But as for the old structure of our story, its white-oak frame,\r\nand its boards, shingles, and crumbling plaster, and even the huge, clustered\r\nchimney in the midst, seemed to constitute only the least and meanest part of\r\nits reality. So much of mankind’s varied experience had passed\r\nthere,—so much had been suffered, and something, too, enjoyed,—that\r\nthe very timbers were oozy, as with the moisture of a heart. It was itself like\r\na great human heart, with a life of its own, and full of rich and sombre\r\nreminiscences.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe deep projection of the second story gave the house such a meditative look,\r\nthat you could not pass it without the idea that it had secrets to keep, and an\r\neventful history to moralize upon. In front, just on the edge of the unpaved\r\nsidewalk, grew the Pyncheon Elm, which, in reference to such trees as one\r\nusually meets with, might well be termed gigantic. It had been planted by a\r\ngreat-grandson of the first Pyncheon, and, though now four-score years of age,\r\nor perhaps nearer a hundred, was still in its strong and broad maturity,\r\nthrowing its shadow from side to side of the street, overtopping the seven\r\ngables, and sweeping the whole black roof with its pendant foliage. It gave\r\nbeauty to the old edifice, and seemed to make it a part of nature. The street\r\nhaving been widened about forty years ago, the front gable was now precisely on\r\na line with it. On either side extended a ruinous wooden fence of open\r\nlattice-work, through which could be seen a grassy yard, and, especially in the\r\nangles of the building, an enormous fertility of burdocks, with leaves, it is\r\nhardly an exaggeration to say, two or three feet long. Behind the house there\r\nappeared to be a garden, which undoubtedly had once been extensive, but was now\r\ninfringed upon by other enclosures, or shut in by habitations and outbuildings\r\nthat stood on another street. It would be an omission, trifling, indeed, but\r\nunpardonable, were we to forget the green moss that had long since gathered\r\nover the projections of the windows, and on the slopes of the roof nor must we\r\nfail to direct the reader’s eye to a crop, not of weeds, but\r\nflower-shrubs, which were growing aloft in the air, not a great way from the\r\nchimney, in the nook between two of the gables. They were called Alice’s\r\nPosies. The tradition was, that a certain Alice Pyncheon had flung up the\r\nseeds, in sport, and that the dust of the street and the decay of the roof\r\ngradually formed a kind of soil for them, out of which they grew, when Alice\r\nhad long been in her grave. However the flowers might have come there, it was\r\nboth sad and sweet to observe how Nature adopted to herself this desolate,\r\ndecaying, gusty, rusty old house of the Pyncheon family; and how the\r\never-returning Summer did her best to gladden it with tender beauty, and grew\r\nmelancholy in the effort.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is one other feature, very essential to be noticed, but which, we greatly\r\nfear, may damage any picturesque and romantic impression which we have been\r\nwilling to throw over our sketch of this respectable edifice. In the front\r\ngable, under the impending brow of the second story, and contiguous to the\r\nstreet, was a shop-door, divided horizontally in the midst, and with a window\r\nfor its upper segment, such as is often seen in dwellings of a somewhat ancient\r\ndate. This same shop-door had been a subject of no slight mortification to the\r\npresent occupant of the august Pyncheon House, as well as to some of her\r\npredecessors. The matter is disagreeably delicate to handle; but, since the\r\nreader must needs be let into the secret, he will please to understand, that,\r\nabout a century ago, the head of the Pyncheons found himself involved in\r\nserious financial difficulties. The fellow (gentleman, as he styled himself)\r\ncan hardly have been other than a spurious interloper; for, instead of seeking\r\noffice from the king or the royal governor, or urging his hereditary claim to\r\nEastern lands, he bethought himself of no better avenue to wealth than by\r\ncutting a shop-door through the side of his ancestral residence. It was the\r\ncustom of the time, indeed, for merchants to store their goods and transact\r\nbusiness in their own dwellings. But there was something pitifully small in\r\nthis old Pyncheon’s mode of setting about his commercial operations; it\r\nwas whispered, that, with his own hands, all beruffled as they were, he used to\r\ngive change for a shilling, and would turn a half-penny twice over, to make\r\nsure that it was a good one. Beyond all question, he had the blood of a petty\r\nhuckster in his veins, through whatever channel it may have found its way\r\nthere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImmediately on his death, the shop-door had been locked, bolted, and barred,\r\nand, down to the period of our story, had probably never once been opened. The\r\nold counter, shelves, and other fixtures of the little shop remained just as he\r\nhad left them. It used to be affirmed, that the dead shop-keeper, in a white\r\nwig, a faded velvet coat, an apron at his waist, and his ruffles carefully\r\nturned back from his wrists, might be seen through the chinks of the shutters,\r\nany night of the year, ransacking his till, or poring over the dingy pages of\r\nhis day-book. From the look of unutterable woe upon his face, it appeared to be\r\nhis doom to spend eternity in a vain effort to make his accounts balance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now—in a very humble way, as will be seen—we proceed to open\r\nour narrative.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>II.<br>\r\nThe Little Shop-Window</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt still lacked half an hour of sunrise, when Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon—we\r\nwill not say awoke, it being doubtful whether the poor lady had so much as\r\nclosed her eyes during the brief night of midsummer—but, at all events,\r\narose from her solitary pillow, and began what it would be mockery to term the\r\nadornment of her person. Far from us be the indecorum of assisting, even in\r\nimagination, at a maiden lady’s toilet! Our story must therefore await\r\nMiss Hepzibah at the threshold of her chamber; only presuming, meanwhile, to\r\nnote some of the heavy sighs that labored from her bosom, with little restraint\r\nas to their lugubrious depth and volume of sound, inasmuch as they could be\r\naudible to nobody save a disembodied listener like ourself. The Old Maid was\r\nalone in the old house. Alone, except for a certain respectable and orderly\r\nyoung man, an artist in the daguerreotype line, who, for about three months\r\nback, had been a lodger in a remote gable,—quite a house by itself,\r\nindeed,—with locks, bolts, and oaken bars on all the intervening doors.\r\nInaudible, consequently, were poor Miss Hepzibah’s gusty sighs. Inaudible\r\nthe creaking joints of her stiffened knees, as she knelt down by the bedside.\r\nAnd inaudible, too, by mortal ear, but heard with all-comprehending love and\r\npity in the farthest heaven, that almost agony of prayer—now whispered,\r\nnow a groan, now a struggling silence—wherewith she besought the Divine\r\nassistance through the day! Evidently, this is to be a day of more than\r\nordinary trial to Miss Hepzibah, who, for above a quarter of a century gone by,\r\nhas dwelt in strict seclusion, taking no part in the business of life, and just\r\nas little in its intercourse and pleasures. Not with such fervor prays the\r\ntorpid recluse, looking forward to the cold, sunless, stagnant calm of a day\r\nthat is to be like innumerable yesterdays.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe maiden lady’s devotions are concluded. Will she now issue forth over\r\nthe threshold of our story? Not yet, by many moments. First, every drawer in\r\nthe tall, old-fashioned bureau is to be opened, with difficulty, and with a\r\nsuccession of spasmodic jerks then, all must close again, with the same fidgety\r\nreluctance. There is a rustling of stiff silks; a tread of backward and forward\r\nfootsteps to and fro across the chamber. We suspect Miss Hepzibah, moreover, of\r\ntaking a step upward into a chair, in order to give heedful regard to her\r\nappearance on all sides, and at full length, in the oval, dingy-framed\r\ntoilet-glass, that hangs above her table. Truly! well, indeed! who would have\r\nthought it! Is all this precious time to be lavished on the matutinal repair\r\nand beautifying of an elderly person, who never goes abroad, whom nobody ever\r\nvisits, and from whom, when she shall have done her utmost, it were the best\r\ncharity to turn one’s eyes another way?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow she is almost ready. Let us pardon her one other pause; for it is given to\r\nthe sole sentiment, or, we might better say,—heightened and rendered\r\nintense, as it has been, by sorrow and seclusion,—to the strong passion\r\nof her life. We heard the turning of a key in a small lock; she has opened a\r\nsecret drawer of an escritoire, and is probably looking at a certain miniature,\r\ndone in Malbone’s most perfect style, and representing a face worthy of\r\nno less delicate a pencil. It was once our good fortune to see this picture. It\r\nis a likeness of a young man, in a silken dressing-gown of an old fashion, the\r\nsoft richness of which is well adapted to the countenance of reverie, with its\r\nfull, tender lips, and beautiful eyes, that seem to indicate not so much\r\ncapacity of thought, as gentle and voluptuous emotion. Of the possessor of such\r\nfeatures we shall have a right to ask nothing, except that he would take the\r\nrude world easily, and make himself happy in it. Can it have been an early\r\nlover of Miss Hepzibah? No; she never had a lover—poor thing, how could\r\nshe?—nor ever knew, by her own experience, what love technically means.\r\nAnd yet, her undying faith and trust, her fresh remembrance, and continual\r\ndevotedness towards the original of that miniature, have been the only\r\nsubstance for her heart to feed upon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe seems to have put aside the miniature, and is standing again before the\r\ntoilet-glass. There are tears to be wiped off. A few more footsteps to and fro;\r\nand here, at last,—with another pitiful sigh, like a gust of chill, damp\r\nwind out of a long-closed vault, the door of which has accidentally been set,\r\najar—here comes Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon! Forth she steps into the dusky,\r\ntime-darkened passage; a tall figure, clad in black silk, with a long and\r\nshrunken waist, feeling her way towards the stairs like a near-sighted person,\r\nas in truth she is.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe sun, meanwhile, if not already above the horizon, was ascending nearer and\r\nnearer to its verge. A few clouds, floating high upward, caught some of the\r\nearliest light, and threw down its golden gleam on the windows of all the\r\nhouses in the street, not forgetting the House of the Seven Gables,\r\nwhich—many such sunrises as it had witnessed—looked cheerfully at\r\nthe present one. The reflected radiance served to show, pretty distinctly, the\r\naspect and arrangement of the room which Hepzibah entered, after descending the\r\nstairs. It was a low-studded room, with a beam across the ceiling, panelled\r\nwith dark wood, and having a large chimney-piece, set round with pictured\r\ntiles, but now closed by an iron fire-board, through which ran the funnel of a\r\nmodern stove. There was a carpet on the floor, originally of rich texture, but\r\nso worn and faded in these latter years that its once brilliant figure had\r\nquite vanished into one indistinguishable hue. In the way of furniture, there\r\nwere two tables: one, constructed with perplexing intricacy and exhibiting as\r\nmany feet as a centipede; the other, most delicately wrought, with four long\r\nand slender legs, so apparently frail that it was almost incredible what a\r\nlength of time the ancient tea-table had stood upon them. Half a dozen chairs\r\nstood about the room, straight and stiff, and so ingeniously contrived for the\r\ndiscomfort of the human person that they were irksome even to sight, and\r\nconveyed the ugliest possible idea of the state of society to which they could\r\nhave been adapted. One exception there was, however, in a very antique\r\nelbow-chair, with a high back, carved elaborately in oak, and a roomy depth\r\nwithin its arms, that made up, by its spacious comprehensiveness, for the lack\r\nof any of those artistic curves which abound in a modern chair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs for ornamental articles of furniture, we recollect but two, if such they may\r\nbe called. One was a map of the Pyncheon territory at the eastward, not\r\nengraved, but the handiwork of some skilful old draughtsman, and grotesquely\r\nilluminated with pictures of Indians and wild beasts, among which was seen a\r\nlion; the natural history of the region being as little known as its geography,\r\nwhich was put down most fantastically awry. The other adornment was the\r\nportrait of old Colonel Pyncheon, at two thirds length, representing the stern\r\nfeatures of a Puritanic-looking personage, in a skull-cap, with a laced band\r\nand a grizzly beard; holding a Bible with one hand, and in the other uplifting\r\nan iron sword-hilt. The latter object, being more successfully depicted by the\r\nartist, stood out in far greater prominence than the sacred volume. Face to\r\nface with this picture, on entering the apartment, Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon came\r\nto a pause; regarding it with a singular scowl, a strange contortion of the\r\nbrow, which, by people who did not know her, would probably have been\r\ninterpreted as an expression of bitter anger and ill-will. But it was no such\r\nthing. She, in fact, felt a reverence for the pictured visage, of which only a\r\nfar-descended and time-stricken virgin could be susceptible; and this\r\nforbidding scowl was the innocent result of her near-sightedness, and an effort\r\nso to concentrate her powers of vision as to substitute a firm outline of the\r\nobject instead of a vague one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe must linger a moment on this unfortunate expression of poor Hepzibah’s\r\nbrow. Her scowl,—as the world, or such part of it as sometimes caught a\r\ntransitory glimpse of her at the window, wickedly persisted in calling\r\nit,—her scowl had done Miss Hepzibah a very ill office, in establishing\r\nher character as an ill-tempered old maid; nor does it appear improbable that,\r\nby often gazing at herself in a dim looking-glass, and perpetually encountering\r\nher own frown with its ghostly sphere, she had been led to interpret the\r\nexpression almost as unjustly as the world did. “How miserably cross I\r\nlook!” she must often have whispered to herself; and ultimately have\r\nfancied herself so, by a sense of inevitable doom. But her heart never frowned.\r\nIt was naturally tender, sensitive, and full of little tremors and\r\npalpitations; all of which weaknesses it retained, while her visage was growing\r\nso perversely stern, and even fierce. Nor had Hepzibah ever any hardihood,\r\nexcept what came from the very warmest nook in her affections.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll this time, however, we are loitering faintheartedly on the threshold of our\r\nstory. In very truth, we have an invincible reluctance to disclose what Miss\r\nHepzibah Pyncheon was about to do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt has already been observed, that, in the basement story of the gable fronting\r\non the street, an unworthy ancestor, nearly a century ago, had fitted up a\r\nshop. Ever since the old gentleman retired from trade, and fell asleep under\r\nhis coffin-lid, not only the shop-door, but the inner arrangements, had been\r\nsuffered to remain unchanged; while the dust of ages gathered inch-deep over\r\nthe shelves and counter, and partly filled an old pair of scales, as if it were\r\nof value enough to be weighed. It treasured itself up, too, in the half-open\r\ntill, where there still lingered a base sixpence, worth neither more nor less\r\nthan the hereditary pride which had here been put to shame. Such had been the\r\nstate and condition of the little shop in old Hepzibah’s childhood, when\r\nshe and her brother used to play at hide-and-seek in its forsaken precincts. So\r\nit had remained, until within a few days past.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut now, though the shop-window was still closely curtained from the public\r\ngaze, a remarkable change had taken place in its interior. The rich and heavy\r\nfestoons of cobweb, which it had cost a long ancestral succession of spiders\r\ntheir life’s labor to spin and weave, had been carefully brushed away\r\nfrom the ceiling. The counter, shelves, and floor had all been scoured, and the\r\nlatter was overstrewn with fresh blue sand. The brown scales, too, had\r\nevidently undergone rigid discipline, in an unavailing effort to rub off the\r\nrust, which, alas! had eaten through and through their substance. Neither was\r\nthe little old shop any longer empty of merchantable goods. A curious eye,\r\nprivileged to take an account of stock and investigate behind the counter,\r\nwould have discovered a barrel, yea, two or three barrels and half\r\nditto,—one containing flour, another apples, and a third, perhaps, Indian\r\nmeal. There was likewise a square box of pine-wood, full of soap in bars; also,\r\nanother of the same size, in which were tallow candles, ten to the pound. A\r\nsmall stock of brown sugar, some white beans and split peas, and a few other\r\ncommodities of low price, and such as are constantly in demand, made up the\r\nbulkier portion of the merchandise. It might have been taken for a ghostly or\r\nphantasmagoric reflection of the old shop-keeper Pyncheon’s shabbily\r\nprovided shelves, save that some of the articles were of a description and\r\noutward form which could hardly have been known in his day. For instance, there\r\nwas a glass pickle-jar, filled with fragments of Gibraltar rock; not, indeed,\r\nsplinters of the veritable stone foundation of the famous fortress, but bits of\r\ndelectable candy, neatly done up in white paper. Jim Crow, moreover, was seen\r\nexecuting his world-renowned dance, in gingerbread. A party of leaden dragoons\r\nwere galloping along one of the shelves, in equipments and uniform of modern\r\ncut; and there were some sugar figures, with no strong resemblance to the\r\nhumanity of any epoch, but less unsatisfactorily representing our own fashions\r\nthan those of a hundred years ago. Another phenomenon, still more strikingly\r\nmodern, was a package of lucifer matches, which, in old times, would have been\r\nthought actually to borrow their instantaneous flame from the nether fires of\r\nTophet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn short, to bring the matter at once to a point, it was incontrovertibly\r\nevident that somebody had taken the shop and fixtures of the long-retired and\r\nforgotten Mr. Pyncheon, and was about to renew the enterprise of that departed\r\nworthy, with a different set of customers. Who could this bold adventurer be?\r\nAnd, of all places in the world, why had he chosen the House of the Seven\r\nGables as the scene of his commercial speculations?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe return to the elderly maiden. She at length withdrew her eyes from the dark\r\ncountenance of the Colonel’s portrait, heaved a sigh,—indeed, her\r\nbreast was a very cave of Aolus that morning,—and stept across the room\r\non tiptoe, as is the customary gait of elderly women. Passing through an\r\nintervening passage, she opened a door that communicated with the shop, just\r\nnow so elaborately described. Owing to the projection of the upper\r\nstory—and still more to the thick shadow of the Pyncheon Elm, which stood\r\nalmost directly in front of the gable—the twilight, here, was still as\r\nmuch akin to night as morning. Another heavy sigh from Miss Hepzibah! After a\r\nmoment’s pause on the threshold, peering towards the window with her\r\nnear-sighted scowl, as if frowning down some bitter enemy, she suddenly\r\nprojected herself into the shop. The haste, and, as it were, the galvanic\r\nimpulse of the movement, were really quite startling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNervously—in a sort of frenzy, we might almost say—she began to\r\nbusy herself in arranging some children’s playthings, and other little\r\nwares, on the shelves and at the shop-window. In the aspect of this\r\ndark-arrayed, pale-faced, ladylike old figure there was a deeply tragic\r\ncharacter that contrasted irreconcilably with the ludicrous pettiness of her\r\nemployment. It seemed a queer anomaly, that so gaunt and dismal a personage\r\nshould take a toy in hand; a miracle, that the toy did not vanish in her grasp;\r\na miserably absurd idea, that she should go on perplexing her stiff and sombre\r\nintellect with the question how to tempt little boys into her premises! Yet\r\nsuch is undoubtedly her object. Now she places a gingerbread elephant against\r\nthe window, but with so tremulous a touch that it tumbles upon the floor, with\r\nthe dismemberment of three legs and its trunk; it has ceased to be an elephant,\r\nand has become a few bits of musty gingerbread. There, again, she has upset a\r\ntumbler of marbles, all of which roll different ways, and each individual\r\nmarble, devil-directed, into the most difficult obscurity that it can find.\r\nHeaven help our poor old Hepzibah, and forgive us for taking a ludicrous view\r\nof her position! As her rigid and rusty frame goes down upon its hands and\r\nknees, in quest of the absconding marbles, we positively feel so much the more\r\ninclined to shed tears of sympathy, from the very fact that we must needs turn\r\naside and laugh at her. For here,—and if we fail to impress it suitably\r\nupon the reader, it is our own fault, not that of the theme, here is one of the\r\ntruest points of melancholy interest that occur in ordinary life. It was the\r\nfinal throe of what called itself old gentility. A lady—who had fed\r\nherself from childhood with the shadowy food of aristocratic reminiscences, and\r\nwhose religion it was that a lady’s hand soils itself irremediably by\r\ndoing aught for bread,—this born lady, after sixty years of narrowing\r\nmeans, is fain to step down from her pedestal of imaginary rank. Poverty,\r\ntreading closely at her heels for a lifetime, has come up with her at last. She\r\nmust earn her own food, or starve! And we have stolen upon Miss Hepzibah\r\nPyncheon, too irreverently, at the instant of time when the patrician lady is\r\nto be transformed into the plebeian woman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this republican country, amid the fluctuating waves of our social life,\r\nsomebody is always at the drowning-point. The tragedy is enacted with as\r\ncontinual a repetition as that of a popular drama on a holiday, and,\r\nnevertheless, is felt as deeply, perhaps, as when an hereditary noble sinks\r\nbelow his order. More deeply; since, with us, rank is the grosser substance of\r\nwealth and a splendid establishment, and has no spiritual existence after the\r\ndeath of these, but dies hopelessly along with them. And, therefore, since we\r\nhave been unfortunate enough to introduce our heroine at so inauspicious a\r\njuncture, we would entreat for a mood of due solemnity in the spectators of her\r\nfate. Let us behold, in poor Hepzibah, the immemorial, lady—two hundred\r\nyears old, on this side of the water, and thrice as many on the\r\nother,—with her antique portraits, pedigrees, coats of arms, records and\r\ntraditions, and her claim, as joint heiress, to that princely territory at the\r\neastward, no longer a wilderness, but a populous fertility,—born, too, in\r\nPyncheon Street, under the Pyncheon Elm, and in the Pyncheon House, where she\r\nhas spent all her days,—reduced. Now, in that very house, to be the\r\nhucksteress of a cent-shop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis business of setting up a petty shop is almost the only resource of women,\r\nin circumstances at all similar to those of our unfortunate recluse. With her\r\nnear-sightedness, and those tremulous fingers of hers, at once inflexible and\r\ndelicate, she could not be a seamstress; although her sampler, of fifty years\r\ngone by, exhibited some of the most recondite specimens of ornamental\r\nneedlework. A school for little children had been often in her thoughts; and,\r\nat one time, she had begun a review of her early studies in the New England\r\nPrimer, with a view to prepare herself for the office of instructress. But the\r\nlove of children had never been quickened in Hepzibah’s heart, and was\r\nnow torpid, if not extinct; she watched the little people of the neighborhood\r\nfrom her chamber-window, and doubted whether she could tolerate a more intimate\r\nacquaintance with them. Besides, in our day, the very ABC has become a science\r\ngreatly too abstruse to be any longer taught by pointing a pin from letter to\r\nletter. A modern child could teach old Hepzibah more than old Hepzibah could\r\nteach the child. So—with many a cold, deep heart-quake at the idea of at\r\nlast coming into sordid contact with the world, from which she had so long kept\r\naloof, while every added day of seclusion had rolled another stone against the\r\ncavern door of her hermitage—the poor thing bethought herself of the\r\nancient shop-window, the rusty scales, and dusty till. She might have held back\r\na little longer; but another circumstance, not yet hinted at, had somewhat\r\nhastened her decision. Her humble preparations, therefore, were duly made, and\r\nthe enterprise was now to be commenced. Nor was she entitled to complain of any\r\nremarkable singularity in her fate; for, in the town of her nativity, we might\r\npoint to several little shops of a similar description, some of them in houses\r\nas ancient as that of the Seven Gables; and one or two, it may be, where a\r\ndecayed gentlewoman stands behind the counter, as grim an image of family pride\r\nas Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon herself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was overpoweringly ridiculous,—we must honestly confess it,—the\r\ndeportment of the maiden lady while setting her shop in order for the public\r\neye. She stole on tiptoe to the window, as cautiously as if she conceived some\r\nbloody-minded villain to be watching behind the elm-tree, with intent to take\r\nher life. Stretching out her long, lank arm, she put a paper of pearl-buttons,\r\na jew’s-harp, or whatever the small article might be, in its destined\r\nplace, and straightway vanished back into the dusk, as if the world need never\r\nhope for another glimpse of her. It might have been fancied, indeed, that she\r\nexpected to minister to the wants of the community unseen, like a disembodied\r\ndivinity or enchantress, holding forth her bargains to the reverential and\r\nawe-stricken purchaser in an invisible hand. But Hepzibah had no such\r\nflattering dream. She was well aware that she must ultimately come forward, and\r\nstand revealed in her proper individuality; but, like other sensitive persons,\r\nshe could not bear to be observed in the gradual process, and chose rather to\r\nflash forth on the world’s astonished gaze at once.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe inevitable moment was not much longer to be delayed. The sunshine might now\r\nbe seen stealing down the front of the opposite house, from the windows of\r\nwhich came a reflected gleam, struggling through the boughs of the elm-tree,\r\nand enlightening the interior of the shop more distinctly than heretofore. The\r\ntown appeared to be waking up. A baker’s cart had already rattled through\r\nthe street, chasing away the latest vestige of night’s sanctity with the\r\njingle-jangle of its dissonant bells. A milkman was distributing the contents\r\nof his cans from door to door; and the harsh peal of a fisherman’s conch\r\nshell was heard far off, around the corner. None of these tokens escaped\r\nHepzibah’s notice. The moment had arrived. To delay longer would be only\r\nto lengthen out her misery. Nothing remained, except to take down the bar from\r\nthe shop-door, leaving the entrance free—more than free—welcome, as\r\nif all were household friends—to every passer-by, whose eyes might be\r\nattracted by the commodities at the window. This last act Hepzibah now\r\nperformed, letting the bar fall with what smote upon her excited nerves as a\r\nmost astounding clatter. Then—as if the only barrier betwixt herself and\r\nthe world had been thrown down, and a flood of evil consequences would come\r\ntumbling through the gap—she fled into the inner parlor, threw herself\r\ninto the ancestral elbow-chair, and wept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur miserable old Hepzibah! It is a heavy annoyance to a writer, who endeavors\r\nto represent nature, its various attitudes and circumstances, in a reasonably\r\ncorrect outline and true coloring, that so much of the mean and ludicrous\r\nshould be hopelessly mixed up with the purest pathos which life anywhere\r\nsupplies to him. What tragic dignity, for example, can be wrought into a scene\r\nlike this! How can we elevate our history of retribution for the sin of long\r\nago, when, as one of our most prominent figures, we are compelled to\r\nintroduce—not a young and lovely woman, nor even the stately remains of\r\nbeauty, storm-shattered by affliction—but a gaunt, sallow, rusty-jointed\r\nmaiden, in a long-waisted silk gown, and with the strange horror of a turban on\r\nher head! Her visage is not even ugly. It is redeemed from insignificance only\r\nby the contraction of her eyebrows into a near-sighted scowl. And, finally, her\r\ngreat life-trial seems to be, that, after sixty years of idleness, she finds it\r\nconvenient to earn comfortable bread by setting up a shop in a small way.\r\nNevertheless, if we look through all the heroic fortunes of mankind, we shall\r\nfind this same entanglement of something mean and trivial with whatever is\r\nnoblest in joy or sorrow. Life is made up of marble and mud. And, without all\r\nthe deeper trust in a comprehensive sympathy above us, we might hence be led to\r\nsuspect the insult of a sneer, as well as an immitigable frown, on the iron\r\ncountenance of fate. What is called poetic insight is the gift of discerning,\r\nin this sphere of strangely mingled elements, the beauty and the majesty which\r\nare compelled to assume a garb so sordid.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap03\"></a>III.<br>\r\nThe First Customer</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nMiss Hepzibah Pyncheon sat in the oaken elbow-chair, with her hands over her\r\nface, giving way to that heavy down-sinking of the heart which most persons\r\nhave experienced, when the image of hope itself seems ponderously moulded of\r\nlead, on the eve of an enterprise at once doubtful and momentous. She was\r\nsuddenly startled by the tinkling alarum—high, sharp, and\r\nirregular—of a little bell. The maiden lady arose upon her feet, as pale\r\nas a ghost at cock-crow; for she was an enslaved spirit, and this the talisman\r\nto which she owed obedience. This little bell,—to speak in plainer\r\nterms,—being fastened over the shop-door, was so contrived as to vibrate\r\nby means of a steel spring, and thus convey notice to the inner regions of the\r\nhouse when any customer should cross the threshold. Its ugly and spiteful\r\nlittle din (heard now for the first time, perhaps, since Hepzibah’s\r\nperiwigged predecessor had retired from trade) at once set every nerve of her\r\nbody in responsive and tumultuous vibration. The crisis was upon her! Her first\r\ncustomer was at the door!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWithout giving herself time for a second thought, she rushed into the shop,\r\npale, wild, desperate in gesture and expression, scowling portentously, and\r\nlooking far better qualified to do fierce battle with a housebreaker than to\r\nstand smiling behind the counter, bartering small wares for a copper\r\nrecompense. Any ordinary customer, indeed, would have turned his back and fled.\r\nAnd yet there was nothing fierce in Hepzibah’s poor old heart; nor had\r\nshe, at the moment, a single bitter thought against the world at large, or one\r\nindividual man or woman. She wished them all well, but wished, too, that she\r\nherself were done with them, and in her quiet grave.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe applicant, by this time, stood within the doorway. Coming freshly, as he\r\ndid, out of the morning light, he appeared to have brought some of its cheery\r\ninfluences into the shop along with him. It was a slender young man, not more\r\nthan one or two and twenty years old, with rather a grave and thoughtful\r\nexpression for his years, but likewise a springy alacrity and vigor. These\r\nqualities were not only perceptible, physically, in his make and motions, but\r\nmade themselves felt almost immediately in his character. A brown beard, not\r\ntoo silken in its texture, fringed his chin, but as yet without completely\r\nhiding it; he wore a short mustache, too, and his dark, high-featured\r\ncountenance looked all the better for these natural ornaments. As for his\r\ndress, it was of the simplest kind; a summer sack of cheap and ordinary\r\nmaterial, thin checkered pantaloons, and a straw hat, by no means of the finest\r\nbraid. Oak Hall might have supplied his entire equipment. He was chiefly marked\r\nas a gentleman—if such, indeed, he made any claim to be—by the\r\nrather remarkable whiteness and nicety of his clean linen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe met the scowl of old Hepzibah without apparent alarm, as having heretofore\r\nencountered it and found it harmless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“So, my dear Miss Pyncheon,” said the daguerreotypist,—for it\r\nwas that sole other occupant of the seven-gabled mansion,—“I am\r\nglad to see that you have not shrunk from your good purpose. I merely look in\r\nto offer my best wishes, and to ask if I can assist you any further in your\r\npreparations.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPeople in difficulty and distress, or in any manner at odds with the world, can\r\nendure a vast amount of harsh treatment, and perhaps be only the stronger for\r\nit; whereas they give way at once before the simplest expression of what they\r\nperceive to be genuine sympathy. So it proved with poor Hepzibah; for, when she\r\nsaw the young man’s smile,—looking so much the brighter on a\r\nthoughtful face,—and heard his kindly tone, she broke first into a\r\nhysteric giggle and then began to sob.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Mr. Holgrave,” cried she, as soon as she could speak, “I\r\nnever can go through with it! Never, never, never! I wish I were dead, and in\r\nthe old family tomb, with all my forefathers! With my father, and my mother,\r\nand my sister! Yes, and with my brother, who had far better find me there than\r\nhere! The world is too chill and hard,—and I am too old, and too feeble,\r\nand too hopeless!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, believe me, Miss Hepzibah,” said the young man quietly,\r\n“these feelings will not trouble you any longer, after you are once\r\nfairly in the midst of your enterprise. They are unavoidable at this moment,\r\nstanding, as you do, on the outer verge of your long seclusion, and peopling\r\nthe world with ugly shapes, which you will soon find to be as unreal as the\r\ngiants and ogres of a child’s story-book. I find nothing so singular in\r\nlife, as that everything appears to lose its substance the instant one actually\r\ngrapples with it. So it will be with what you think so terrible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I am a woman!” said Hepzibah piteously. “I was going to\r\nsay, a lady,—but I consider that as past.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well; no matter if it be past!” answered the artist, a strange\r\ngleam of half-hidden sarcasm flashing through the kindliness of his manner.\r\n“Let it go! You are the better without it. I speak frankly, my dear Miss\r\nPyncheon!—for are we not friends? I look upon this as one of the\r\nfortunate days of your life. It ends an epoch and begins one. Hitherto, the\r\nlife-blood has been gradually chilling in your veins as you sat aloof, within\r\nyour circle of gentility, while the rest of the world was fighting out its\r\nbattle with one kind of necessity or another. Henceforth, you will at least\r\nhave the sense of healthy and natural effort for a purpose, and of lending your\r\nstrength be it great or small—to the united struggle of mankind. This is\r\nsuccess,—all the success that anybody meets with!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is natural enough, Mr. Holgrave, that you should have ideas like\r\nthese,” rejoined Hepzibah, drawing up her gaunt figure with slightly\r\noffended dignity. “You are a man, a young man, and brought up, I suppose,\r\nas almost everybody is nowadays, with a view to seeking your fortune. But I was\r\nborn a lady, and have always lived one; no matter in what narrowness of means,\r\nalways a lady.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I was not born a gentleman; neither have I lived like one,”\r\nsaid Holgrave, slightly smiling; “so, my dear madam, you will hardly\r\nexpect me to sympathize with sensibilities of this kind; though, unless I\r\ndeceive myself, I have some imperfect comprehension of them. These names of\r\ngentleman and lady had a meaning, in the past history of the world, and\r\nconferred privileges, desirable or otherwise, on those entitled to bear them.\r\nIn the present—and still more in the future condition of society-they\r\nimply, not privilege, but restriction!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These are new notions,” said the old gentlewoman, shaking her\r\nhead. “I shall never understand them; neither do I wish it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We will cease to speak of them, then,” replied the artist, with a\r\nfriendlier smile than his last one, “and I will leave you to feel whether\r\nit is not better to be a true woman than a lady. Do you really think, Miss\r\nHepzibah, that any lady of your family has ever done a more heroic thing, since\r\nthis house was built, than you are performing in it to-day? Never; and if the\r\nPyncheons had always acted so nobly, I doubt whether an old wizard\r\nMaule’s anathema, of which you told me once, would have had much weight\r\nwith Providence against them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah!—no, no!” said Hepzibah, not displeased at this allusion\r\nto the sombre dignity of an inherited curse. “If old Maule’s ghost,\r\nor a descendant of his, could see me behind the counter to-day, he would call\r\nit the fulfillment of his worst wishes. But I thank you for your kindness, Mr.\r\nHolgrave, and will do my utmost to be a good shop-keeper.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pray do” said Holgrave, “and let me have the pleasure of\r\nbeing your first customer. I am about taking a walk to the seashore, before\r\ngoing to my rooms, where I misuse Heaven’s blessed sunshine by tracing\r\nout human features through its agency. A few of those biscuits, dipt in\r\nsea-water, will be just what I need for breakfast. What is the price of half a\r\ndozen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let me be a lady a moment longer,” replied Hepzibah, with a manner\r\nof antique stateliness to which a melancholy smile lent a kind of grace. She\r\nput the biscuits into his hand, but rejected the compensation. “A\r\nPyncheon must not, at all events under her forefathers’ roof, receive\r\nmoney for a morsel of bread from her only friend!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHolgrave took his departure, leaving her, for the moment, with spirits not\r\nquite so much depressed. Soon, however, they had subsided nearly to their\r\nformer dead level. With a beating heart, she listened to the footsteps of early\r\npassengers, which now began to be frequent along the street. Once or twice they\r\nseemed to linger; these strangers, or neighbors, as the case might be, were\r\nlooking at the display of toys and petty commodities in Hepzibah’s\r\nshop-window. She was doubly tortured; in part, with a sense of overwhelming\r\nshame that strange and unloving eyes should have the privilege of gazing, and\r\npartly because the idea occurred to her, with ridiculous importunity, that the\r\nwindow was not arranged so skilfully, nor nearly to so much advantage, as it\r\nmight have been. It seemed as if the whole fortune or failure of her shop might\r\ndepend on the display of a different set of articles, or substituting a fairer\r\napple for one which appeared to be specked. So she made the change, and\r\nstraightway fancied that everything was spoiled by it; not recognizing that it\r\nwas the nervousness of the juncture, and her own native squeamishness as an old\r\nmaid, that wrought all the seeming mischief.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnon, there was an encounter, just at the door-step, betwixt two laboring men,\r\nas their rough voices denoted them to be. After some slight talk about their\r\nown affairs, one of them chanced to notice the shop-window, and directed the\r\nother’s attention to it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“See here!” cried he; “what do you think of this? Trade seems\r\nto be looking up in Pyncheon Street!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, well, this is a sight, to be sure!” exclaimed the other.\r\n“In the old Pyncheon House, and underneath the Pyncheon Elm! Who would\r\nhave thought it? Old Maid Pyncheon is setting up a cent-shop!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Will she make it go, think you, Dixey?” said his friend. “I\r\ndon’t call it a very good stand. There’s another shop just round\r\nthe corner.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Make it go!” cried Dixey, with a most contemptuous expression, as\r\nif the very idea were impossible to be conceived. “Not a bit of it! Why,\r\nher face—I’ve seen it, for I dug her garden for her one\r\nyear—her face is enough to frighten the Old Nick himself, if he had ever\r\nso great a mind to trade with her. People can’t stand it, I tell you! She\r\nscowls dreadfully, reason or none, out of pure ugliness of temper.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, that’s not so much matter,” remarked the other man.\r\n“These sour-tempered folks are mostly handy at business, and know pretty\r\nwell what they are about. But, as you say, I don’t think she’ll do\r\nmuch. This business of keeping cent-shops is overdone, like all other kinds of\r\ntrade, handicraft, and bodily labor. I know it, to my cost! My wife kept a\r\ncent-shop three months, and lost five dollars on her outlay.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Poor business!” responded Dixey, in a tone as if he were shaking\r\nhis head,—“poor business.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor some reason or other, not very easy to analyze, there had hardly been so\r\nbitter a pang in all her previous misery about the matter as what thrilled\r\nHepzibah’s heart on overhearing the above conversation. The testimony in\r\nregard to her scowl was frightfully important; it seemed to hold up her image\r\nwholly relieved from the false light of her self-partialities, and so hideous\r\nthat she dared not look at it. She was absurdly hurt, moreover, by the slight\r\nand idle effect that her setting up shop—an event of such breathless\r\ninterest to herself—appeared to have upon the public, of which these two\r\nmen were the nearest representatives. A glance; a passing word or two; a coarse\r\nlaugh; and she was doubtless forgotten before they turned the corner. They\r\ncared nothing for her dignity, and just as little for her degradation. Then,\r\nalso, the augury of ill-success, uttered from the sure wisdom of experience,\r\nfell upon her half-dead hope like a clod into a grave. The man’s wife had\r\nalready tried the same experiment, and failed! How could the born\r\nlady—the recluse of half a lifetime, utterly unpractised in the world, at\r\nsixty years of age,—how could she ever dream of succeeding, when the\r\nhard, vulgar, keen, busy, hackneyed New England woman had lost five dollars on\r\nher little outlay! Success presented itself as an impossibility, and the hope\r\nof it as a wild hallucination.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome malevolent spirit, doing his utmost to drive Hepzibah mad, unrolled before\r\nher imagination a kind of panorama, representing the great thoroughfare of a\r\ncity all astir with customers. So many and so magnificent shops as there were!\r\nGroceries, toy-shops, drygoods stores, with their immense panes of plate-glass,\r\ntheir gorgeous fixtures, their vast and complete assortments of merchandise, in\r\nwhich fortunes had been invested; and those noble mirrors at the farther end of\r\neach establishment, doubling all this wealth by a brightly burnished vista of\r\nunrealities! On one side of the street this splendid bazaar, with a multitude\r\nof perfumed and glossy salesmen, smirking, smiling, bowing, and measuring out\r\nthe goods. On the other, the dusky old House of the Seven Gables, with the\r\nantiquated shop-window under its projecting story, and Hepzibah herself, in a\r\ngown of rusty black silk, behind the counter, scowling at the world as it went\r\nby! This mighty contrast thrust itself forward as a fair expression of the odds\r\nagainst which she was to begin her struggle for a subsistence. Success?\r\nPreposterous! She would never think of it again! The house might just as well\r\nbe buried in an eternal fog while all other houses had the sunshine on them;\r\nfor not a foot would ever cross the threshold, nor a hand so much as try the\r\ndoor!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, at this instant, the shop-bell, right over her head, tinkled as if it were\r\nbewitched. The old gentlewoman’s heart seemed to be attached to the same\r\nsteel spring, for it went through a series of sharp jerks, in unison with the\r\nsound. The door was thrust open, although no human form was perceptible on the\r\nother side of the half-window. Hepzibah, nevertheless, stood at a gaze, with\r\nher hands clasped, looking very much as if she had summoned up an evil spirit,\r\nand were afraid, yet resolved, to hazard the encounter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Heaven help me!” she groaned mentally. “Now is my hour of\r\nneed!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe door, which moved with difficulty on its creaking and rusty hinges, being\r\nforced quite open, a square and sturdy little urchin became apparent, with\r\ncheeks as red as an apple. He was clad rather shabbily (but, as it seemed, more\r\nowing to his mother’s carelessness than his father’s poverty), in a\r\nblue apron, very wide and short trousers, shoes somewhat out at the toes, and a\r\nchip hat, with the frizzles of his curly hair sticking through its crevices. A\r\nbook and a small slate, under his arm, indicated that he was on his way to\r\nschool. He stared at Hepzibah a moment, as an elder customer than himself would\r\nhave been likely enough to do, not knowing what to make of the tragic attitude\r\nand queer scowl wherewith she regarded him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, child,” said she, taking heart at sight of a personage so\r\nlittle formidable,—“well, my child, what did you wish for?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That Jim Crow there in the window,” answered the urchin, holding\r\nout a cent, and pointing to the gingerbread figure that had attracted his\r\nnotice, as he loitered along to school; “the one that has not a broken\r\nfoot.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo Hepzibah put forth her lank arm, and, taking the effigy from the\r\nshop-window, delivered it to her first customer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No matter for the money,” said she, giving him a little push\r\ntowards the door; for her old gentility was contumaciously squeamish at sight\r\nof the copper coin, and, besides, it seemed such pitiful meanness to take the\r\nchild’s pocket-money in exchange for a bit of stale gingerbread.\r\n“No matter for the cent. You are welcome to Jim Crow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe child, staring with round eyes at this instance of liberality, wholly\r\nunprecedented in his large experience of cent-shops, took the man of\r\ngingerbread, and quitted the premises. No sooner had he reached the sidewalk\r\n(little cannibal that he was!) than Jim Crow’s head was in his mouth. As\r\nhe had not been careful to shut the door, Hepzibah was at the pains of closing\r\nit after him, with a pettish ejaculation or two about the troublesomeness of\r\nyoung people, and particularly of small boys. She had just placed another\r\nrepresentative of the renowned Jim Crow at the window, when again the shop-bell\r\ntinkled clamorously, and again the door being thrust open, with its\r\ncharacteristic jerk and jar, disclosed the same sturdy little urchin who,\r\nprecisely two minutes ago, had made his exit. The crumbs and discoloration of\r\nthe cannibal feast, as yet hardly consummated, were exceedingly visible about\r\nhis mouth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is it now, child?” asked the maiden lady rather impatiently;\r\n“did you come back to shut the door?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” answered the urchin, pointing to the figure that had just\r\nbeen put up; “I want that other Jim Crow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, here it is for you,” said Hepzibah, reaching it down; but\r\nrecognizing that this pertinacious customer would not quit her on any other\r\nterms, so long as she had a gingerbread figure in her shop, she partly drew\r\nback her extended hand, “Where is the cent?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe little boy had the cent ready, but, like a true-born Yankee, would have\r\npreferred the better bargain to the worse. Looking somewhat chagrined, he put\r\nthe coin into Hepzibah’s hand, and departed, sending the second Jim Crow\r\nin quest of the former one. The new shop-keeper dropped the first solid result\r\nof her commercial enterprise into the till. It was done! The sordid stain of\r\nthat copper coin could never be washed away from her palm. The little\r\nschoolboy, aided by the impish figure of the negro dancer, had wrought an\r\nirreparable ruin. The structure of ancient aristocracy had been demolished by\r\nhim, even as if his childish gripe had torn down the seven-gabled mansion. Now\r\nlet Hepzibah turn the old Pyncheon portraits with their faces to the wall, and\r\ntake the map of her Eastern territory to kindle the kitchen fire, and blow up\r\nthe flame with the empty breath of her ancestral traditions! What had she to do\r\nwith ancestry? Nothing; no more than with posterity! No lady, now, but simply\r\nHepzibah Pyncheon, a forlorn old maid, and keeper of a cent-shop!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, even while she paraded these ideas somewhat ostentatiously\r\nthrough her mind, it is altogether surprising what a calmness had come over\r\nher. The anxiety and misgivings which had tormented her, whether asleep or in\r\nmelancholy day-dreams, ever since her project began to take an aspect of\r\nsolidity, had now vanished quite away. She felt the novelty of her position,\r\nindeed, but no longer with disturbance or affright. Now and then, there came a\r\nthrill of almost youthful enjoyment. It was the invigorating breath of a fresh\r\noutward atmosphere, after the long torpor and monotonous seclusion of her life.\r\nSo wholesome is effort! So miraculous the strength that we do not know of! The\r\nhealthiest glow that Hepzibah had known for years had come now in the dreaded\r\ncrisis, when, for the first time, she had put forth her hand to help herself.\r\nThe little circlet of the schoolboy’s copper coin—dim and\r\nlustreless though it was, with the small services which it had been doing here\r\nand there about the world—had proved a talisman, fragrant with good, and\r\ndeserving to be set in gold and worn next her heart. It was as potent, and\r\nperhaps endowed with the same kind of efficacy, as a galvanic ring! Hepzibah,\r\nat all events, was indebted to its subtile operation both in body and spirit;\r\nso much the more, as it inspired her with energy to get some breakfast, at\r\nwhich, still the better to keep up her courage, she allowed herself an extra\r\nspoonful in her infusion of black tea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer introductory day of shop-keeping did not run on, however, without many and\r\nserious interruptions of this mood of cheerful vigor. As a general rule,\r\nProvidence seldom vouchsafes to mortals any more than just that degree of\r\nencouragement which suffices to keep them at a reasonably full exertion of\r\ntheir powers. In the case of our old gentlewoman, after the excitement of new\r\neffort had subsided, the despondency of her whole life threatened, ever and\r\nanon, to return. It was like the heavy mass of clouds which we may often see\r\nobscuring the sky, and making a gray twilight everywhere, until, towards\r\nnightfall, it yields temporarily to a glimpse of sunshine. But, always, the\r\nenvious cloud strives to gather again across the streak of celestial azure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCustomers came in, as the forenoon advanced, but rather slowly; in some cases,\r\ntoo, it must be owned, with little satisfaction either to themselves or Miss\r\nHepzibah; nor, on the whole, with an aggregate of very rich emolument to the\r\ntill. A little girl, sent by her mother to match a skein of cotton thread, of a\r\npeculiar hue, took one that the near-sighted old lady pronounced extremely\r\nlike, but soon came running back, with a blunt and cross message, that it would\r\nnot do, and, besides, was very rotten! Then, there was a pale, care-wrinkled\r\nwoman, not old but haggard, and already with streaks of gray among her hair,\r\nlike silver ribbons; one of those women, naturally delicate, whom you at once\r\nrecognize as worn to death by a brute—probably a drunken brute—of a\r\nhusband, and at least nine children. She wanted a few pounds of flour, and\r\noffered the money, which the decayed gentlewoman silently rejected, and gave\r\nthe poor soul better measure than if she had taken it. Shortly afterwards, a\r\nman in a blue cotton frock, much soiled, came in and bought a pipe, filling the\r\nwhole shop, meanwhile, with the hot odor of strong drink, not only exhaled in\r\nthe torrid atmosphere of his breath, but oozing out of his entire system, like\r\nan inflammable gas. It was impressed on Hepzibah’s mind that this was the\r\nhusband of the care-wrinkled woman. He asked for a paper of tobacco; and as she\r\nhad neglected to provide herself with the article, her brutal customer dashed\r\ndown his newly-bought pipe and left the shop, muttering some unintelligible\r\nwords, which had the tone and bitterness of a curse. Hereupon Hepzibah threw up\r\nher eyes, unintentionally scowling in the face of Providence!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo less than five persons, during the forenoon, inquired for ginger-beer, or\r\nroot-beer, or any drink of a similar brewage, and, obtaining nothing of the\r\nkind, went off in an exceedingly bad humor. Three of them left the door open,\r\nand the other two pulled it so spitefully in going out that the little bell\r\nplayed the very deuce with Hepzibah’s nerves. A round, bustling,\r\nfire-ruddy housewife of the neighborhood burst breathless into the shop,\r\nfiercely demanding yeast; and when the poor gentlewoman, with her cold shyness\r\nof manner, gave her hot customer to understand that she did not keep the\r\narticle, this very capable housewife took upon herself to administer a regular\r\nrebuke.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A cent-shop, and no yeast!” quoth she; “That will never do!\r\nWho ever heard of such a thing? Your loaf will never rise, no more than mine\r\nwill to-day. You had better shut up shop at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” said Hepzibah, heaving a deep sigh, “perhaps I\r\nhad!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral times, moreover, besides the above instance, her lady-like\r\nsensibilities were seriously infringed upon by the familiar, if not rude, tone\r\nwith which people addressed her. They evidently considered themselves not\r\nmerely her equals, but her patrons and superiors. Now, Hepzibah had\r\nunconsciously flattered herself with the idea that there would be a gleam or\r\nhalo, of some kind or other, about her person, which would insure an obeisance\r\nto her sterling gentility, or, at least, a tacit recognition of it. On the\r\nother hand, nothing tortured her more intolerably than when this recognition\r\nwas too prominently expressed. To one or two rather officious offers of\r\nsympathy, her responses were little short of acrimonious; and, we regret to\r\nsay, Hepzibah was thrown into a positively unchristian state of mind by the\r\nsuspicion that one of her customers was drawn to the shop, not by any real need\r\nof the article which she pretended to seek, but by a wicked wish to stare at\r\nher. The vulgar creature was determined to see for herself what sort of a\r\nfigure a mildewed piece of aristocracy, after wasting all the bloom and much of\r\nthe decline of her life apart from the world, would cut behind a counter. In\r\nthis particular case, however mechanical and innocuous it might be at other\r\ntimes, Hepzibah’s contortion of brow served her in good stead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I never was so frightened in my life!” said the curious customer,\r\nin describing the incident to one of her acquaintances. “She’s a\r\nreal old vixen, take my word of it! She says little, to be sure; but if you\r\ncould only see the mischief in her eye!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the whole, therefore, her new experience led our decayed gentlewoman to very\r\ndisagreeable conclusions as to the temper and manners of what she termed the\r\nlower classes, whom heretofore she had looked down upon with a gentle and\r\npitying complaisance, as herself occupying a sphere of unquestionable\r\nsuperiority. But, unfortunately, she had likewise to struggle against a bitter\r\nemotion of a directly opposite kind: a sentiment of virulence, we mean, towards\r\nthe idle aristocracy to which it had so recently been her pride to belong. When\r\na lady, in a delicate and costly summer garb, with a floating veil and\r\ngracefully swaying gown, and, altogether, an ethereal lightness that made you\r\nlook at her beautifully slippered feet, to see whether she trod on the dust or\r\nfloated in the air,—when such a vision happened to pass through this\r\nretired street, leaving it tenderly and delusively fragrant with her passage,\r\nas if a bouquet of tea-roses had been borne along,—then again, it is to\r\nbe feared, old Hepzibah’s scowl could no longer vindicate itself entirely\r\non the plea of near-sightedness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For what end,” thought she, giving vent to that feeling of\r\nhostility which is the only real abasement of the poor in presence of the\r\nrich,—“for what good end, in the wisdom of Providence, does that\r\nwoman live? Must the whole world toil, that the palms of her hands may be kept\r\nwhite and delicate?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen, ashamed and penitent, she hid her face.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“May God forgive me!” said she.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDoubtless, God did forgive her. But, taking the inward and outward history of\r\nthe first half-day into consideration, Hepzibah began to fear that the shop\r\nwould prove her ruin in a moral and religious point of view, without\r\ncontributing very essentially towards even her temporal welfare.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap04\"></a>IV.<br>\r\nA Day Behind the Counter</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTowards noon, Hepzibah saw an elderly gentleman, large and portly, and of\r\nremarkably dignified demeanor, passing slowly along on the opposite side of the\r\nwhite and dusty street. On coming within the shadow of the Pyncheon Elm, he\r\nstopt, and (taking off his hat, meanwhile, to wipe the perspiration from his\r\nbrow) seemed to scrutinize, with especial interest, the dilapidated and\r\nrusty-visaged House of the Seven Gables. He himself, in a very different style,\r\nwas as well worth looking at as the house. No better model need be sought, nor\r\ncould have been found, of a very high order of respectability, which, by some\r\nindescribable magic, not merely expressed itself in his looks and gestures, but\r\neven governed the fashion of his garments, and rendered them all proper and\r\nessential to the man. Without appearing to differ, in any tangible way, from\r\nother people’s clothes, there was yet a wide and rich gravity about them\r\nthat must have been a characteristic of the wearer, since it could not be\r\ndefined as pertaining either to the cut or material. His gold-headed cane,\r\ntoo,—a serviceable staff, of dark polished wood,—had similar\r\ntraits, and, had it chosen to take a walk by itself, would have been recognized\r\nanywhere as a tolerably adequate representative of its master. This\r\ncharacter—which showed itself so strikingly in everything about him, and\r\nthe effect of which we seek to convey to the reader—went no deeper than\r\nhis station, habits of life, and external circumstances. One perceived him to\r\nbe a personage of marked influence and authority; and, especially, you could\r\nfeel just as certain that he was opulent as if he had exhibited his bank\r\naccount, or as if you had seen him touching the twigs of the Pyncheon Elm, and,\r\nMidas-like, transmuting them to gold.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his youth, he had probably been considered a handsome man; at his present\r\nage, his brow was too heavy, his temples too bare, his remaining hair too gray,\r\nhis eye too cold, his lips too closely compressed, to bear any relation to mere\r\npersonal beauty. He would have made a good and massive portrait; better now,\r\nperhaps, than at any previous period of his life, although his look might grow\r\npositively harsh in the process of being fixed upon the canvas. The artist\r\nwould have found it desirable to study his face, and prove its capacity for\r\nvaried expression; to darken it with a frown,—to kindle it up with a\r\nsmile.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile the elderly gentleman stood looking at the Pyncheon House, both the frown\r\nand the smile passed successively over his countenance. His eye rested on the\r\nshop-window, and putting up a pair of gold-bowed spectacles, which he held in\r\nhis hand, he minutely surveyed Hepzibah’s little arrangement of toys and\r\ncommodities. At first it seemed not to please him,—nay, to cause him\r\nexceeding displeasure,—and yet, the very next moment, he smiled. While\r\nthe latter expression was yet on his lips, he caught a glimpse of Hepzibah, who\r\nhad involuntarily bent forward to the window; and then the smile changed from\r\nacrid and disagreeable to the sunniest complacency and benevolence. He bowed,\r\nwith a happy mixture of dignity and courteous kindliness, and pursued his way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There he is!” said Hepzibah to herself, gulping down a very bitter\r\nemotion, and, since she could not rid herself of it, trying to drive it back\r\ninto her heart. “What does he think of it, I wonder? Does it please him?\r\nAh! he is looking back!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe gentleman had paused in the street, and turned himself half about, still\r\nwith his eyes fixed on the shop-window. In fact, he wheeled wholly round, and\r\ncommenced a step or two, as if designing to enter the shop; but, as it chanced,\r\nhis purpose was anticipated by Hepzibah’s first customer, the little\r\ncannibal of Jim Crow, who, staring up at the window, was irresistibly attracted\r\nby an elephant of gingerbread. What a grand appetite had this small\r\nurchin!—Two Jim Crows immediately after breakfast!—and now an\r\nelephant, as a preliminary whet before dinner. By the time this latter purchase\r\nwas completed, the elderly gentleman had resumed his way, and turned the street\r\ncorner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Take it as you like, Cousin Jaffrey,” muttered the maiden lady, as\r\nshe drew back, after cautiously thrusting out her head, and looking up and down\r\nthe street,—“Take it as you like! You have seen my little\r\nshop-window. Well!—what have you to say?—is not the Pyncheon House\r\nmy own, while I’m alive?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter this incident, Hepzibah retreated to the back parlor, where she at first\r\ncaught up a half-finished stocking, and began knitting at it with nervous and\r\nirregular jerks; but quickly finding herself at odds with the stitches, she\r\nthrew it aside, and walked hurriedly about the room. At length she paused\r\nbefore the portrait of the stern old Puritan, her ancestor, and the founder of\r\nthe house. In one sense, this picture had almost faded into the canvas, and\r\nhidden itself behind the duskiness of age; in another, she could not but fancy\r\nthat it had been growing more prominent and strikingly expressive, ever since\r\nher earliest familiarity with it as a child. For, while the physical outline\r\nand substance were darkening away from the beholder’s eye, the bold,\r\nhard, and, at the same time, indirect character of the man seemed to be brought\r\nout in a kind of spiritual relief. Such an effect may occasionally be observed\r\nin pictures of antique date. They acquire a look which an artist (if he have\r\nanything like the complacency of artists nowadays) would never dream of\r\npresenting to a patron as his own characteristic expression, but which,\r\nnevertheless, we at once recognize as reflecting the unlovely truth of a human\r\nsoul. In such cases, the painter’s deep conception of his subject’s\r\ninward traits has wrought itself into the essence of the picture, and is seen\r\nafter the superficial coloring has been rubbed off by time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile gazing at the portrait, Hepzibah trembled under its eye. Her hereditary\r\nreverence made her afraid to judge the character of the original so harshly as\r\na perception of the truth compelled her to do. But still she gazed, because the\r\nface of the picture enabled her—at least, she fancied so—to read\r\nmore accurately, and to a greater depth, the face which she had just seen in\r\nthe street.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is the very man!” murmured she to herself. “Let Jaffrey\r\nPyncheon smile as he will, there is that look beneath! Put on him a skull-cap,\r\nand a band, and a black cloak, and a Bible in one hand and a sword in the\r\nother,—then let Jaffrey smile as he might,—nobody would doubt that\r\nit was the old Pyncheon come again. He has proved himself the very man to build\r\nup a new house! Perhaps, too, to draw down a new curse!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus did Hepzibah bewilder herself with these fantasies of the old time. She\r\nhad dwelt too much alone,—too long in the Pyncheon House,—until her\r\nvery brain was impregnated with the dry-rot of its timbers. She needed a walk\r\nalong the noonday street to keep her sane.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the spell of contrast, another portrait rose up before her, painted with\r\nmore daring flattery than any artist would have ventured upon, but yet so\r\ndelicately touched that the likeness remained perfect. Malbone’s\r\nminiature, though from the same original, was far inferior to Hepzibah’s\r\nair-drawn picture, at which affection and sorrowful remembrance wrought\r\ntogether. Soft, mildly, and cheerfully contemplative, with full, red lips, just\r\non the verge of a smile, which the eyes seemed to herald by a gentle\r\nkindling-up of their orbs! Feminine traits, moulded inseparably with those of\r\nthe other sex! The miniature, likewise, had this last peculiarity; so that you\r\ninevitably thought of the original as resembling his mother, and she a lovely\r\nand lovable woman, with perhaps some beautiful infirmity of character, that\r\nmade it all the pleasanter to know and easier to love her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” thought Hepzibah, with grief of which it was only the more\r\ntolerable portion that welled up from her heart to her eyelids, “they\r\npersecuted his mother in him! He never was a Pyncheon!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut here the shop-bell rang; it was like a sound from a remote\r\ndistance,—so far had Hepzibah descended into the sepulchral depths of her\r\nreminiscences. On entering the shop, she found an old man there, a humble\r\nresident of Pyncheon Street, and whom, for a great many years past, she had\r\nsuffered to be a kind of familiar of the house. He was an immemorial personage,\r\nwho seemed always to have had a white head and wrinkles, and never to have\r\npossessed but a single tooth, and that a half-decayed one, in the front of the\r\nupper jaw. Well advanced as Hepzibah was, she could not remember when Uncle\r\nVenner, as the neighborhood called him, had not gone up and down the street,\r\nstooping a little and drawing his feet heavily over the gravel or pavement. But\r\nstill there was something tough and vigorous about him, that not only kept him\r\nin daily breath, but enabled him to fill a place which would else have been\r\nvacant in the apparently crowded world. To go of errands with his slow and\r\nshuffling gait, which made you doubt how he ever was to arrive anywhere; to saw\r\na small household’s foot or two of firewood, or knock to pieces an old\r\nbarrel, or split up a pine board for kindling-stuff; in summer, to dig the few\r\nyards of garden ground appertaining to a low-rented tenement, and share the\r\nproduce of his labor at the halves; in winter, to shovel away the snow from the\r\nsidewalk, or open paths to the woodshed, or along the clothes-line; such were\r\nsome of the essential offices which Uncle Venner performed among at least a\r\nscore of families. Within that circle, he claimed the same sort of privilege,\r\nand probably felt as much warmth of interest, as a clergyman does in the range\r\nof his parishioners. Not that he laid claim to the tithe pig; but, as an\r\nanalogous mode of reverence, he went his rounds, every morning, to gather up\r\nthe crumbs of the table and overflowings of the dinner-pot, as food for a pig\r\nof his own.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn his younger days—for, after all, there was a dim tradition that he had\r\nbeen, not young, but younger—Uncle Venner was commonly regarded as rather\r\ndeficient, than otherwise, in his wits. In truth he had virtually pleaded\r\nguilty to the charge, by scarcely aiming at such success as other men seek, and\r\nby taking only that humble and modest part in the intercourse of life which\r\nbelongs to the alleged deficiency. But now, in his extreme old\r\nage,—whether it were that his long and hard experience had actually\r\nbrightened him, or that his decaying judgment rendered him less capable of\r\nfairly measuring himself,—the venerable man made pretensions to no little\r\nwisdom, and really enjoyed the credit of it. There was likewise, at times, a\r\nvein of something like poetry in him; it was the moss or wall-flower of his\r\nmind in its small dilapidation, and gave a charm to what might have been vulgar\r\nand commonplace in his earlier and middle life. Hepzibah had a regard for him,\r\nbecause his name was ancient in the town and had formerly been respectable. It\r\nwas a still better reason for awarding him a species of familiar reverence that\r\nUncle Venner was himself the most ancient existence, whether of man or thing,\r\nin Pyncheon Street, except the House of the Seven Gables, and perhaps the elm\r\nthat overshadowed it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis patriarch now presented himself before Hepzibah, clad in an old blue coat,\r\nwhich had a fashionable air, and must have accrued to him from the cast-off\r\nwardrobe of some dashing clerk. As for his trousers, they were of tow-cloth,\r\nvery short in the legs, and bagging down strangely in the rear, but yet having\r\na suitableness to his figure which his other garment entirely lacked. His hat\r\nhad relation to no other part of his dress, and but very little to the head\r\nthat wore it. Thus Uncle Venner was a miscellaneous old gentleman, partly\r\nhimself, but, in good measure, somebody else; patched together, too, of\r\ndifferent epochs; an epitome of times and fashions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“So, you have really begun trade,” said he,—“really\r\nbegun trade! Well, I’m glad to see it. Young people should never live\r\nidle in the world, nor old ones neither, unless when the rheumatize gets hold\r\nof them. It has given me warning already; and in two or three years longer, I\r\nshall think of putting aside business and retiring to my farm. That’s\r\nyonder,—the great brick house, you know,—the workhouse, most folks\r\ncall it; but I mean to do my work first, and go there to be idle and enjoy\r\nmyself. And I’m glad to see you beginning to do your work, Miss\r\nHepzibah!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thank you, Uncle Venner” said Hepzibah, smiling; for she always\r\nfelt kindly towards the simple and talkative old man. Had he been an old woman,\r\nshe might probably have repelled the freedom, which she now took in good part.\r\n“It is time for me to begin work, indeed! Or, to speak the truth, I have\r\njust begun when I ought to be giving it up.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, never say that, Miss Hepzibah!” answered the old man.\r\n“You are a young woman yet. Why, I hardly thought myself younger than I\r\nam now, it seems so little while ago since I used to see you playing about the\r\ndoor of the old house, quite a small child! Oftener, though, you used to be\r\nsitting at the threshold, and looking gravely into the street; for you had\r\nalways a grave kind of way with you,—a grown-up air, when you were only\r\nthe height of my knee. It seems as if I saw you now; and your grandfather with\r\nhis red cloak, and his white wig, and his cocked hat, and his cane, coming out\r\nof the house, and stepping so grandly up the street! Those old gentlemen that\r\ngrew up before the Revolution used to put on grand airs. In my young days, the\r\ngreat man of the town was commonly called King; and his wife, not Queen to be\r\nsure, but Lady. Nowadays, a man would not dare to be called King; and if he\r\nfeels himself a little above common folks, he only stoops so much the lower to\r\nthem. I met your cousin, the Judge, ten minutes ago; and, in my old tow-cloth\r\ntrousers, as you see, the Judge raised his hat to me, I do believe! At any\r\nrate, the Judge bowed and smiled!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” said Hepzibah, with something bitter stealing unawares into\r\nher tone; “my cousin Jaffrey is thought to have a very pleasant\r\nsmile!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And so he has” replied Uncle Venner. “And that’s\r\nrather remarkable in a Pyncheon; for, begging your pardon, Miss Hepzibah, they\r\nnever had the name of being an easy and agreeable set of folks. There was no\r\ngetting close to them. But Now, Miss Hepzibah, if an old man may be bold to\r\nask, why don’t Judge Pyncheon, with his great means, step forward, and\r\ntell his cousin to shut up her little shop at once? It’s for your credit\r\nto be doing something, but it’s not for the Judge’s credit to let\r\nyou!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We won’t talk of this, if you please, Uncle Venner,” said\r\nHepzibah coldly. “I ought to say, however, that, if I choose to earn\r\nbread for myself, it is not Judge Pyncheon’s fault. Neither will he\r\ndeserve the blame,” added she more kindly, remembering Uncle\r\nVenner’s privileges of age and humble familiarity, “if I should, by\r\nand by, find it convenient to retire with you to your farm.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And it’s no bad place, either, that farm of mine!” cried the\r\nold man cheerily, as if there were something positively delightful in the\r\nprospect. “No bad place is the great brick farm-house, especially for\r\nthem that will find a good many old cronies there, as will be my case. I quite\r\nlong to be among them, sometimes, of the winter evenings; for it is but dull\r\nbusiness for a lonesome elderly man, like me, to be nodding, by the hour\r\ntogether, with no company but his air-tight stove. Summer or winter,\r\nthere’s a great deal to be said in favor of my farm! And, take it in the\r\nautumn, what can be pleasanter than to spend a whole day on the sunny side of a\r\nbarn or a wood-pile, chatting with somebody as old as one’s self; or,\r\nperhaps, idling away the time with a natural-born simpleton, who knows how to\r\nbe idle, because even our busy Yankees never have found out how to put him to\r\nany use? Upon my word, Miss Hepzibah, I doubt whether I’ve ever been so\r\ncomfortable as I mean to be at my farm, which most folks call the workhouse.\r\nBut you,—you’re a young woman yet,—you never need go there!\r\nSomething still better will turn up for you. I’m sure of it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah fancied that there was something peculiar in her venerable\r\nfriend’s look and tone; insomuch, that she gazed into his face with\r\nconsiderable earnestness, endeavoring to discover what secret meaning, if any,\r\nmight be lurking there. Individuals whose affairs have reached an utterly\r\ndesperate crisis almost invariably keep themselves alive with hopes, so much\r\nthe more airily magnificent as they have the less of solid matter within their\r\ngrasp whereof to mould any judicious and moderate expectation of good. Thus,\r\nall the while Hepzibah was perfecting the scheme of her little shop, she had\r\ncherished an unacknowledged idea that some harlequin trick of fortune would\r\nintervene in her favor. For example, an uncle—who had sailed for India\r\nfifty years before, and never been heard of since—might yet return, and\r\nadopt her to be the comfort of his very extreme and decrepit age, and adorn her\r\nwith pearls, diamonds, and Oriental shawls and turbans, and make her the\r\nultimate heiress of his unreckonable riches. Or the member of Parliament, now\r\nat the head of the English branch of the family,—with which the elder\r\nstock, on this side of the Atlantic, had held little or no intercourse for the\r\nlast two centuries,—this eminent gentleman might invite Hepzibah to quit\r\nthe ruinous House of the Seven Gables, and come over to dwell with her kindred\r\nat Pyncheon Hall. But, for reasons the most imperative, she could not yield to\r\nhis request. It was more probable, therefore, that the descendants of a\r\nPyncheon who had emigrated to Virginia, in some past generation, and became a\r\ngreat planter there,—hearing of Hepzibah’s destitution, and\r\nimpelled by the splendid generosity of character with which their Virginian\r\nmixture must have enriched the New England blood,—would send her a\r\nremittance of a thousand dollars, with a hint of repeating the favor annually.\r\nOr,—and, surely, anything so undeniably just could not be beyond the\r\nlimits of reasonable anticipation,—the great claim to the heritage of\r\nWaldo County might finally be decided in favor of the Pyncheons; so that,\r\ninstead of keeping a cent-shop, Hepzibah would build a palace, and look down\r\nfrom its highest tower on hill, dale, forest, field, and town, as her own share\r\nof the ancestral territory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese were some of the fantasies which she had long dreamed about; and, aided\r\nby these, Uncle Venner’s casual attempt at encouragement kindled a\r\nstrange festal glory in the poor, bare, melancholy chambers of her brain, as if\r\nthat inner world were suddenly lighted up with gas. But either he knew nothing\r\nof her castles in the air,—as how should he?—or else her earnest\r\nscowl disturbed his recollection, as it might a more courageous man’s.\r\nInstead of pursuing any weightier topic, Uncle Venner was pleased to favor\r\nHepzibah with some sage counsel in her shop-keeping capacity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Give no credit!”—these were some of his golden\r\nmaxims,—“Never take paper-money. Look well to your change! Ring the\r\nsilver on the four-pound weight! Shove back all English half-pence and base\r\ncopper tokens, such as are very plenty about town! At your leisure hours, knit\r\nchildren’s woollen socks and mittens! Brew your own yeast, and make your\r\nown ginger-beer!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd while Hepzibah was doing her utmost to digest the hard little pellets of\r\nhis already uttered wisdom, he gave vent to his final, and what he declared to\r\nbe his all-important advice, as follows:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Put on a bright face for your customers, and smile pleasantly as you\r\nhand them what they ask for! A stale article, if you dip it in a good, warm,\r\nsunny smile, will go off better than a fresh one that you’ve scowled\r\nupon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo this last apothegm poor Hepzibah responded with a sigh so deep and heavy\r\nthat it almost rustled Uncle Venner quite away, like a withered leaf,—as\r\nhe was,—before an autumnal gale. Recovering himself, however, he bent\r\nforward, and, with a good deal of feeling in his ancient visage, beckoned her\r\nnearer to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When do you expect him home?” whispered he.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Whom do you mean?” asked Hepzibah, turning pale.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah!—You don’t love to talk about it,” said Uncle\r\nVenner. “Well, well! we’ll say no more, though there’s word\r\nof it all over town. I remember him, Miss Hepzibah, before he could run\r\nalone!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the remainder of the day, poor Hepzibah acquitted herself even less\r\ncreditably, as a shop-keeper, than in her earlier efforts. She appeared to be\r\nwalking in a dream; or, more truly, the vivid life and reality assumed by her\r\nemotions made all outward occurrences unsubstantial, like the teasing phantasms\r\nof a half-conscious slumber. She still responded, mechanically, to the frequent\r\nsummons of the shop-bell, and, at the demand of her customers, went prying with\r\nvague eyes about the shop, proffering them one article after another, and\r\nthrusting aside—perversely, as most of them supposed—the identical\r\nthing they asked for. There is sad confusion, indeed, when the spirit thus\r\nflits away into the past, or into the more awful future, or, in any manner,\r\nsteps across the spaceless boundary betwixt its own region and the actual\r\nworld; where the body remains to guide itself as best it may, with little more\r\nthan the mechanism of animal life. It is like death, without death’s\r\nquiet privilege,—its freedom from mortal care. Worst of all, when the\r\nactual duties are comprised in such petty details as now vexed the brooding\r\nsoul of the old gentlewoman. As the animosity of fate would have it, there was\r\na great influx of custom in the course of the afternoon. Hepzibah blundered to\r\nand fro about her small place of business, committing the most unheard-of\r\nerrors: now stringing up twelve, and now seven, tallow-candles, instead of ten\r\nto the pound; selling ginger for Scotch snuff, pins for needles, and needles\r\nfor pins; misreckoning her change, sometimes to the public detriment, and much\r\noftener to her own; and thus she went on, doing her utmost to bring chaos back\r\nagain, until, at the close of the day’s labor, to her inexplicable\r\nastonishment, she found the money-drawer almost destitute of coin. After all\r\nher painful traffic, the whole proceeds were perhaps half a dozen coppers, and\r\na questionable ninepence which ultimately proved to be copper likewise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt this price, or at whatever price, she rejoiced that the day had reached its\r\nend. Never before had she had such a sense of the intolerable length of time\r\nthat creeps between dawn and sunset, and of the miserable irksomeness of having\r\naught to do, and of the better wisdom that it would be to lie down at once, in\r\nsullen resignation, and let life, and its toils and vexations, trample over\r\none’s prostrate body as they may! Hepzibah’s final operation was\r\nwith the little devourer of Jim Crow and the elephant, who now proposed to eat\r\na camel. In her bewilderment, she offered him first a wooden dragoon, and next\r\na handful of marbles; neither of which being adapted to his else omnivorous\r\nappetite, she hastily held out her whole remaining stock of natural history in\r\ngingerbread, and huddled the small customer out of the shop. She then muffled\r\nthe bell in an unfinished stocking, and put up the oaken bar across the door.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the latter process, an omnibus came to a stand-still under the branches\r\nof the elm-tree. Hepzibah’s heart was in her mouth. Remote and dusky, and\r\nwith no sunshine on all the intervening space, was that region of the Past\r\nwhence her only guest might be expected to arrive! Was she to meet him now?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSomebody, at all events, was passing from the farthest interior of the omnibus\r\ntowards its entrance. A gentleman alighted; but it was only to offer his hand\r\nto a young girl whose slender figure, nowise needing such assistance, now\r\nlightly descended the steps, and made an airy little jump from the final one to\r\nthe sidewalk. She rewarded her cavalier with a smile, the cheery glow of which\r\nwas seen reflected on his own face as he reentered the vehicle. The girl then\r\nturned towards the House of the Seven Gables, to the door of which,\r\nmeanwhile,—not the shop-door, but the antique portal,—the\r\nomnibus-man had carried a light trunk and a bandbox. First giving a sharp rap\r\nof the old iron knocker, he left his passenger and her luggage at the\r\ndoor-step, and departed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who can it be?” thought Hepzibah, who had been screwing her visual\r\norgans into the acutest focus of which they were capable. “The girl must\r\nhave mistaken the house.” She stole softly into the hall, and, herself\r\ninvisible, gazed through the dusty side-lights of the portal at the young,\r\nblooming, and very cheerful face which presented itself for admittance into the\r\ngloomy old mansion. It was a face to which almost any door would have opened of\r\nits own accord.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe young girl, so fresh, so unconventional, and yet so orderly and obedient to\r\ncommon rules, as you at once recognized her to be, was widely in contrast, at\r\nthat moment, with everything about her. The sordid and ugly luxuriance of\r\ngigantic weeds that grew in the angle of the house, and the heavy projection\r\nthat overshadowed her, and the time-worn framework of the door,—none of\r\nthese things belonged to her sphere. But, even as a ray of sunshine, fall into\r\nwhat dismal place it may, instantaneously creates for itself a propriety in\r\nbeing there, so did it seem altogether fit that the girl should be standing at\r\nthe threshold. It was no less evidently proper that the door should swing open\r\nto admit her. The maiden lady herself, sternly inhospitable in her first\r\npurposes, soon began to feel that the door ought to be shoved back, and the\r\nrusty key be turned in the reluctant lock.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can it be Phœbe?” questioned she within herself. “It must\r\nbe little Phœbe; for it can be nobody else,—and there is a look of her\r\nfather about her, too! But what does she want here? And how like a country\r\ncousin, to come down upon a poor body in this way, without so much as a\r\nday’s notice, or asking whether she would be welcome! Well; she must have\r\na night’s lodging, I suppose; and to-morrow the child shall go back to\r\nher mother.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe, it must be understood, was that one little offshoot of the Pyncheon\r\nrace to whom we have already referred, as a native of a rural part of New\r\nEngland, where the old fashions and feelings of relationship are still\r\npartially kept up. In her own circle, it was regarded as by no means improper\r\nfor kinsfolk to visit one another without invitation, or preliminary and\r\nceremonious warning. Yet, in consideration of Miss Hepzibah’s recluse way\r\nof life, a letter had actually been written and despatched, conveying\r\ninformation of Phœbe’s projected visit. This epistle, for three or four\r\ndays past, had been in the pocket of the penny-postman, who, happening to have\r\nno other business in Pyncheon Street, had not yet made it convenient to call at\r\nthe House of the Seven Gables.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No—she can stay only one night,” said Hepzibah, unbolting\r\nthe door. “If Clifford were to find her here, it might disturb\r\nhim!”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap05\"></a>V.<br>\r\nMay and November</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe Pyncheon slept, on the night of her arrival, in a chamber that looked\r\ndown on the garden of the old house. It fronted towards the east, so that at a\r\nvery seasonable hour a glow of crimson light came flooding through the window,\r\nand bathed the dingy ceiling and paper-hangings in its own hue. There were\r\ncurtains to Phœbe’s bed; a dark, antique canopy, and ponderous festoons\r\nof a stuff which had been rich, and even magnificent, in its time; but which\r\nnow brooded over the girl like a cloud, making a night in that one corner,\r\nwhile elsewhere it was beginning to be day. The morning light, however, soon\r\nstole into the aperture at the foot of the bed, betwixt those faded curtains.\r\nFinding the new guest there,—with a bloom on her cheeks like the\r\nmorning’s own, and a gentle stir of departing slumber in her limbs, as\r\nwhen an early breeze moves the foliage,—the dawn kissed her brow. It was\r\nthe caress which a dewy maiden—such as the Dawn is,\r\nimmortally—gives to her sleeping sister, partly from the impulse of\r\nirresistible fondness, and partly as a pretty hint that it is time now to\r\nunclose her eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the touch of those lips of light, Phœbe quietly awoke, and, for a moment,\r\ndid not recognize where she was, nor how those heavy curtains chanced to be\r\nfestooned around her. Nothing, indeed, was absolutely plain to her, except that\r\nit was now early morning, and that, whatever might happen next, it was proper,\r\nfirst of all, to get up and say her prayers. She was the more inclined to\r\ndevotion from the grim aspect of the chamber and its furniture, especially the\r\ntall, stiff chairs; one of which stood close by her bedside, and looked as if\r\nsome old-fashioned personage had been sitting there all night, and had vanished\r\nonly just in season to escape discovery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Phœbe was quite dressed, she peeped out of the window, and saw a rosebush\r\nin the garden. Being a very tall one, and of luxuriant growth, it had been\r\npropped up against the side of the house, and was literally covered with a rare\r\nand very beautiful species of white rose. A large portion of them, as the girl\r\nafterwards discovered, had blight or mildew at their hearts; but, viewed at a\r\nfair distance, the whole rosebush looked as if it had been brought from Eden\r\nthat very summer, together with the mould in which it grew. The truth was,\r\nnevertheless, that it had been planted by Alice Pyncheon,—she was\r\nPhœbe’s great-great-grand-aunt,—in soil which, reckoning only its\r\ncultivation as a garden-plat, was now unctuous with nearly two hundred years of\r\nvegetable decay. Growing as they did, however, out of the old earth, the\r\nflowers still sent a fresh and sweet incense up to their Creator; nor could it\r\nhave been the less pure and acceptable because Phœbe’s young breath\r\nmingled with it, as the fragrance floated past the window. Hastening down the\r\ncreaking and carpetless staircase, she found her way into the garden, gathered\r\nsome of the most perfect of the roses, and brought them to her chamber.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLittle Phœbe was one of those persons who possess, as their exclusive\r\npatrimony, the gift of practical arrangement. It is a kind of natural magic\r\nthat enables these favored ones to bring out the hidden capabilities of things\r\naround them; and particularly to give a look of comfort and habitableness to\r\nany place which, for however brief a period, may happen to be their home. A\r\nwild hut of underbrush, tossed together by wayfarers through the primitive\r\nforest, would acquire the home aspect by one night’s lodging of such a\r\nwoman, and would retain it long after her quiet figure had disappeared into the\r\nsurrounding shade. No less a portion of such homely witchcraft was requisite to\r\nreclaim, as it were, Phœbe’s waste, cheerless, and dusky chamber, which\r\nhad been untenanted so long—except by spiders, and mice, and rats, and\r\nghosts—that it was all overgrown with the desolation which watches to\r\nobliterate every trace of man’s happier hours. What was precisely\r\nPhœbe’s process we find it impossible to say. She appeared to have no\r\npreliminary design, but gave a touch here and another there; brought some\r\narticles of furniture to light and dragged others into the shadow; looped up or\r\nlet down a window-curtain; and, in the course of half an hour, had fully\r\nsucceeded in throwing a kindly and hospitable smile over the apartment. No\r\nlonger ago than the night before, it had resembled nothing so much as the old\r\nmaid’s heart; for there was neither sunshine nor household fire in one\r\nnor the other, and, save for ghosts and ghostly reminiscences, not a guest, for\r\nmany years gone by, had entered the heart or the chamber.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was still another peculiarity of this inscrutable charm. The bedchamber,\r\nno doubt, was a chamber of very great and varied experience, as a scene of\r\nhuman life: the joy of bridal nights had throbbed itself away here; new\r\nimmortals had first drawn earthly breath here; and here old people had died.\r\nBut—whether it were the white roses, or whatever the subtile influence\r\nmight be—a person of delicate instinct would have known at once that it\r\nwas now a maiden’s bedchamber, and had been purified of all former evil\r\nand sorrow by her sweet breath and happy thoughts. Her dreams of the past\r\nnight, being such cheerful ones, had exorcised the gloom, and now haunted the\r\nchamber in its stead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter arranging matters to her satisfaction, Phœbe emerged from her chamber,\r\nwith a purpose to descend again into the garden. Besides the rosebush, she had\r\nobserved several other species of flowers growing there in a wilderness of\r\nneglect, and obstructing one another’s development (as is often the\r\nparallel case in human society) by their uneducated entanglement and confusion.\r\nAt the head of the stairs, however, she met Hepzibah, who, it being still\r\nearly, invited her into a room which she would probably have called her\r\nboudoir, had her education embraced any such French phrase. It was strewn about\r\nwith a few old books, and a work-basket, and a dusty writing-desk; and had, on\r\none side, a large black article of furniture, of very strange appearance, which\r\nthe old gentlewoman told Phœbe was a harpsichord. It looked more like a coffin\r\nthan anything else; and, indeed,—not having been played upon, or opened,\r\nfor years,—there must have been a vast deal of dead music in it, stifled\r\nfor want of air. Human finger was hardly known to have touched its chords since\r\nthe days of Alice Pyncheon, who had learned the sweet accomplishment of melody\r\nin Europe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah bade her young guest sit down, and, herself taking a chair near by,\r\nlooked as earnestly at Phœbe’s trim little figure as if she expected to\r\nsee right into its springs and motive secrets.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Cousin Phœbe,” said she, at last, “I really can’t see\r\nmy way clear to keep you with me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese words, however, had not the inhospitable bluntness with which they may\r\nstrike the reader; for the two relatives, in a talk before bedtime, had arrived\r\nat a certain degree of mutual understanding. Hepzibah knew enough to enable her\r\nto appreciate the circumstances (resulting from the second marriage of the\r\ngirl’s mother) which made it desirable for Phœbe to establish herself in\r\nanother home. Nor did she misinterpret Phœbe’s character, and the genial\r\nactivity pervading it,—one of the most valuable traits of the true New\r\nEngland woman,—which had impelled her forth, as might be said, to seek\r\nher fortune, but with a self-respecting purpose to confer as much benefit as\r\nshe could anywise receive. As one of her nearest kindred, she had naturally\r\nbetaken herself to Hepzibah, with no idea of forcing herself on her\r\ncousin’s protection, but only for a visit of a week or two, which might\r\nbe indefinitely extended, should it prove for the happiness of both.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo Hepzibah’s blunt observation, therefore, Phœbe replied as frankly,\r\nand more cheerfully.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear cousin, I cannot tell how it will be,” said she. “But I\r\nreally think we may suit one another much better than you suppose.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are a nice girl,—I see it plainly,” continued Hepzibah;\r\n“and it is not any question as to that point which makes me hesitate.\r\nBut, Phœbe, this house of mine is but a melancholy place for a young person to\r\nbe in. It lets in the wind and rain, and the snow, too, in the garret and upper\r\nchambers, in winter-time, but it never lets in the sunshine. And as for myself,\r\nyou see what I am,—a dismal and lonesome old woman (for I begin to call\r\nmyself old, Phœbe), whose temper, I am afraid, is none of the best, and whose\r\nspirits are as bad as can be! I cannot make your life pleasant, Cousin Phœbe,\r\nneither can I so much as give you bread to eat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will find me a cheerful little body” answered Phœbe, smiling,\r\nand yet with a kind of gentle dignity, “and I mean to earn my bread. You\r\nknow I have not been brought up a Pyncheon. A girl learns many things in a New\r\nEngland village.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! Phœbe,” said Hepzibah, sighing, “your knowledge would\r\ndo but little for you here! And then it is a wretched thought that you should\r\nfling away your young days in a place like this. Those cheeks would not be so\r\nrosy after a month or two. Look at my face!” and, indeed, the contrast\r\nwas very striking,—“you see how pale I am! It is my idea that the\r\ndust and continual decay of these old houses are unwholesome for the\r\nlungs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is the garden,—the flowers to be taken care of,”\r\nobserved Phœbe. “I should keep myself healthy with exercise in the open\r\nair.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And, after all, child,” exclaimed Hepzibah, suddenly rising, as if\r\nto dismiss the subject, “it is not for me to say who shall be a guest or\r\ninhabitant of the old Pyncheon House. Its master is coming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you mean Judge Pyncheon?” asked Phœbe in surprise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Judge Pyncheon!” answered her cousin angrily. “He will\r\nhardly cross the threshold while I live! No, no! But, Phœbe, you shall see the\r\nface of him I speak of.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe went in quest of the miniature already described, and returned with it in\r\nher hand. Giving it to Phœbe, she watched her features narrowly, and with a\r\ncertain jealousy as to the mode in which the girl would show herself affected\r\nby the picture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How do you like the face?” asked Hepzibah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is handsome!—it is very beautiful!” said Phœbe\r\nadmiringly. “It is as sweet a face as a man’s can be, or ought to\r\nbe. It has something of a child’s expression,—and yet not\r\nchildish,—only one feels so very kindly towards him! He ought never to\r\nsuffer anything. One would bear much for the sake of sparing him toil or\r\nsorrow. Who is it, Cousin Hepzibah?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Did you never hear,” whispered her cousin, bending towards her,\r\n“of Clifford Pyncheon?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never. I thought there were no Pyncheons left, except yourself and our\r\ncousin Jaffrey,” answered Phœbe. “And yet I seem to have heard the\r\nname of Clifford Pyncheon. Yes!—from my father or my mother; but has he\r\nnot been a long while dead?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, well, child, perhaps he has!” said Hepzibah with a sad,\r\nhollow laugh; “but, in old houses like this, you know, dead people are\r\nvery apt to come back again! We shall see. And, Cousin Phœbe, since, after all\r\nthat I have said, your courage does not fail you, we will not part so soon. You\r\nare welcome, my child, for the present, to such a home as your kinswoman can\r\noffer you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith this measured, but not exactly cold assurance of a hospitable purpose,\r\nHepzibah kissed her cheek.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey now went below stairs, where Phœbe—not so much assuming the office\r\nas attracting it to herself, by the magnetism of innate fitness—took the\r\nmost active part in preparing breakfast. The mistress of the house, meanwhile,\r\nas is usual with persons of her stiff and unmalleable cast, stood mostly aside;\r\nwilling to lend her aid, yet conscious that her natural inaptitude would be\r\nlikely to impede the business in hand. Phœbe and the fire that boiled the\r\nteakettle were equally bright, cheerful, and efficient, in their respective\r\noffices. Hepzibah gazed forth from her habitual sluggishness, the necessary\r\nresult of long solitude, as from another sphere. She could not help being\r\ninterested, however, and even amused, at the readiness with which her new\r\ninmate adapted herself to the circumstances, and brought the house, moreover,\r\nand all its rusty old appliances, into a suitableness for her purposes.\r\nWhatever she did, too, was done without conscious effort, and with frequent\r\noutbreaks of song, which were exceedingly pleasant to the ear. This natural\r\ntunefulness made Phœbe seem like a bird in a shadowy tree; or conveyed the\r\nidea that the stream of life warbled through her heart as a brook sometimes\r\nwarbles through a pleasant little dell. It betokened the cheeriness of an\r\nactive temperament, finding joy in its activity, and, therefore, rendering it\r\nbeautiful; it was a New England trait,—the stern old stuff of Puritanism\r\nwith a gold thread in the web.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah brought out some old silver spoons with the family crest upon them,\r\nand a china tea-set painted over with grotesque figures of man, bird, and\r\nbeast, in as grotesque a landscape. These pictured people were odd humorists,\r\nin a world of their own,—a world of vivid brilliancy, so far as color\r\nwent, and still unfaded, although the teapot and small cups were as ancient as\r\nthe custom itself of tea-drinking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your great-great-great-great-grandmother had these cups, when she was\r\nmarried,” said Hepzibah to Phœbe. “She was a Davenport, of a good\r\nfamily. They were almost the first teacups ever seen in the colony; and if one\r\nof them were to be broken, my heart would break with it. But it is nonsense to\r\nspeak so about a brittle teacup, when I remember what my heart has gone through\r\nwithout breaking.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe cups—not having been used, perhaps, since Hepzibah’s\r\nyouth—had contracted no small burden of dust, which Phœbe washed away\r\nwith so much care and delicacy as to satisfy even the proprietor of this\r\ninvaluable china.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What a nice little housewife you are!” exclaimed the latter,\r\nsmiling, and at the same time frowning so prodigiously that the smile was\r\nsunshine under a thunder-cloud. “Do you do other things as well? Are you\r\nas good at your book as you are at washing teacups?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not quite, I am afraid,” said Phœbe, laughing at the form of\r\nHepzibah’s question. “But I was schoolmistress for the little\r\nchildren in our district last summer, and might have been so still.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! ’tis all very well!” observed the maiden lady, drawing\r\nherself up. “But these things must have come to you with your\r\nmother’s blood. I never knew a Pyncheon that had any turn for\r\nthem.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is very queer, but not the less true, that people are generally quite as\r\nvain, or even more so, of their deficiencies than of their available gifts; as\r\nwas Hepzibah of this native inapplicability, so to speak, of the Pyncheons to\r\nany useful purpose. She regarded it as an hereditary trait; and so, perhaps, it\r\nwas, but unfortunately a morbid one, such as is often generated in families\r\nthat remain long above the surface of society.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore they left the breakfast-table, the shop-bell rang sharply, and Hepzibah\r\nset down the remnant of her final cup of tea, with a look of sallow despair\r\nthat was truly piteous to behold. In cases of distasteful occupation, the\r\nsecond day is generally worse than the first. We return to the rack with all\r\nthe soreness of the preceding torture in our limbs. At all events, Hepzibah had\r\nfully satisfied herself of the impossibility of ever becoming wonted to this\r\npeevishly obstreperous little bell. Ring as often as it might, the sound always\r\nsmote upon her nervous system rudely and suddenly. And especially now, while,\r\nwith her crested teaspoons and antique china, she was flattering herself with\r\nideas of gentility, she felt an unspeakable disinclination to confront a\r\ncustomer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do not trouble yourself, dear cousin!” cried Phœbe, starting\r\nlightly up. “I am shop-keeper to-day.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You, child!” exclaimed Hepzibah. “What can a little country\r\ngirl know of such matters?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I have done all the shopping for the family at our village\r\nstore,” said Phœbe. “And I have had a table at a fancy fair, and\r\nmade better sales than anybody. These things are not to be learnt; they depend\r\nupon a knack that comes, I suppose,” added she, smiling, “with\r\none’s mother’s blood. You shall see that I am as nice a little\r\nsaleswoman as I am a housewife!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe old gentlewoman stole behind Phœbe, and peeped from the passageway into\r\nthe shop, to note how she would manage her undertaking. It was a case of some\r\nintricacy. A very ancient woman, in a white short gown and a green petticoat,\r\nwith a string of gold beads about her neck, and what looked like a nightcap on\r\nher head, had brought a quantity of yarn to barter for the commodities of the\r\nshop. She was probably the very last person in town who still kept the\r\ntime-honored spinning-wheel in constant revolution. It was worth while to hear\r\nthe croaking and hollow tones of the old lady, and the pleasant voice of\r\nPhœbe, mingling in one twisted thread of talk; and still better to contrast\r\ntheir figures,—so light and bloomy,—so decrepit and\r\ndusky,—with only the counter betwixt them, in one sense, but more than\r\nthreescore years, in another. As for the bargain, it was wrinkled slyness and\r\ncraft pitted against native truth and sagacity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was not that well done?” asked Phœbe, laughing, when the customer\r\nwas gone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nicely done, indeed, child!” answered Hepzibah. “I could not\r\nhave gone through with it nearly so well. As you say, it must be a knack that\r\nbelongs to you on the mother’s side.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a very genuine admiration, that with which persons too shy or too awkward\r\nto take a due part in the bustling world regard the real actors in life’s\r\nstirring scenes; so genuine, in fact, that the former are usually fain to make\r\nit palatable to their self-love, by assuming that these active and forcible\r\nqualities are incompatible with others, which they choose to deem higher and\r\nmore important. Thus, Hepzibah was well content to acknowledge Phœbe’s\r\nvastly superior gifts as a shop-keeper; she listened, with compliant ear, to\r\nher suggestion of various methods whereby the influx of trade might be\r\nincreased, and rendered profitable, without a hazardous outlay of capital. She\r\nconsented that the village maiden should manufacture yeast, both liquid and in\r\ncakes; and should brew a certain kind of beer, nectareous to the palate, and of\r\nrare stomachic virtues; and, moreover, should bake and exhibit for sale some\r\nlittle spice-cakes, which whosoever tasted would longingly desire to taste\r\nagain. All such proofs of a ready mind and skilful handiwork were highly\r\nacceptable to the aristocratic hucksteress, so long as she could murmur to\r\nherself with a grim smile, and a half-natural sigh, and a sentiment of mixed\r\nwonder, pity, and growing affection:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What a nice little body she is! If she only could be a lady;\r\ntoo—but that’s impossible! Phœbe is no Pyncheon. She takes\r\neverything from her mother!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs to Phœbe’s not being a lady, or whether she were a lady or no, it was\r\na point, perhaps, difficult to decide, but which could hardly have come up for\r\njudgment at all in any fair and healthy mind. Out of New England, it would be\r\nimpossible to meet with a person combining so many ladylike attributes with so\r\nmany others that form no necessary (if compatible) part of the character. She\r\nshocked no canon of taste; she was admirably in keeping with herself, and never\r\njarred against surrounding circumstances. Her figure, to be sure,—so\r\nsmall as to be almost childlike, and so elastic that motion seemed as easy or\r\neasier to it than rest, would hardly have suited one’s idea of a\r\ncountess. Neither did her face—with the brown ringlets on either side,\r\nand the slightly piquant nose, and the wholesome bloom, and the clear shade of\r\ntan, and the half dozen freckles, friendly remembrances of the April sun and\r\nbreeze—precisely give us a right to call her beautiful. But there was\r\nboth lustre and depth in her eyes. She was very pretty; as graceful as a bird,\r\nand graceful much in the same way; as pleasant about the house as a gleam of\r\nsunshine falling on the floor through a shadow of twinkling leaves, or as a ray\r\nof firelight that dances on the wall while evening is drawing nigh. Instead of\r\ndiscussing her claim to rank among ladies, it would be preferable to regard\r\nPhœbe as the example of feminine grace and availability combined, in a state\r\nof society, if there were any such, where ladies did not exist. There it should\r\nbe woman’s office to move in the midst of practical affairs, and to gild\r\nthem all, the very homeliest,—were it even the scouring of pots and\r\nkettles,—with an atmosphere of loveliness and joy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch was the sphere of Phœbe. To find the born and educated lady, on the other\r\nhand, we need look no farther than Hepzibah, our forlorn old maid, in her\r\nrustling and rusty silks, with her deeply cherished and ridiculous\r\nconsciousness of long descent, her shadowy claims to princely territory, and,\r\nin the way of accomplishment, her recollections, it may be, of having formerly\r\nthrummed on a harpsichord, and walked a minuet, and worked an antique\r\ntapestry-stitch on her sampler. It was a fair parallel between new Plebeianism\r\nand old Gentility.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt really seemed as if the battered visage of the House of the Seven Gables,\r\nblack and heavy-browed as it still certainly looked, must have shown a kind of\r\ncheerfulness glimmering through its dusky windows as Phœbe passed to and fro\r\nin the interior. Otherwise, it is impossible to explain how the people of the\r\nneighborhood so soon became aware of the girl’s presence. There was a\r\ngreat run of custom, setting steadily in, from about ten o’clock until\r\ntowards noon,—relaxing, somewhat, at dinner-time, but recommencing in the\r\nafternoon, and, finally, dying away a half an hour or so before the long\r\nday’s sunset. One of the stanchest patrons was little Ned Higgins, the\r\ndevourer of Jim Crow and the elephant, who to-day signalized his omnivorous\r\nprowess by swallowing two dromedaries and a locomotive. Phœbe laughed, as she\r\nsummed up her aggregate of sales upon the slate; while Hepzibah, first drawing\r\non a pair of silk gloves, reckoned over the sordid accumulation of copper coin,\r\nnot without silver intermixed, that had jingled into the till.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We must renew our stock, Cousin Hepzibah!” cried the little\r\nsaleswoman. “The gingerbread figures are all gone, and so are those Dutch\r\nwooden milkmaids, and most of our other playthings. There has been constant\r\ninquiry for cheap raisins, and a great cry for whistles, and trumpets, and\r\njew’s-harps; and at least a dozen little boys have asked for\r\nmolasses-candy. And we must contrive to get a peck of russet apples, late in\r\nthe season as it is. But, dear cousin, what an enormous heap of copper!\r\nPositively a copper mountain!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well done! well done! well done!” quoth Uncle Venner, who had\r\ntaken occasion to shuffle in and out of the shop several times in the course of\r\nthe day. “Here’s a girl that will never end her days at my farm!\r\nBless my eyes, what a brisk little soul!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Phœbe is a nice girl!” said Hepzibah, with a scowl of\r\naustere approbation. “But, Uncle Venner, you have known the family a\r\ngreat many years. Can you tell me whether there ever was a Pyncheon whom she\r\ntakes after?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t believe there ever was,” answered the venerable man.\r\n“At any rate, it never was my luck to see her like among them, nor, for\r\nthat matter, anywhere else. I’ve seen a great deal of the world, not only\r\nin people’s kitchens and back-yards but at the street-corners, and on the\r\nwharves, and in other places where my business calls me; and I’m free to\r\nsay, Miss Hepzibah, that I never knew a human creature do her work so much like\r\none of God’s angels as this child Phœbe does!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUncle Venner’s eulogium, if it appear rather too high-strained for the\r\nperson and occasion, had, nevertheless, a sense in which it was both subtile\r\nand true. There was a spiritual quality in Phœbe’s activity. The life of\r\nthe long and busy day—spent in occupations that might so easily have\r\ntaken a squalid and ugly aspect—had been made pleasant, and even lovely,\r\nby the spontaneous grace with which these homely duties seemed to bloom out of\r\nher character; so that labor, while she dealt with it, had the easy and\r\nflexible charm of play. Angels do not toil, but let their good works grow out\r\nof them; and so did Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe two relatives—the young maid and the old one—found time before\r\nnightfall, in the intervals of trade, to make rapid advances towards affection\r\nand confidence. A recluse, like Hepzibah, usually displays remarkable\r\nfrankness, and at least temporary affability, on being absolutely cornered, and\r\nbrought to the point of personal intercourse; like the angel whom Jacob\r\nwrestled with, she is ready to bless you when once overcome.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe old gentlewoman took a dreary and proud satisfaction in leading Phœbe from\r\nroom to room of the house, and recounting the traditions with which, as we may\r\nsay, the walls were lugubriously frescoed. She showed the indentations made by\r\nthe lieutenant-governor’s sword-hilt in the door-panels of the apartment\r\nwhere old Colonel Pyncheon, a dead host, had received his affrighted visitors\r\nwith an awful frown. The dusky terror of that frown, Hepzibah observed, was\r\nthought to be lingering ever since in the passageway. She bade Phœbe step into\r\none of the tall chairs, and inspect the ancient map of the Pyncheon territory\r\nat the eastward. In a tract of land on which she laid her finger, there existed\r\na silver mine, the locality of which was precisely pointed out in some\r\nmemoranda of Colonel Pyncheon himself, but only to be made known when the\r\nfamily claim should be recognized by government. Thus it was for the interest\r\nof all New England that the Pyncheons should have justice done them. She told,\r\ntoo, how that there was undoubtedly an immense treasure of English guineas\r\nhidden somewhere about the house, or in the cellar, or possibly in the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you should happen to find it, Phœbe,” said Hepzibah, glancing\r\naside at her with a grim yet kindly smile, “we will tie up the shop-bell\r\nfor good and all!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, dear cousin,” answered Phœbe; “but, in the mean time,\r\nI hear somebody ringing it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the customer was gone, Hepzibah talked rather vaguely, and at great\r\nlength, about a certain Alice Pyncheon, who had been exceedingly beautiful and\r\naccomplished in her lifetime, a hundred years ago. The fragrance of her rich\r\nand delightful character still lingered about the place where she had lived, as\r\na dried rose-bud scents the drawer where it has withered and perished. This\r\nlovely Alice had met with some great and mysterious calamity, and had grown\r\nthin and white, and gradually faded out of the world. But, even now, she was\r\nsupposed to haunt the House of the Seven Gables, and, a great many\r\ntimes,—especially when one of the Pyncheons was to die,—she had\r\nbeen heard playing sadly and beautifully on the harpsichord. One of these\r\ntunes, just as it had sounded from her spiritual touch, had been written down\r\nby an amateur of music; it was so exquisitely mournful that nobody, to this\r\nday, could bear to hear it played, unless when a great sorrow had made them\r\nknow the still profounder sweetness of it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was it the same harpsichord that you showed me?” inquired Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The very same,” said Hepzibah. “It was Alice\r\nPyncheon’s harpsichord. When I was learning music, my father would never\r\nlet me open it. So, as I could only play on my teacher’s instrument, I\r\nhave forgotten all my music long ago.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLeaving these antique themes, the old lady began to talk about the\r\ndaguerreotypist, whom, as he seemed to be a well-meaning and orderly young man,\r\nand in narrow circumstances, she had permitted to take up his residence in one\r\nof the seven gables. But, on seeing more of Mr. Holgrave, she hardly knew what\r\nto make of him. He had the strangest companions imaginable; men with long\r\nbeards, and dressed in linen blouses, and other such new-fangled and\r\nill-fitting garments; reformers, temperance lecturers, and all manner of\r\ncross-looking philanthropists; community-men, and come-outers, as Hepzibah\r\nbelieved, who acknowledged no law, and ate no solid food, but lived on the\r\nscent of other people’s cookery, and turned up their noses at the fare.\r\nAs for the daguerreotypist, she had read a paragraph in a penny paper, the\r\nother day, accusing him of making a speech full of wild and disorganizing\r\nmatter, at a meeting of his banditti-like associates. For her own part, she had\r\nreason to believe that he practised animal magnetism, and, if such things were\r\nin fashion nowadays, should be apt to suspect him of studying the Black Art up\r\nthere in his lonesome chamber.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But, dear cousin,” said Phœbe, “if the young man is so\r\ndangerous, why do you let him stay? If he does nothing worse, he may set the\r\nhouse on fire!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, sometimes,” answered Hepzibah, “I have seriously made\r\nit a question, whether I ought not to send him away. But, with all his\r\noddities, he is a quiet kind of a person, and has such a way of taking hold of\r\none’s mind, that, without exactly liking him (for I don’t know\r\nenough of the young man), I should be sorry to lose sight of him entirely. A\r\nwoman clings to slight acquaintances when she lives so much alone as I\r\ndo.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But if Mr. Holgrave is a lawless person!” remonstrated Phœbe, a\r\npart of whose essence it was to keep within the limits of law.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh!” said Hepzibah carelessly,—for, formal as she was,\r\nstill, in her life’s experience, she had gnashed her teeth against human\r\nlaw,—“I suppose he has a law of his own!”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap06\"></a>VI.<br>\r\nMaule’s Well</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter an early tea, the little country-girl strayed into the garden. The\r\nenclosure had formerly been very extensive, but was now contracted within small\r\ncompass, and hemmed about, partly by high wooden fences, and partly by the\r\noutbuildings of houses that stood on another street. In its centre was a\r\ngrass-plat, surrounding a ruinous little structure, which showed just enough of\r\nits original design to indicate that it had once been a summer-house. A\r\nhop-vine, springing from last year’s root, was beginning to clamber over\r\nit, but would be long in covering the roof with its green mantle. Three of the\r\nseven gables either fronted or looked sideways, with a dark solemnity of\r\naspect, down into the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe black, rich soil had fed itself with the decay of a long period of time;\r\nsuch as fallen leaves, the petals of flowers, and the stalks and seed-vessels\r\nof vagrant and lawless plants, more useful after their death than ever while\r\nflaunting in the sun. The evil of these departed years would naturally have\r\nsprung up again, in such rank weeds (symbolic of the transmitted vices of\r\nsociety) as are always prone to root themselves about human dwellings. Phœbe\r\nsaw, however, that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful\r\nlabor, bestowed daily and systematically on the garden. The white double\r\nrosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the\r\ncommencement of the season; and a pear-tree and three damson-trees, which,\r\nexcept a row of currant-bushes, constituted the only varieties of fruit, bore\r\nmarks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs. There\r\nwere also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers, in no very\r\nflourishing condition, but scrupulously weeded; as if some person, either out\r\nof love or curiosity, had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they\r\nwere capable of attaining. The remainder of the garden presented a\r\nwell-selected assortment of esculent vegetables, in a praiseworthy state of\r\nadvancement. Summer squashes almost in their golden blossom; cucumbers, now\r\nevincing a tendency to spread away from the main stock, and ramble far and\r\nwide; two or three rows of string-beans and as many more that were about to\r\nfestoon themselves on poles; tomatoes, occupying a site so sheltered and sunny\r\nthat the plants were already gigantic, and promised an early and abundant\r\nharvest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe wondered whose care and toil it could have been that had planted these\r\nvegetables, and kept the soil so clean and orderly. Not surely her cousin\r\nHepzibah’s, who had no taste nor spirits for the lady-like employment of\r\ncultivating flowers, and—with her recluse habits, and tendency to shelter\r\nherself within the dismal shadow of the house—would hardly have come\r\nforth under the speck of open sky to weed and hoe among the fraternity of beans\r\nand squashes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt being her first day of complete estrangement from rural objects, Phœbe\r\nfound an unexpected charm in this little nook of grass, and foliage, and\r\naristocratic flowers, and plebeian vegetables. The eye of Heaven seemed to look\r\ndown into it pleasantly, and with a peculiar smile, as if glad to perceive that\r\nnature, elsewhere overwhelmed, and driven out of the dusty town, had here been\r\nable to retain a breathing-place. The spot acquired a somewhat wilder grace,\r\nand yet a very gentle one, from the fact that a pair of robins had built their\r\nnest in the pear-tree, and were making themselves exceedingly busy and happy in\r\nthe dark intricacy of its boughs. Bees, too,—strange to say,—had\r\nthought it worth their while to come hither, possibly from the range of hives\r\nbeside some farm-house miles away. How many aerial voyages might they have\r\nmade, in quest of honey, or honey-laden, betwixt dawn and sunset! Yet, late as\r\nit now was, there still arose a pleasant hum out of one or two of the\r\nsquash-blossoms, in the depths of which these bees were plying their golden\r\nlabor. There was one other object in the garden which Nature might fairly claim\r\nas her inalienable property, in spite of whatever man could do to render it his\r\nown. This was a fountain, set round with a rim of old mossy stones, and paved,\r\nin its bed, with what appeared to be a sort of mosaic-work of variously colored\r\npebbles. The play and slight agitation of the water, in its upward gush,\r\nwrought magically with these variegated pebbles, and made a continually\r\nshifting apparition of quaint figures, vanishing too suddenly to be definable.\r\nThence, swelling over the rim of moss-grown stones, the water stole away under\r\nthe fence, through what we regret to call a gutter, rather than a channel. Nor\r\nmust we forget to mention a hen-coop of very reverend antiquity that stood in\r\nthe farther corner of the garden, not a great way from the fountain. It now\r\ncontained only Chanticleer, his two wives, and a solitary chicken. All of them\r\nwere pure specimens of a breed which had been transmitted down as an heirloom\r\nin the Pyncheon family, and were said, while in their prime, to have attained\r\nalmost the size of turkeys, and, on the score of delicate flesh, to be fit for\r\na prince’s table. In proof of the authenticity of this legendary renown,\r\nHepzibah could have exhibited the shell of a great egg, which an ostrich need\r\nhardly have been ashamed of. Be that as it might, the hens were now scarcely\r\nlarger than pigeons, and had a queer, rusty, withered aspect, and a gouty kind\r\nof movement, and a sleepy and melancholy tone throughout all the variations of\r\ntheir clucking and cackling. It was evident that the race had degenerated, like\r\nmany a noble race besides, in consequence of too strict a watchfulness to keep\r\nit pure. These feathered people had existed too long in their distinct variety;\r\na fact of which the present representatives, judging by their lugubrious\r\ndeportment, seemed to be aware. They kept themselves alive, unquestionably, and\r\nlaid now and then an egg, and hatched a chicken; not for any pleasure of their\r\nown, but that the world might not absolutely lose what had once been so\r\nadmirable a breed of fowls. The distinguishing mark of the hens was a crest of\r\nlamentably scanty growth, in these latter days, but so oddly and wickedly\r\nanalogous to Hepzibah’s turban, that Phœbe—to the poignant\r\ndistress of her conscience, but inevitably—was led to fancy a general\r\nresemblance betwixt these forlorn bipeds and her respectable relative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl ran into the house to get some crumbs of bread, cold potatoes, and\r\nother such scraps as were suitable to the accommodating appetite of fowls.\r\nReturning, she gave a peculiar call, which they seemed to recognize. The\r\nchicken crept through the pales of the coop and ran, with some show of\r\nliveliness, to her feet; while Chanticleer and the ladies of his household\r\nregarded her with queer, sidelong glances, and then croaked one to another, as\r\nif communicating their sage opinions of her character. So wise, as well as\r\nantique, was their aspect, as to give color to the idea, not merely that they\r\nwere the descendants of a time-honored race, but that they had existed, in\r\ntheir individual capacity, ever since the House of the Seven Gables was\r\nfounded, and were somehow mixed up with its destiny. They were a species of\r\ntutelary sprite, or Banshee; although winged and feathered differently from\r\nmost other guardian angels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here, you odd little chicken!” said Phœbe; “here are some\r\nnice crumbs for you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe chicken, hereupon, though almost as venerable in appearance as its\r\nmother—possessing, indeed, the whole antiquity of its progenitors in\r\nminiature,—mustered vivacity enough to flutter upward and alight on\r\nPhœbe’s shoulder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That little fowl pays you a high compliment!” said a voice behind\r\nPhœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTurning quickly, she was surprised at sight of a young man, who had found\r\naccess into the garden by a door opening out of another gable than that whence\r\nshe had emerged. He held a hoe in his hand, and, while Phœbe was gone in quest\r\nof the crumbs, had begun to busy himself with drawing up fresh earth about the\r\nroots of the tomatoes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The chicken really treats you like an old acquaintance,” continued\r\nhe in a quiet way, while a smile made his face pleasanter than Phœbe at first\r\nfancied it. “Those venerable personages in the coop, too, seem very\r\naffably disposed. You are lucky to be in their good graces so soon! They have\r\nknown me much longer, but never honor me with any familiarity, though hardly a\r\nday passes without my bringing them food. Miss Hepzibah, I suppose, will\r\ninterweave the fact with her other traditions, and set it down that the fowls\r\nknow you to be a Pyncheon!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The secret is,” said Phœbe, smiling, “that I have learned\r\nhow to talk with hens and chickens.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, but these hens,” answered the young man,—“these\r\nhens of aristocratic lineage would scorn to understand the vulgar language of a\r\nbarn-yard fowl. I prefer to think—and so would Miss Hepzibah—that\r\nthey recognize the family tone. For you are a Pyncheon?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My name is Phœbe Pyncheon,” said the girl, with a manner of some\r\nreserve; for she was aware that her new acquaintance could be no other than the\r\ndaguerreotypist, of whose lawless propensities the old maid had given her a\r\ndisagreeable idea. “I did not know that my cousin Hepzibah’s garden\r\nwas under another person’s care.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” said Holgrave, “I dig, and hoe, and weed, in this\r\nblack old earth, for the sake of refreshing myself with what little nature and\r\nsimplicity may be left in it, after men have so long sown and reaped here. I\r\nturn up the earth by way of pastime. My sober occupation, so far as I have any,\r\nis with a lighter material. In short, I make pictures out of sunshine; and, not\r\nto be too much dazzled with my own trade, I have prevailed with Miss Hepzibah\r\nto let me lodge in one of these dusky gables. It is like a bandage over\r\none’s eyes, to come into it. But would you like to see a specimen of my\r\nproductions?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A daguerreotype likeness, do you mean?” asked Phœbe with less\r\nreserve; for, in spite of prejudice, her own youthfulness sprang forward to\r\nmeet his. “I don’t much like pictures of that sort,—they are\r\nso hard and stern; besides dodging away from the eye, and trying to escape\r\naltogether. They are conscious of looking very unamiable, I suppose, and\r\ntherefore hate to be seen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you would permit me,” said the artist, looking at Phœbe,\r\n“I should like to try whether the daguerreotype can bring out\r\ndisagreeable traits on a perfectly amiable face. But there certainly is truth\r\nin what you have said. Most of my likenesses do look unamiable; but the very\r\nsufficient reason, I fancy, is, because the originals are so. There is a\r\nwonderful insight in Heaven’s broad and simple sunshine. While we give it\r\ncredit only for depicting the merest surface, it actually brings out the secret\r\ncharacter with a truth that no painter would ever venture upon, even could he\r\ndetect it. There is, at least, no flattery in my humble line of art. Now, here\r\nis a likeness which I have taken over and over again, and still with no better\r\nresult. Yet the original wears, to common eyes, a very different expression. It\r\nwould gratify me to have your judgment on this character.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe exhibited a daguerreotype miniature in a morocco case. Phœbe merely glanced\r\nat it, and gave it back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know the face,” she replied; “for its stern eye has been\r\nfollowing me about all day. It is my Puritan ancestor, who hangs yonder in the\r\nparlor. To be sure, you have found some way of copying the portrait without its\r\nblack velvet cap and gray beard, and have given him a modern coat and satin\r\ncravat, instead of his cloak and band. I don’t think him improved by your\r\nalterations.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You would have seen other differences had you looked a little\r\nlonger,” said Holgrave, laughing, yet apparently much struck. “I\r\ncan assure you that this is a modern face, and one which you will very probably\r\nmeet. Now, the remarkable point is, that the original wears, to the\r\nworld’s eye,—and, for aught I know, to his most intimate\r\nfriends,—an exceedingly pleasant countenance, indicative of benevolence,\r\nopenness of heart, sunny good-humor, and other praiseworthy qualities of that\r\ncast. The sun, as you see, tells quite another story, and will not be coaxed\r\nout of it, after half a dozen patient attempts on my part. Here we have the\r\nman, sly, subtle, hard, imperious, and, withal, cold as ice. Look at that eye!\r\nWould you like to be at its mercy? At that mouth! Could it ever smile? And yet,\r\nif you could only see the benign smile of the original! It is so much the more\r\nunfortunate, as he is a public character of some eminence, and the likeness was\r\nintended to be engraved.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I don’t wish to see it any more,” observed Phœbe,\r\nturning away her eyes. “It is certainly very like the old portrait. But\r\nmy cousin Hepzibah has another picture,—a miniature. If the original is\r\nstill in the world, I think he might defy the sun to make him look stern and\r\nhard.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have seen that picture, then!” exclaimed the artist, with an\r\nexpression of much interest. “I never did, but have a great curiosity to\r\ndo so. And you judge favorably of the face?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There never was a sweeter one,” said Phœbe. “It is almost\r\ntoo soft and gentle for a man’s.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is there nothing wild in the eye?” continued Holgrave, so\r\nearnestly that it embarrassed Phœbe, as did also the quiet freedom with which\r\nhe presumed on their so recent acquaintance. “Is there nothing dark or\r\nsinister anywhere? Could you not conceive the original to have been guilty of a\r\ngreat crime?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is nonsense,” said Phœbe a little impatiently, “for us\r\nto talk about a picture which you have never seen. You mistake it for some\r\nother. A crime, indeed! Since you are a friend of my cousin Hepzibah’s,\r\nyou should ask her to show you the picture.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It will suit my purpose still better to see the original,” replied\r\nthe daguerreotypist coolly. “As to his character, we need not discuss its\r\npoints; they have already been settled by a competent tribunal, or one which\r\ncalled itself competent. But, stay! Do not go yet, if you please! I have a\r\nproposition to make you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe was on the point of retreating, but turned back, with some hesitation;\r\nfor she did not exactly comprehend his manner, although, on better observation,\r\nits feature seemed rather to be lack of ceremony than any approach to offensive\r\nrudeness. There was an odd kind of authority, too, in what he now proceeded to\r\nsay, rather as if the garden were his own than a place to which he was admitted\r\nmerely by Hepzibah’s courtesy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If agreeable to you,” he observed, “it would give me\r\npleasure to turn over these flowers, and those ancient and respectable fowls,\r\nto your care. Coming fresh from country air and occupations, you will soon feel\r\nthe need of some such out-of-door employment. My own sphere does not so much\r\nlie among flowers. You can trim and tend them, therefore, as you please; and I\r\nwill ask only the least trifle of a blossom, now and then, in exchange for all\r\nthe good, honest kitchen vegetables with which I propose to enrich Miss\r\nHepzibah’s table. So we will be fellow-laborers, somewhat on the\r\ncommunity system.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSilently, and rather surprised at her own compliance, Phœbe accordingly betook\r\nherself to weeding a flower-bed, but busied herself still more with cogitations\r\nrespecting this young man, with whom she so unexpectedly found herself on terms\r\napproaching to familiarity. She did not altogether like him. His character\r\nperplexed the little country-girl, as it might a more practised observer; for,\r\nwhile the tone of his conversation had generally been playful, the impression\r\nleft on her mind was that of gravity, and, except as his youth modified it,\r\nalmost sternness. She rebelled, as it were, against a certain magnetic element\r\nin the artist’s nature, which he exercised towards her, possibly without\r\nbeing conscious of it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a little while, the twilight, deepened by the shadows of the fruit-trees\r\nand the surrounding buildings, threw an obscurity over the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There,” said Holgrave, “it is time to give over work! That\r\nlast stroke of the hoe has cut off a beanstalk. Good-night, Miss Phœbe\r\nPyncheon! Any bright day, if you will put one of those rosebuds in your hair,\r\nand come to my rooms in Central Street, I will seize the purest ray of\r\nsunshine, and make a picture of the flower and its wearer.” He retired\r\ntowards his own solitary gable, but turned his head, on reaching the door, and\r\ncalled to Phœbe, with a tone which certainly had laughter in it, yet which\r\nseemed to be more than half in earnest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Be careful not to drink at Maule’s well!” said he.\r\n“Neither drink nor bathe your face in it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Maule’s well!” answered Phœbe. “Is that it with the\r\nrim of mossy stones? I have no thought of drinking there,—but why\r\nnot?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh,” rejoined the daguerreotypist, “because, like an old\r\nlady’s cup of tea, it is water bewitched!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe vanished; and Phœbe, lingering a moment, saw a glimmering light, and then\r\nthe steady beam of a lamp, in a chamber of the gable. On returning into\r\nHepzibah’s apartment of the house, she found the low-studded parlor so\r\ndim and dusky that her eyes could not penetrate the interior. She was\r\nindistinctly aware, however, that the gaunt figure of the old gentlewoman was\r\nsitting in one of the straight-backed chairs, a little withdrawn from the\r\nwindow, the faint gleam of which showed the blanched paleness of her cheek,\r\nturned sideways towards a corner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shall I light a lamp, Cousin Hepzibah?” she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do, if you please, my dear child,” answered Hepzibah. “But\r\nput it on the table in the corner of the passage. My eyes are weak; and I can\r\nseldom bear the lamplight on them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat an instrument is the human voice! How wonderfully responsive to every\r\nemotion of the human soul! In Hepzibah’s tone, at that moment, there was\r\na certain rich depth and moisture, as if the words, commonplace as they were,\r\nhad been steeped in the warmth of her heart. Again, while lighting the lamp in\r\nthe kitchen, Phœbe fancied that her cousin spoke to her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In a moment, cousin!” answered the girl. “These matches just\r\nglimmer, and go out.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, instead of a response from Hepzibah, she seemed to hear the murmur of an\r\nunknown voice. It was strangely indistinct, however, and less like articulate\r\nwords than an unshaped sound, such as would be the utterance of feeling and\r\nsympathy, rather than of the intellect. So vague was it, that its impression or\r\necho in Phœbe’s mind was that of unreality. She concluded that she must\r\nhave mistaken some other sound for that of the human voice; or else that it was\r\naltogether in her fancy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe set the lighted lamp in the passage, and again entered the parlor.\r\nHepzibah’s form, though its sable outline mingled with the dusk, was now\r\nless imperfectly visible. In the remoter parts of the room, however, its walls\r\nbeing so ill adapted to reflect light, there was nearly the same obscurity as\r\nbefore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Cousin,” said Phœbe, “did you speak to me just now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, child!” replied Hepzibah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFewer words than before, but with the same mysterious music in them! Mellow,\r\nmelancholy, yet not mournful, the tone seemed to gush up out of the deep well\r\nof Hepzibah’s heart, all steeped in its profoundest emotion. There was a\r\ntremor in it, too, that—as all strong feeling is electric—partly\r\ncommunicated itself to Phœbe. The girl sat silently for a moment. But soon,\r\nher senses being very acute, she became conscious of an irregular respiration\r\nin an obscure corner of the room. Her physical organization, moreover, being at\r\nonce delicate and healthy, gave her a perception, operating with almost the\r\neffect of a spiritual medium, that somebody was near at hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear cousin,” asked she, overcoming an indefinable reluctance,\r\n“is there not some one in the room with us?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Phœbe, my dear little girl,” said Hepzibah, after a\r\nmoment’s pause, “you were up betimes, and have been busy all day.\r\nPray go to bed; for I am sure you must need rest. I will sit in the parlor\r\nawhile, and collect my thoughts. It has been my custom for more years, child,\r\nthan you have lived!” While thus dismissing her, the maiden lady stept\r\nforward, kissed Phœbe, and pressed her to her heart, which beat against the\r\ngirl’s bosom with a strong, high, and tumultuous swell. How came there to\r\nbe so much love in this desolate old heart, that it could afford to well over\r\nthus abundantly?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Goodnight, cousin,” said Phœbe, strangely affected by\r\nHepzibah’s manner. “If you begin to love me, I am glad!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe retired to her chamber, but did not soon fall asleep, nor then very\r\nprofoundly. At some uncertain period in the depths of night, and, as it were,\r\nthrough the thin veil of a dream, she was conscious of a footstep mounting the\r\nstairs heavily, but not with force and decision. The voice of Hepzibah, with a\r\nhush through it, was going up along with the footsteps; and, again, responsive\r\nto her cousin’s voice, Phœbe heard that strange, vague murmur, which\r\nmight be likened to an indistinct shadow of human utterance.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap07\"></a>VII.<br>\r\nThe Guest</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Phœbe awoke,—which she did with the early twittering of the\r\nconjugal couple of robins in the pear-tree,—she heard movements below\r\nstairs, and, hastening down, found Hepzibah already in the kitchen. She stood\r\nby a window, holding a book in close contiguity to her nose, as if with the\r\nhope of gaining an olfactory acquaintance with its contents, since her\r\nimperfect vision made it not very easy to read them. If any volume could have\r\nmanifested its essential wisdom in the mode suggested, it would certainly have\r\nbeen the one now in Hepzibah’s hand; and the kitchen, in such an event,\r\nwould forthwith have streamed with the fragrance of venison, turkeys, capons,\r\nlarded partridges, puddings, cakes, and Christmas pies, in all manner of\r\nelaborate mixture and concoction. It was a cookery book, full of innumerable\r\nold fashions of English dishes, and illustrated with engravings, which\r\nrepresented the arrangements of the table at such banquets as it might have\r\nbefitted a nobleman to give in the great hall of his castle. And, amid these\r\nrich and potent devices of the culinary art (not one of which, probably, had\r\nbeen tested, within the memory of any man’s grandfather), poor Hepzibah\r\nwas seeking for some nimble little titbit, which, with what skill she had, and\r\nsuch materials as were at hand, she might toss up for breakfast.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSoon, with a deep sigh, she put aside the savory volume, and inquired of Phœbe\r\nwhether old Speckle, as she called one of the hens, had laid an egg the\r\npreceding day. Phœbe ran to see, but returned without the expected treasure in\r\nher hand. At that instant, however, the blast of a fish-dealer’s conch\r\nwas heard, announcing his approach along the street. With energetic raps at the\r\nshop-window, Hepzibah summoned the man in, and made purchase of what he\r\nwarranted as the finest mackerel in his cart, and as fat a one as ever he felt\r\nwith his finger so early in the season. Requesting Phœbe to roast some\r\ncoffee,—which she casually observed was the real Mocha, and so long kept\r\nthat each of the small berries ought to be worth its weight in gold,—the\r\nmaiden lady heaped fuel into the vast receptacle of the ancient fireplace in\r\nsuch quantity as soon to drive the lingering dusk out of the kitchen. The\r\ncountry-girl, willing to give her utmost assistance, proposed to make an Indian\r\ncake, after her mother’s peculiar method, of easy manufacture, and which\r\nshe could vouch for as possessing a richness, and, if rightly prepared, a\r\ndelicacy, unequalled by any other mode of breakfast-cake. Hepzibah gladly\r\nassenting, the kitchen was soon the scene of savory preparation. Perchance,\r\namid their proper element of smoke, which eddied forth from the ill-constructed\r\nchimney, the ghosts of departed cook-maids looked wonderingly on, or peeped\r\ndown the great breadth of the flue, despising the simplicity of the projected\r\nmeal, yet ineffectually pining to thrust their shadowy hands into each inchoate\r\ndish. The half-starved rats, at any rate, stole visibly out of their\r\nhiding-places, and sat on their hind-legs, snuffing the fumy atmosphere, and\r\nwistfully awaiting an opportunity to nibble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah had no natural turn for cookery, and, to say the truth, had fairly\r\nincurred her present meagreness by often choosing to go without her dinner\r\nrather than be attendant on the rotation of the spit, or ebullition of the pot.\r\nHer zeal over the fire, therefore, was quite an heroic test of sentiment. It\r\nwas touching, and positively worthy of tears (if Phœbe, the only spectator,\r\nexcept the rats and ghosts aforesaid, had not been better employed than in\r\nshedding them), to see her rake out a bed of fresh and glowing coals, and\r\nproceed to broil the mackerel. Her usually pale cheeks were all ablaze with\r\nheat and hurry. She watched the fish with as much tender care and minuteness of\r\nattention as if,—we know not how to express it otherwise,—as if her\r\nown heart were on the gridiron, and her immortal happiness were involved in its\r\nbeing done precisely to a turn!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLife, within doors, has few pleasanter prospects than a neatly arranged and\r\nwell-provisioned breakfast-table. We come to it freshly, in the dewy youth of\r\nthe day, and when our spiritual and sensual elements are in better accord than\r\nat a later period; so that the material delights of the morning meal are\r\ncapable of being fully enjoyed, without any very grievous reproaches, whether\r\ngastric or conscientious, for yielding even a trifle overmuch to the animal\r\ndepartment of our nature. The thoughts, too, that run around the ring of\r\nfamiliar guests have a piquancy and mirthfulness, and oftentimes a vivid truth,\r\nwhich more rarely find their way into the elaborate intercourse of dinner.\r\nHepzibah’s small and ancient table, supported on its slender and graceful\r\nlegs, and covered with a cloth of the richest damask, looked worthy to be the\r\nscene and centre of one of the cheerfullest of parties. The vapor of the\r\nbroiled fish arose like incense from the shrine of a barbarian idol, while the\r\nfragrance of the Mocha might have gratified the nostrils of a tutelary Lar, or\r\nwhatever power has scope over a modern breakfast-table. Phœbe’s Indian\r\ncakes were the sweetest offering of all,—in their hue befitting the\r\nrustic altars of the innocent and golden age,—or, so brightly yellow were\r\nthey, resembling some of the bread which was changed to glistening gold when\r\nMidas tried to eat it. The butter must not be forgotten,—butter which\r\nPhœbe herself had churned, in her own rural home, and brought it to her cousin\r\nas a propitiatory gift,—smelling of clover-blossoms, and diffusing the\r\ncharm of pastoral scenery through the dark-panelled parlor. All this, with the\r\nquaint gorgeousness of the old china cups and saucers, and the crested spoons,\r\nand a silver cream-jug (Hepzibah’s only other article of plate, and\r\nshaped like the rudest porringer), set out a board at which the stateliest of\r\nold Colonel Pyncheon’s guests need not have scorned to take his place.\r\nBut the Puritan’s face scowled down out of the picture, as if nothing on\r\nthe table pleased his appetite.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy way of contributing what grace she could, Phœbe gathered some roses and a\r\nfew other flowers, possessing either scent or beauty, and arranged them in a\r\nglass pitcher, which, having long ago lost its handle, was so much the fitter\r\nfor a flower-vase. The early sunshine—as fresh as that which peeped into\r\nEve’s bower while she and Adam sat at breakfast there—came\r\ntwinkling through the branches of the pear-tree, and fell quite across the\r\ntable. All was now ready. There were chairs and plates for three. A chair and\r\nplate for Hepzibah,—the same for Phœbe,—but what other guest did\r\nher cousin look for?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThroughout this preparation there had been a constant tremor in\r\nHepzibah’s frame; an agitation so powerful that Phœbe could see the\r\nquivering of her gaunt shadow, as thrown by the firelight on the kitchen wall,\r\nor by the sunshine on the parlor floor. Its manifestations were so various, and\r\nagreed so little with one another, that the girl knew not what to make of it.\r\nSometimes it seemed an ecstasy of delight and happiness. At such moments,\r\nHepzibah would fling out her arms, and infold Phœbe in them, and kiss her\r\ncheek as tenderly as ever her mother had; she appeared to do so by an\r\ninevitable impulse, and as if her bosom were oppressed with tenderness, of\r\nwhich she must needs pour out a little, in order to gain breathing-room. The\r\nnext moment, without any visible cause for the change, her unwonted joy shrank\r\nback, appalled, as it were, and clothed itself in mourning; or it ran and hid\r\nitself, so to speak, in the dungeon of her heart, where it had long lain\r\nchained, while a cold, spectral sorrow took the place of the imprisoned joy,\r\nthat was afraid to be enfranchised,—a sorrow as black as that was bright.\r\nShe often broke into a little, nervous, hysteric laugh, more touching than any\r\ntears could be; and forthwith, as if to try which was the most touching, a gush\r\nof tears would follow; or perhaps the laughter and tears came both at once, and\r\nsurrounded our poor Hepzibah, in a moral sense, with a kind of pale, dim\r\nrainbow. Towards Phœbe, as we have said, she was affectionate,—far\r\ntenderer than ever before, in their brief acquaintance, except for that one\r\nkiss on the preceding night,—yet with a continually recurring pettishness\r\nand irritability. She would speak sharply to her; then, throwing aside all the\r\nstarched reserve of her ordinary manner, ask pardon, and the next instant renew\r\nthe just-forgiven injury.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last, when their mutual labor was all finished, she took Phœbe’s hand\r\nin her own trembling one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Bear with me, my dear child,” she cried; “for truly my heart\r\nis full to the brim! Bear with me; for I love you, Phœbe, though I speak so\r\nroughly. Think nothing of it, dearest child! By and by, I shall be kind, and\r\nonly kind!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dearest cousin, cannot you tell me what has happened?” asked\r\nPhœbe, with a sunny and tearful sympathy. “What is it that moves you\r\nso?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hush! hush! He is coming!” whispered Hepzibah, hastily wiping her\r\neyes. “Let him see you first, Phœbe; for you are young and rosy, and\r\ncannot help letting a smile break out whether or no. He always liked bright\r\nfaces! And mine is old now, and the tears are hardly dry on it. He never could\r\nabide tears. There; draw the curtain a little, so that the shadow may fall\r\nacross his side of the table! But let there be a good deal of sunshine, too;\r\nfor he never was fond of gloom, as some people are. He has had but little\r\nsunshine in his life,—poor Clifford,—and, oh, what a black shadow.\r\nPoor, poor Clifford!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus murmuring in an undertone, as if speaking rather to her own heart than to\r\nPhœbe, the old gentlewoman stepped on tiptoe about the room, making such\r\narrangements as suggested themselves at the crisis.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile there was a step in the passage-way, above stairs. Phœbe recognized\r\nit as the same which had passed upward, as through her dream, in the\r\nnight-time. The approaching guest, whoever it might be, appeared to pause at\r\nthe head of the staircase; he paused twice or thrice in the descent; he paused\r\nagain at the foot. Each time, the delay seemed to be without purpose, but\r\nrather from a forgetfulness of the purpose which had set him in motion, or as\r\nif the person’s feet came involuntarily to a stand-still because the\r\nmotive-power was too feeble to sustain his progress. Finally, he made a long\r\npause at the threshold of the parlor. He took hold of the knob of the door;\r\nthen loosened his grasp without opening it. Hepzibah, her hands convulsively\r\nclasped, stood gazing at the entrance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Cousin Hepzibah, pray don’t look so!” said Phœbe,\r\ntrembling; for her cousin’s emotion, and this mysteriously reluctant\r\nstep, made her feel as if a ghost were coming into the room. “You really\r\nfrighten me! Is something awful going to happen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hush!” whispered Hepzibah. “Be cheerful! whatever may\r\nhappen, be nothing but cheerful!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe final pause at the threshold proved so long, that Hepzibah, unable to\r\nendure the suspense, rushed forward, threw open the door, and led in the\r\nstranger by the hand. At the first glance, Phœbe saw an elderly personage, in\r\nan old-fashioned dressing-gown of faded damask, and wearing his gray or almost\r\nwhite hair of an unusual length. It quite overshadowed his forehead, except\r\nwhen he thrust it back, and stared vaguely about the room. After a very brief\r\ninspection of his face, it was easy to conceive that his footstep must\r\nnecessarily be such an one as that which, slowly and with as indefinite an aim\r\nas a child’s first journey across a floor, had just brought him\r\nhitherward. Yet there were no tokens that his physical strength might not have\r\nsufficed for a free and determined gait. It was the spirit of the man that\r\ncould not walk. The expression of his countenance—while, notwithstanding\r\nit had the light of reason in it—seemed to waver, and glimmer, and nearly\r\nto die away, and feebly to recover itself again. It was like a flame which we\r\nsee twinkling among half-extinguished embers; we gaze at it more intently than\r\nif it were a positive blaze, gushing vividly upward,—more intently, but\r\nwith a certain impatience, as if it ought either to kindle itself into\r\nsatisfactory splendor, or be at once extinguished.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor an instant after entering the room, the guest stood still, retaining\r\nHepzibah’s hand instinctively, as a child does that of the grown person\r\nwho guides it. He saw Phœbe, however, and caught an illumination from her\r\nyouthful and pleasant aspect, which, indeed, threw a cheerfulness about the\r\nparlor, like the circle of reflected brilliancy around the glass vase of\r\nflowers that was standing in the sunshine. He made a salutation, or, to speak\r\nnearer the truth, an ill-defined, abortive attempt at curtsy. Imperfect as it\r\nwas, however, it conveyed an idea, or, at least, gave a hint, of indescribable\r\ngrace, such as no practised art of external manners could have attained. It was\r\ntoo slight to seize upon at the instant; yet, as recollected afterwards, seemed\r\nto transfigure the whole man.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Clifford,” said Hepzibah, in the tone with which one soothes\r\na wayward infant, “this is our cousin Phœbe,—little Phœbe\r\nPyncheon,—Arthur’s only child, you know. She has come from the\r\ncountry to stay with us awhile; for our old house has grown to be very lonely\r\nnow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Phœbe—Phœbe Pyncheon?—Phœbe?” repeated the guest,\r\nwith a strange, sluggish, ill-defined utterance. “Arthur’s child!\r\nAh, I forget! No matter. She is very welcome!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, dear Clifford, take this chair,” said Hepzibah, leading him\r\nto his place. “Pray, Phœbe, lower the curtain a very little more. Now\r\nlet us begin breakfast.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe guest seated himself in the place assigned him, and looked strangely\r\naround. He was evidently trying to grapple with the present scene, and bring it\r\nhome to his mind with a more satisfactory distinctness. He desired to be\r\ncertain, at least, that he was here, in the low-studded, cross-beamed,\r\noaken-panelled parlor, and not in some other spot, which had stereotyped itself\r\ninto his senses. But the effort was too great to be sustained with more than a\r\nfragmentary success. Continually, as we may express it, he faded away out of\r\nhis place; or, in other words, his mind and consciousness took their departure,\r\nleaving his wasted, gray, and melancholy figure—a substantial emptiness,\r\na material ghost—to occupy his seat at table. Again, after a blank\r\nmoment, there would be a flickering taper-gleam in his eyeballs. It betokened\r\nthat his spiritual part had returned, and was doing its best to kindle the\r\nheart’s household fire, and light up intellectual lamps in the dark and\r\nruinous mansion, where it was doomed to be a forlorn inhabitant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt one of these moments of less torpid, yet still imperfect animation, Phœbe\r\nbecame convinced of what she had at first rejected as too extravagant and\r\nstartling an idea. She saw that the person before her must have been the\r\noriginal of the beautiful miniature in her cousin Hepzibah’s possession.\r\nIndeed, with a feminine eye for costume, she had at once identified the damask\r\ndressing-gown, which enveloped him, as the same in figure, material, and\r\nfashion, with that so elaborately represented in the picture. This old, faded\r\ngarment, with all its pristine brilliancy extinct, seemed, in some\r\nindescribable way, to translate the wearer’s untold misfortune, and make\r\nit perceptible to the beholder’s eye. It was the better to be discerned,\r\nby this exterior type, how worn and old were the soul’s more immediate\r\ngarments; that form and countenance, the beauty and grace of which had almost\r\ntranscended the skill of the most exquisite of artists. It could the more\r\nadequately be known that the soul of the man must have suffered some miserable\r\nwrong, from its earthly experience. There he seemed to sit, with a dim veil of\r\ndecay and ruin betwixt him and the world, but through which, at flitting\r\nintervals, might be caught the same expression, so refined, so softly\r\nimaginative, which Malbone—venturing a happy touch, with suspended\r\nbreath—had imparted to the miniature! There had been something so\r\ninnately characteristic in this look, that all the dusky years, and the burden\r\nof unfit calamity which had fallen upon him, did not suffice utterly to destroy\r\nit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah had now poured out a cup of deliciously fragrant coffee, and presented\r\nit to her guest. As his eyes met hers, he seemed bewildered and disquieted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is this you, Hepzibah?” he murmured sadly; then, more apart, and\r\nperhaps unconscious that he was overheard, “How changed! how changed! And\r\nis she angry with me? Why does she bend her brow so?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Hepzibah! It was that wretched scowl which time and her near-sightedness,\r\nand the fret of inward discomfort, had rendered so habitual that any vehemence\r\nof mood invariably evoked it. But at the indistinct murmur of his words her\r\nwhole face grew tender, and even lovely, with sorrowful affection; the\r\nharshness of her features disappeared, as it were, behind the warm and misty\r\nglow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Angry!” she repeated; “angry with you, Clifford!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer tone, as she uttered the exclamation, had a plaintive and really exquisite\r\nmelody thrilling through it, yet without subduing a certain something which an\r\nobtuse auditor might still have mistaken for asperity. It was as if some\r\ntranscendent musician should draw a soul-thrilling sweetness out of a cracked\r\ninstrument, which makes its physical imperfection heard in the midst of\r\nethereal harmony,—so deep was the sensibility that found an organ in\r\nHepzibah’s voice!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is nothing but love here, Clifford,” she\r\nadded,—“nothing but love! You are at home!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe guest responded to her tone by a smile, which did not half light up his\r\nface. Feeble as it was, however, and gone in a moment, it had a charm of\r\nwonderful beauty. It was followed by a coarser expression; or one that had the\r\neffect of coarseness on the fine mould and outline of his countenance, because\r\nthere was nothing intellectual to temper it. It was a look of appetite. He ate\r\nfood with what might almost be termed voracity; and seemed to forget himself,\r\nHepzibah, the young girl, and everything else around him, in the sensual\r\nenjoyment which the bountifully spread table afforded. In his natural system,\r\nthough high-wrought and delicately refined, a sensibility to the delights of\r\nthe palate was probably inherent. It would have been kept in check, however,\r\nand even converted into an accomplishment, and one of the thousand modes of\r\nintellectual culture, had his more ethereal characteristics retained their\r\nvigor. But as it existed now, the effect was painful and made Phœbe droop her\r\neyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn a little while the guest became sensible of the fragrance of the yet\r\nuntasted coffee. He quaffed it eagerly. The subtle essence acted on him like a\r\ncharmed draught, and caused the opaque substance of his animal being to grow\r\ntransparent, or, at least, translucent; so that a spiritual gleam was\r\ntransmitted through it, with a clearer lustre than hitherto.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“More, more!” he cried, with nervous haste in his utterance, as if\r\nanxious to retain his grasp of what sought to escape him. “This is what I\r\nneed! Give me more!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUnder this delicate and powerful influence he sat more erect, and looked out\r\nfrom his eyes with a glance that took note of what it rested on. It was not so\r\nmuch that his expression grew more intellectual; this, though it had its share,\r\nwas not the most peculiar effect. Neither was what we call the moral nature so\r\nforcibly awakened as to present itself in remarkable prominence. But a certain\r\nfine temper of being was now not brought out in full relief, but changeably and\r\nimperfectly betrayed, of which it was the function to deal with all beautiful\r\nand enjoyable things. In a character where it should exist as the chief\r\nattribute, it would bestow on its possessor an exquisite taste, and an enviable\r\nsusceptibility of happiness. Beauty would be his life; his aspirations would\r\nall tend toward it; and, allowing his frame and physical organs to be in\r\nconsonance, his own developments would likewise be beautiful. Such a man should\r\nhave nothing to do with sorrow; nothing with strife; nothing with the martyrdom\r\nwhich, in an infinite variety of shapes, awaits those who have the heart, and\r\nwill, and conscience, to fight a battle with the world. To these heroic\r\ntempers, such martyrdom is the richest meed in the world’s gift. To the\r\nindividual before us, it could only be a grief, intense in due proportion with\r\nthe severity of the infliction. He had no right to be a martyr; and, beholding\r\nhim so fit to be happy and so feeble for all other purposes, a generous,\r\nstrong, and noble spirit would, methinks, have been ready to sacrifice what\r\nlittle enjoyment it might have planned for itself,—it would have flung\r\ndown the hopes, so paltry in its regard,—if thereby the wintry blasts of\r\nour rude sphere might come tempered to such a man.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNot to speak it harshly or scornfully, it seemed Clifford’s nature to be\r\na Sybarite. It was perceptible, even there, in the dark old parlor, in the\r\ninevitable polarity with which his eyes were attracted towards the quivering\r\nplay of sunbeams through the shadowy foliage. It was seen in his appreciating\r\nnotice of the vase of flowers, the scent of which he inhaled with a zest almost\r\npeculiar to a physical organization so refined that spiritual ingredients are\r\nmoulded in with it. It was betrayed in the unconscious smile with which he\r\nregarded Phœbe, whose fresh and maidenly figure was both sunshine and\r\nflowers,—their essence, in a prettier and more agreeable mode of\r\nmanifestation. Not less evident was this love and necessity for the Beautiful,\r\nin the instinctive caution with which, even so soon, his eyes turned away from\r\nhis hostess, and wandered to any quarter rather than come back. It was\r\nHepzibah’s misfortune,—not Clifford’s fault. How could\r\nhe,—so yellow as she was, so wrinkled, so sad of mien, with that odd\r\nuncouthness of a turban on her head, and that most perverse of scowls\r\ncontorting her brow,—how could he love to gaze at her? But, did he owe\r\nher no affection for so much as she had silently given? He owed her nothing. A\r\nnature like Clifford’s can contract no debts of that kind. It is—we\r\nsay it without censure, nor in diminution of the claim which it indefeasibly\r\npossesses on beings of another mould—it is always selfish in its essence;\r\nand we must give it leave to be so, and heap up our heroic and disinterested\r\nlove upon it so much the more, without a recompense. Poor Hepzibah knew this\r\ntruth, or, at least, acted on the instinct of it. So long estranged from what\r\nwas lovely as Clifford had been, she rejoiced—rejoiced, though with a\r\npresent sigh, and a secret purpose to shed tears in her own chamber that he had\r\nbrighter objects now before his eyes than her aged and uncomely features. They\r\nnever possessed a charm; and if they had, the canker of her grief for him would\r\nlong since have destroyed it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe guest leaned back in his chair. Mingled in his countenance with a dreamy\r\ndelight, there was a troubled look of effort and unrest. He was seeking to make\r\nhimself more fully sensible of the scene around him; or, perhaps, dreading it\r\nto be a dream, or a play of imagination, was vexing the fair moment with a\r\nstruggle for some added brilliancy and more durable illusion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How pleasant!—How delightful!” he murmured, but not as if\r\naddressing any one. “Will it last? How balmy the atmosphere through that\r\nopen window! An open window! How beautiful that play of sunshine! Those\r\nflowers, how very fragrant! That young girl’s face, how cheerful, how\r\nblooming!—a flower with the dew on it, and sunbeams in the dew-drops! Ah!\r\nthis must be all a dream! A dream! A dream! But it has quite hidden the four\r\nstone walls!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen his face darkened, as if the shadow of a cavern or a dungeon had come over\r\nit; there was no more light in its expression than might have come through the\r\niron grates of a prison-window—still lessening, too, as if he were\r\nsinking farther into the depths. Phœbe (being of that quickness and activity\r\nof temperament that she seldom long refrained from taking a part, and generally\r\na good one, in what was going forward) now felt herself moved to address the\r\nstranger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here is a new kind of rose, which I found this morning in the\r\ngarden,” said she, choosing a small crimson one from among the flowers in\r\nthe vase. “There will be but five or six on the bush this season. This is\r\nthe most perfect of them all; not a speck of blight or mildew in it. And how\r\nsweet it is!—sweet like no other rose! One can never forget that\r\nscent!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah!—let me see!—let me hold it!” cried the guest,\r\neagerly seizing the flower, which, by the spell peculiar to remembered odors,\r\nbrought innumerable associations along with the fragrance that it exhaled.\r\n“Thank you! This has done me good. I remember how I used to prize this\r\nflower,—long ago, I suppose, very long ago!—or was it only\r\nyesterday? It makes me feel young again! Am I young? Either this remembrance is\r\nsingularly distinct, or this consciousness strangely dim! But how kind of the\r\nfair young girl! Thank you! Thank you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe favorable excitement derived from this little crimson rose afforded\r\nClifford the brightest moment which he enjoyed at the breakfast-table. It might\r\nhave lasted longer, but that his eyes happened, soon afterwards, to rest on the\r\nface of the old Puritan, who, out of his dingy frame and lustreless canvas, was\r\nlooking down on the scene like a ghost, and a most ill-tempered and ungenial\r\none. The guest made an impatient gesture of the hand, and addressed Hepzibah\r\nwith what might easily be recognized as the licensed irritability of a petted\r\nmember of the family.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hepzibah!—Hepzibah!” cried he with no little force and\r\ndistinctness, “why do you keep that odious picture on the wall? Yes,\r\nyes!—that is precisely your taste! I have told you, a thousand times,\r\nthat it was the evil genius of the house!—my evil genius particularly!\r\nTake it down, at once!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Clifford,” said Hepzibah sadly, “you know it cannot\r\nbe!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then, at all events,” continued he, still speaking with some\r\nenergy, “pray cover it with a crimson curtain, broad enough to hang in\r\nfolds, and with a golden border and tassels. I cannot bear it! It must not\r\nstare me in the face!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, dear Clifford, the picture shall be covered,” said Hepzibah\r\nsoothingly. “There is a crimson curtain in a trunk above stairs,—a\r\nlittle faded and moth-eaten, I’m afraid,—but Phœbe and I will do\r\nwonders with it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This very day, remember” said he; and then added, in a low,\r\nself-communing voice, “Why should we live in this dismal house at all?\r\nWhy not go to the South of France?—to Italy?—Paris, Naples, Venice,\r\nRome? Hepzibah will say we have not the means. A droll idea that!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe smiled to himself, and threw a glance of fine sarcastic meaning towards\r\nHepzibah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the several moods of feeling, faintly as they were marked, through which he\r\nhad passed, occurring in so brief an interval of time, had evidently wearied\r\nthe stranger. He was probably accustomed to a sad monotony of life, not so much\r\nflowing in a stream, however sluggish, as stagnating in a pool around his feet.\r\nA slumberous veil diffused itself over his countenance, and had an effect,\r\nmorally speaking, on its naturally delicate and elegant outline, like that\r\nwhich a brooding mist, with no sunshine in it, throws over the features of a\r\nlandscape. He appeared to become grosser,—almost cloddish. If aught of\r\ninterest or beauty—even ruined beauty—had heretofore been visible\r\nin this man, the beholder might now begin to doubt it, and to accuse his own\r\nimagination of deluding him with whatever grace had flickered over that visage,\r\nand whatever exquisite lustre had gleamed in those filmy eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore he had quite sunken away, however, the sharp and peevish tinkle of the\r\nshop-bell made itself audible. Striking most disagreeably on Clifford’s\r\nauditory organs and the characteristic sensibility of his nerves, it caused him\r\nto start upright out of his chair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good heavens, Hepzibah! what horrible disturbance have we now in the\r\nhouse?” cried he, wreaking his resentful impatience—as a matter of\r\ncourse, and a custom of old—on the one person in the world that loved\r\nhim. “I have never heard such a hateful clamor! Why do you permit it? In\r\nthe name of all dissonance, what can it be?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was very remarkable into what prominent relief—even as if a dim\r\npicture should leap suddenly from its canvas—Clifford’s character\r\nwas thrown by this apparently trifling annoyance. The secret was, that an\r\nindividual of his temper can always be pricked more acutely through his sense\r\nof the beautiful and harmonious than through his heart. It is even\r\npossible—for similar cases have often happened—that if Clifford, in\r\nhis foregoing life, had enjoyed the means of cultivating his taste to its\r\nutmost perfectibility, that subtile attribute might, before this period, have\r\ncompletely eaten out or filed away his affections. Shall we venture to\r\npronounce, therefore, that his long and black calamity may not have had a\r\nredeeming drop of mercy at the bottom?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Clifford, I wish I could keep the sound from your ears,” said\r\nHepzibah, patiently, but reddening with a painful suffusion of shame. “It\r\nis very disagreeable even to me. But, do you know, Clifford, I have something\r\nto tell you? This ugly noise,—pray run, Phœbe, and see who is\r\nthere!—this naughty little tinkle is nothing but our shop-bell!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shop-bell!” repeated Clifford, with a bewildered stare.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, our shop-bell,” said Hepzibah, a certain natural dignity,\r\nmingled with deep emotion, now asserting itself in her manner. “For you\r\nmust know, dearest Clifford, that we are very poor. And there was no other\r\nresource, but either to accept assistance from a hand that I would push aside\r\n(and so would you!) were it to offer bread when we were dying for it,—no\r\nhelp, save from him, or else to earn our subsistence with my own hands! Alone,\r\nI might have been content to starve. But you were to be given back to me! Do\r\nyou think, then, dear Clifford,” added she, with a wretched smile,\r\n“that I have brought an irretrievable disgrace on the old house, by\r\nopening a little shop in the front gable? Our great-great-grandfather did the\r\nsame, when there was far less need! Are you ashamed of me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shame! Disgrace! Do you speak these words to me, Hepzibah?” said\r\nClifford,—not angrily, however; for when a man’s spirit has been\r\nthoroughly crushed, he may be peevish at small offences, but never resentful of\r\ngreat ones. So he spoke with only a grieved emotion. “It was not kind to\r\nsay so, Hepzibah! What shame can befall me now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then the unnerved man—he that had been born for enjoyment, but had\r\nmet a doom so very wretched—burst into a woman’s passion of tears.\r\nIt was but of brief continuance, however; soon leaving him in a quiescent, and,\r\nto judge by his countenance, not an uncomfortable state. From this mood, too,\r\nhe partially rallied for an instant, and looked at Hepzibah with a smile, the\r\nkeen, half-derisory purport of which was a puzzle to her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are we so very poor, Hepzibah?” said he.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, his chair being deep and softly cushioned, Clifford fell asleep.\r\nHearing the more regular rise and fall of his breath (which, however, even\r\nthen, instead of being strong and full, had a feeble kind of tremor,\r\ncorresponding with the lack of vigor in his character),—hearing these\r\ntokens of settled slumber, Hepzibah seized the opportunity to peruse his face\r\nmore attentively than she had yet dared to do. Her heart melted away in tears;\r\nher profoundest spirit sent forth a moaning voice, low, gentle, but\r\ninexpressibly sad. In this depth of grief and pity she felt that there was no\r\nirreverence in gazing at his altered, aged, faded, ruined face. But no sooner\r\nwas she a little relieved than her conscience smote her for gazing curiously at\r\nhim, now that he was so changed; and, turning hastily away, Hepzibah let down\r\nthe curtain over the sunny window, and left Clifford to slumber there.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap08\"></a>VIII.<br>\r\nThe Pyncheon of To-day</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe, on entering the shop, beheld there the already familiar face of the\r\nlittle devourer—if we can reckon his mighty deeds aright—of Jim\r\nCrow, the elephant, the camel, the dromedaries, and the locomotive. Having\r\nexpended his private fortune, on the two preceding days, in the purchase of the\r\nabove unheard-of luxuries, the young gentleman’s present errand was on\r\nthe part of his mother, in quest of three eggs and half a pound of raisins.\r\nThese articles Phœbe accordingly supplied, and, as a mark of gratitude for his\r\nprevious patronage, and a slight super-added morsel after breakfast, put\r\nlikewise into his hand a whale! The great fish, reversing his experience with\r\nthe prophet of Nineveh, immediately began his progress down the same red\r\npathway of fate whither so varied a caravan had preceded him. This remarkable\r\nurchin, in truth, was the very emblem of old Father Time, both in respect of\r\nhis all-devouring appetite for men and things, and because he, as well as Time,\r\nafter ingulfing thus much of creation, looked almost as youthful as if he had\r\nbeen just that moment made.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter partly closing the door, the child turned back, and mumbled something to\r\nPhœbe, which, as the whale was but half disposed of, she could not perfectly\r\nunderstand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What did you say, my little fellow?” asked she.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mother wants to know” repeated Ned Higgins more distinctly,\r\n“how Old Maid Pyncheon’s brother does? Folks say he has got\r\nhome.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My cousin Hepzibah’s brother?” exclaimed Phœbe, surprised\r\nat this sudden explanation of the relationship between Hepzibah and her guest.\r\n“Her brother! And where can he have been?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe little boy only put his thumb to his broad snub-nose, with that look of\r\nshrewdness which a child, spending much of his time in the street, so soon\r\nlearns to throw over his features, however unintelligent in themselves. Then as\r\nPhœbe continued to gaze at him, without answering his mother’s message,\r\nhe took his departure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the child went down the steps, a gentleman ascended them, and made his\r\nentrance into the shop. It was the portly, and, had it possessed the advantage\r\nof a little more height, would have been the stately figure of a man\r\nconsiderably in the decline of life, dressed in a black suit of some thin\r\nstuff, resembling broadcloth as closely as possible. A gold-headed cane, of\r\nrare Oriental wood, added materially to the high respectability of his aspect,\r\nas did also a neckcloth of the utmost snowy purity, and the conscientious\r\npolish of his boots. His dark, square countenance, with its almost shaggy depth\r\nof eyebrows, was naturally impressive, and would, perhaps, have been rather\r\nstern, had not the gentleman considerately taken upon himself to mitigate the\r\nharsh effect by a look of exceeding good-humor and benevolence. Owing, however,\r\nto a somewhat massive accumulation of animal substance about the lower region\r\nof his face, the look was, perhaps, unctuous rather than spiritual, and had, so\r\nto speak, a kind of fleshly effulgence, not altogether so satisfactory as he\r\ndoubtless intended it to be. A susceptible observer, at any rate, might have\r\nregarded it as affording very little evidence of the general benignity of soul\r\nwhereof it purported to be the outward reflection. And if the observer chanced\r\nto be ill-natured, as well as acute and susceptible, he would probably suspect\r\nthat the smile on the gentleman’s face was a good deal akin to the shine\r\non his boots, and that each must have cost him and his boot-black,\r\nrespectively, a good deal of hard labor to bring out and preserve them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the stranger entered the little shop, where the projection of the second\r\nstory and the thick foliage of the elm-tree, as well as the commodities at the\r\nwindow, created a sort of gray medium, his smile grew as intense as if he had\r\nset his heart on counteracting the whole gloom of the atmosphere (besides any\r\nmoral gloom pertaining to Hepzibah and her inmates) by the unassisted light of\r\nhis countenance. On perceiving a young rose-bud of a girl, instead of the gaunt\r\npresence of the old maid, a look of surprise was manifest. He at first knit his\r\nbrows; then smiled with more unctuous benignity than ever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, I see how it is!” said he in a deep voice,—a voice\r\nwhich, had it come from the throat of an uncultivated man, would have been\r\ngruff, but, by dint of careful training, was now sufficiently\r\nagreeable,—“I was not aware that Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon had\r\ncommenced business under such favorable auspices. You are her assistant, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I certainly am,” answered Phœbe, and added, with a little air of\r\nlady-like assumption (for, civil as the gentleman was, he evidently took her to\r\nbe a young person serving for wages), “I am a cousin of Miss Hepzibah, on\r\na visit to her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Her cousin?—and from the country? Pray pardon me, then,”\r\nsaid the gentleman, bowing and smiling, as Phœbe never had been bowed to nor\r\nsmiled on before; “in that case, we must be better acquainted; for,\r\nunless I am sadly mistaken, you are my own little kinswoman likewise! Let me\r\nsee,—Mary?—Dolly?—Phœbe?—yes, Phœbe is the name! Is\r\nit possible that you are Phœbe Pyncheon, only child of my dear cousin and\r\nclassmate, Arthur? Ah, I see your father now, about your mouth! Yes, yes! we\r\nmust be better acquainted! I am your kinsman, my dear. Surely you must have\r\nheard of Judge Pyncheon?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs Phœbe curtsied in reply, the Judge bent forward, with the pardonable and\r\neven praiseworthy purpose—considering the nearness of blood and the\r\ndifference of age—of bestowing on his young relative a kiss of\r\nacknowledged kindred and natural affection. Unfortunately (without design, or\r\nonly with such instinctive design as gives no account of itself to the\r\nintellect) Phœbe, just at the critical moment, drew back; so that her highly\r\nrespectable kinsman, with his body bent over the counter and his lips\r\nprotruded, was betrayed into the rather absurd predicament of kissing the empty\r\nair. It was a modern parallel to the case of Ixion embracing a cloud, and was\r\nso much the more ridiculous as the Judge prided himself on eschewing all airy\r\nmatter, and never mistaking a shadow for a substance. The truth was,—and\r\nit is Phœbe’s only excuse,—that, although Judge Pyncheon’s\r\nglowing benignity might not be absolutely unpleasant to the feminine beholder,\r\nwith the width of a street, or even an ordinary-sized room, interposed between,\r\nyet it became quite too intense, when this dark, full-fed physiognomy (so\r\nroughly bearded, too, that no razor could ever make it smooth) sought to bring\r\nitself into actual contact with the object of its regards. The man, the sex,\r\nsomehow or other, was entirely too prominent in the Judge’s\r\ndemonstrations of that sort. Phœbe’s eyes sank, and, without knowing\r\nwhy, she felt herself blushing deeply under his look. Yet she had been kissed\r\nbefore, and without any particular squeamishness, by perhaps half a dozen\r\ndifferent cousins, younger as well as older than this dark-browned,\r\ngrisly-bearded, white-neck-clothed, and unctuously-benevolent Judge! Then, why\r\nnot by him?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn raising her eyes, Phœbe was startled by the change in Judge\r\nPyncheon’s face. It was quite as striking, allowing for the difference of\r\nscale, as that betwixt a landscape under a broad sunshine and just before a\r\nthunder-storm; not that it had the passionate intensity of the latter aspect,\r\nbut was cold, hard, immitigable, like a day-long brooding cloud.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear me! what is to be done now?” thought the country-girl to\r\nherself. “He looks as if there were nothing softer in him than a rock,\r\nnor milder than the east wind! I meant no harm! Since he is really my cousin, I\r\nwould have let him kiss me, if I could!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen, all at once, it struck Phœbe that this very Judge Pyncheon was the\r\noriginal of the miniature which the daguerreotypist had shown her in the\r\ngarden, and that the hard, stern, relentless look, now on his face, was the\r\nsame that the sun had so inflexibly persisted in bringing out. Was it,\r\ntherefore, no momentary mood, but, however skilfully concealed, the settled\r\ntemper of his life? And not merely so, but was it hereditary in him, and\r\ntransmitted down, as a precious heirloom, from that bearded ancestor, in whose\r\npicture both the expression and, to a singular degree, the features of the\r\nmodern Judge were shown as by a kind of prophecy? A deeper philosopher than\r\nPhœbe might have found something very terrible in this idea. It implied that\r\nthe weaknesses and defects, the bad passions, the mean tendencies, and the\r\nmoral diseases which lead to crime are handed down from one generation to\r\nanother, by a far surer process of transmission than human law has been able to\r\nestablish in respect to the riches and honors which it seeks to entail upon\r\nposterity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, as it happened, scarcely had Phœbe’s eyes rested again on the\r\nJudge’s countenance than all its ugly sternness vanished; and she found\r\nherself quite overpowered by the sultry, dog-day heat, as it were, of\r\nbenevolence, which this excellent man diffused out of his great heart into the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere,—very much like a serpent, which, as a preliminary\r\nto fascination, is said to fill the air with his peculiar odor.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I like that, Cousin Phœbe!” cried he, with an emphatic nod of\r\napprobation. “I like it much, my little cousin! You are a good child, and\r\nknow how to take care of yourself. A young girl—especially if she be a\r\nvery pretty one—can never be too chary of her lips.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Indeed, sir,” said Phœbe, trying to laugh the matter off,\r\n“I did not mean to be unkind.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, whether or no it were entirely owing to the inauspicious\r\ncommencement of their acquaintance, she still acted under a certain reserve,\r\nwhich was by no means customary to her frank and genial nature. The fantasy\r\nwould not quit her, that the original Puritan, of whom she had heard so many\r\nsombre traditions,—the progenitor of the whole race of New England\r\nPyncheons, the founder of the House of the Seven Gables, and who had died so\r\nstrangely in it,—had now stept into the shop. In these days of off-hand\r\nequipment, the matter was easily enough arranged. On his arrival from the other\r\nworld, he had merely found it necessary to spend a quarter of an hour at a\r\nbarber’s, who had trimmed down the Puritan’s full beard into a pair\r\nof grizzled whiskers, then, patronizing a ready-made clothing establishment, he\r\nhad exchanged his velvet doublet and sable cloak, with the richly worked band\r\nunder his chin, for a white collar and cravat, coat, vest, and pantaloons; and\r\nlastly, putting aside his steel-hilted broadsword to take up a gold-headed\r\ncane, the Colonel Pyncheon of two centuries ago steps forward as the Judge of\r\nthe passing moment!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, Phœbe was far too sensible a girl to entertain this idea in any\r\nother way than as matter for a smile. Possibly, also, could the two personages\r\nhave stood together before her eye, many points of difference would have been\r\nperceptible, and perhaps only a general resemblance. The long lapse of\r\nintervening years, in a climate so unlike that which had fostered the ancestral\r\nEnglishman, must inevitably have wrought important changes in the physical\r\nsystem of his descendant. The Judge’s volume of muscle could hardly be\r\nthe same as the Colonel’s; there was undoubtedly less beef in him. Though\r\nlooked upon as a weighty man among his contemporaries in respect of animal\r\nsubstance, and as favored with a remarkable degree of fundamental development,\r\nwell adapting him for the judicial bench, we conceive that the modern Judge\r\nPyncheon, if weighed in the same balance with his ancestor, would have required\r\nat least an old-fashioned fifty-six to keep the scale in equilibrio. Then the\r\nJudge’s face had lost the ruddy English hue that showed its warmth\r\nthrough all the duskiness of the Colonel’s weather-beaten cheek, and had\r\ntaken a sallow shade, the established complexion of his countrymen. If we\r\nmistake not, moreover, a certain quality of nervousness had become more or less\r\nmanifest, even in so solid a specimen of Puritan descent as the gentleman now\r\nunder discussion. As one of its effects, it bestowed on his countenance a\r\nquicker mobility than the old Englishman’s had possessed, and keener\r\nvivacity, but at the expense of a sturdier something, on which these acute\r\nendowments seemed to act like dissolving acids. This process, for aught we\r\nknow, may belong to the great system of human progress, which, with every\r\nascending footstep, as it diminishes the necessity for animal force, may be\r\ndestined gradually to spiritualize us, by refining away our grosser attributes\r\nof body. If so, Judge Pyncheon could endure a century or two more of such\r\nrefinement as well as most other men.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe similarity, intellectual and moral, between the Judge and his ancestor\r\nappears to have been at least as strong as the resemblance of mien and feature\r\nwould afford reason to anticipate. In old Colonel Pyncheon’s funeral\r\ndiscourse the clergyman absolutely canonized his deceased parishioner, and\r\nopening, as it were, a vista through the roof of the church, and thence through\r\nthe firmament above, showed him seated, harp in hand, among the crowned\r\nchoristers of the spiritual world. On his tombstone, too, the record is highly\r\neulogistic; nor does history, so far as he holds a place upon its page, assail\r\nthe consistency and uprightness of his character. So also, as regards the Judge\r\nPyncheon of to-day, neither clergyman, nor legal critic, nor inscriber of\r\ntombstones, nor historian of general or local politics, would venture a word\r\nagainst this eminent person’s sincerity as a Christian, or respectability\r\nas a man, or integrity as a judge, or courage and faithfulness as the\r\noften-tried representative of his political party. But, besides these cold,\r\nformal, and empty words of the chisel that inscribes, the voice that speaks,\r\nand the pen that writes, for the public eye and for distant time,—and\r\nwhich inevitably lose much of their truth and freedom by the fatal\r\nconsciousness of so doing,—there were traditions about the ancestor, and\r\nprivate diurnal gossip about the Judge, remarkably accordant in their\r\ntestimony. It is often instructive to take the woman’s, the private and\r\ndomestic, view of a public man; nor can anything be more curious than the vast\r\ndiscrepancy between portraits intended for engraving and the pencil-sketches\r\nthat pass from hand to hand behind the original’s back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor example: tradition affirmed that the Puritan had been greedy of wealth; the\r\nJudge, too, with all the show of liberal expenditure, was said to be as\r\nclose-fisted as if his gripe were of iron. The ancestor had clothed himself in\r\na grim assumption of kindliness, a rough heartiness of word and manner, which\r\nmost people took to be the genuine warmth of nature, making its way through the\r\nthick and inflexible hide of a manly character. His descendant, in compliance\r\nwith the requirements of a nicer age, had etherealized this rude benevolence\r\ninto that broad benignity of smile wherewith he shone like a noonday sun along\r\nthe streets, or glowed like a household fire in the drawing-rooms of his\r\nprivate acquaintance. The Puritan—if not belied by some singular stories,\r\nmurmured, even at this day, under the narrator’s breath—had fallen\r\ninto certain transgressions to which men of his great animal development,\r\nwhatever their faith or principles, must continue liable, until they put off\r\nimpurity, along with the gross earthly substance that involves it. We must not\r\nstain our page with any contemporary scandal, to a similar purport, that may\r\nhave been whispered against the Judge. The Puritan, again, an autocrat in his\r\nown household, had worn out three wives, and, merely by the remorseless weight\r\nand hardness of his character in the conjugal relation, had sent them, one\r\nafter another, broken-hearted, to their graves. Here the parallel, in some\r\nsort, fails. The Judge had wedded but a single wife, and lost her in the third\r\nor fourth year of their marriage. There was a fable, however,—for such we\r\nchoose to consider it, though, not impossibly, typical of Judge\r\nPyncheon’s marital deportment,—that the lady got her death-blow in\r\nthe honeymoon, and never smiled again, because her husband compelled her to\r\nserve him with coffee every morning at his bedside, in token of fealty to her\r\nliege-lord and master.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it is too fruitful a subject, this of hereditary resemblances,—the\r\nfrequent recurrence of which, in a direct line, is truly unaccountable, when we\r\nconsider how large an accumulation of ancestry lies behind every man at the\r\ndistance of one or two centuries. We shall only add, therefore, that the\r\nPuritan—so, at least, says chimney-corner tradition, which often\r\npreserves traits of character with marvellous fidelity—was bold,\r\nimperious, relentless, crafty; laying his purposes deep, and following them out\r\nwith an inveteracy of pursuit that knew neither rest nor conscience; trampling\r\non the weak, and, when essential to his ends, doing his utmost to beat down the\r\nstrong. Whether the Judge in any degree resembled him, the further progress of\r\nour narrative may show.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nScarcely any of the items in the above-drawn parallel occurred to Phœbe, whose\r\ncountry birth and residence, in truth, had left her pitifully ignorant of most\r\nof the family traditions, which lingered, like cobwebs and incrustations of\r\nsmoke, about the rooms and chimney-corners of the House of the Seven Gables.\r\nYet there was a circumstance, very trifling in itself, which impressed her with\r\nan odd degree of horror. She had heard of the anathema flung by Maule, the\r\nexecuted wizard, against Colonel Pyncheon and his posterity,—that God\r\nwould give them blood to drink,—and likewise of the popular notion, that\r\nthis miraculous blood might now and then be heard gurgling in their throats.\r\nThe latter scandal—as became a person of sense, and, more especially, a\r\nmember of the Pyncheon family—Phœbe had set down for the absurdity which\r\nit unquestionably was. But ancient superstitions, after being steeped in human\r\nhearts and embodied in human breath, and passing from lip to ear in manifold\r\nrepetition, through a series of generations, become imbued with an effect of\r\nhomely truth. The smoke of the domestic hearth has scented them through and\r\nthrough. By long transmission among household facts, they grow to look like\r\nthem, and have such a familiar way of making themselves at home that their\r\ninfluence is usually greater than we suspect. Thus it happened, that when\r\nPhœbe heard a certain noise in Judge Pyncheon’s throat,—rather\r\nhabitual with him, not altogether voluntary, yet indicative of nothing, unless\r\nit were a slight bronchial complaint, or, as some people hinted, an apoplectic\r\nsymptom,—when the girl heard this queer and awkward ingurgitation (which\r\nthe writer never did hear, and therefore cannot describe), she very foolishly\r\nstarted, and clasped her hands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, it was exceedingly ridiculous in Phœbe to be discomposed by such a\r\ntrifle, and still more unpardonable to show her discomposure to the individual\r\nmost concerned in it. But the incident chimed in so oddly with her previous\r\nfancies about the Colonel and the Judge, that, for the moment, it seemed quite\r\nto mingle their identity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is the matter with you, young woman?” said Judge Pyncheon,\r\ngiving her one of his harsh looks. “Are you afraid of anything?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, nothing, sir—nothing in the world!” answered Phœbe,\r\nwith a little laugh of vexation at herself. “But perhaps you wish to\r\nspeak with my cousin Hepzibah. Shall I call her?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stay a moment, if you please,” said the Judge, again beaming\r\nsunshine out of his face. “You seem to be a little nervous this morning.\r\nThe town air, Cousin Phœbe, does not agree with your good, wholesome country\r\nhabits. Or has anything happened to disturb you?—anything remarkable in\r\nCousin Hepzibah’s family?— An arrival, eh? I thought so! No wonder\r\nyou are out of sorts, my little cousin. To be an inmate with such a guest may\r\nwell startle an innocent young girl!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You quite puzzle me, sir,” replied Phœbe, gazing inquiringly at\r\nthe Judge. “There is no frightful guest in the house, but only a poor,\r\ngentle, childlike man, whom I believe to be Cousin Hepzibah’s brother. I\r\nam afraid (but you, sir, will know better than I) that he is not quite in his\r\nsound senses; but so mild and quiet he seems to be, that a mother might trust\r\nher baby with him; and I think he would play with the baby as if he were only a\r\nfew years older than itself. He startle me!—Oh, no indeed!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I rejoice to hear so favorable and so ingenuous an account of my cousin\r\nClifford,” said the benevolent Judge. “Many years ago, when we were\r\nboys and young men together, I had a great affection for him, and still feel a\r\ntender interest in all his concerns. You say, Cousin Phœbe, he appears to be\r\nweak minded. Heaven grant him at least enough of intellect to repent of his\r\npast sins!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nobody, I fancy,” observed Phœbe, “can have fewer to repent\r\nof.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And is it possible, my dear,” rejoined the Judge, with a\r\ncommiserating look, “that you have never heard of Clifford\r\nPyncheon?—that you know nothing of his history? Well, it is all right;\r\nand your mother has shown a very proper regard for the good name of the family\r\nwith which she connected herself. Believe the best you can of this unfortunate\r\nperson, and hope the best! It is a rule which Christians should always follow,\r\nin their judgments of one another; and especially is it right and wise among\r\nnear relatives, whose characters have necessarily a degree of mutual\r\ndependence. But is Clifford in the parlor? I will just step in and see.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Perhaps, sir, I had better call my cousin Hepzibah,” said Phœbe;\r\nhardly knowing, however, whether she ought to obstruct the entrance of so\r\naffectionate a kinsman into the private regions of the house. “Her\r\nbrother seemed to be just falling asleep after breakfast; and I am sure she\r\nwould not like him to be disturbed. Pray, sir, let me give her notice!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the Judge showed a singular determination to enter unannounced; and as\r\nPhœbe, with the vivacity of a person whose movements unconsciously answer to\r\nher thoughts, had stepped towards the door, he used little or no ceremony in\r\nputting her aside.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no, Miss Phœbe!” said Judge Pyncheon in a voice as deep as a\r\nthunder-growl, and with a frown as black as the cloud whence it issues.\r\n“Stay you here! I know the house, and know my cousin Hepzibah, and know\r\nher brother Clifford likewise.—nor need my little country cousin put\r\nherself to the trouble of announcing me!”—in these latter words, by\r\nthe bye, there were symptoms of a change from his sudden harshness into his\r\nprevious benignity of manner. “I am at home here, Phœbe, you must\r\nrecollect, and you are the stranger. I will just step in, therefore, and see\r\nfor myself how Clifford is, and assure him and Hepzibah of my kindly feelings\r\nand best wishes. It is right, at this juncture, that they should both hear from\r\nmy own lips how much I desire to serve them. Ha! here is Hepzibah\r\nherself!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch was the case. The vibrations of the Judge’s voice had reached the\r\nold gentlewoman in the parlor, where she sat, with face averted, waiting on her\r\nbrother’s slumber. She now issued forth, as would appear, to defend the\r\nentrance, looking, we must needs say, amazingly like the dragon which, in fairy\r\ntales, is wont to be the guardian over an enchanted beauty. The habitual scowl\r\nof her brow was undeniably too fierce, at this moment, to pass itself off on\r\nthe innocent score of near-sightedness; and it was bent on Judge Pyncheon in a\r\nway that seemed to confound, if not alarm him, so inadequately had he estimated\r\nthe moral force of a deeply grounded antipathy. She made a repelling gesture\r\nwith her hand, and stood a perfect picture of prohibition, at full length, in\r\nthe dark frame of the doorway. But we must betray Hepzibah’s secret, and\r\nconfess that the native timorousness of her character even now developed itself\r\nin a quick tremor, which, to her own perception, set each of her joints at\r\nvariance with its fellows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPossibly, the Judge was aware how little true hardihood lay behind\r\nHepzibah’s formidable front. At any rate, being a gentleman of steady\r\nnerves, he soon recovered himself, and failed not to approach his cousin with\r\noutstretched hand; adopting the sensible precaution, however, to cover his\r\nadvance with a smile, so broad and sultry, that, had it been only half as warm\r\nas it looked, a trellis of grapes might at once have turned purple under its\r\nsummer-like exposure. It may have been his purpose, indeed, to melt poor\r\nHepzibah on the spot, as if she were a figure of yellow wax.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hepzibah, my beloved cousin, I am rejoiced!” exclaimed the Judge\r\nmost emphatically. “Now, at length, you have something to live for. Yes,\r\nand all of us, let me say, your friends and kindred, have more to live for than\r\nwe had yesterday. I have lost no time in hastening to offer any assistance in\r\nmy power towards making Clifford comfortable. He belongs to us all. I know how\r\nmuch he requires,—how much he used to require,—with his delicate\r\ntaste, and his love of the beautiful. Anything in my house,—pictures,\r\nbooks, wine, luxuries of the table,—he may command them all! It would\r\nafford me most heartfelt gratification to see him! Shall I step in, this\r\nmoment?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” replied Hepzibah, her voice quivering too painfully to allow\r\nof many words. “He cannot see visitors!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A visitor, my dear cousin!—do you call me so?” cried the\r\nJudge, whose sensibility, it seems, was hurt by the coldness of the phrase.\r\n“Nay, then, let me be Clifford’s host, and your own likewise. Come\r\nat once to my house. The country air, and all the conveniences,—I may say\r\nluxuries,—that I have gathered about me, will do wonders for him. And you\r\nand I, dear Hepzibah, will consult together, and watch together, and labor\r\ntogether, to make our dear Clifford happy. Come! why should we make more words\r\nabout what is both a duty and a pleasure on my part? Come to me at once!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn hearing these so hospitable offers, and such generous recognition of the\r\nclaims of kindred, Phœbe felt very much in the mood of running up to Judge\r\nPyncheon, and giving him, of her own accord, the kiss from which she had so\r\nrecently shrunk away. It was quite otherwise with Hepzibah; the Judge’s\r\nsmile seemed to operate on her acerbity of heart like sunshine upon vinegar,\r\nmaking it ten times sourer than ever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford,” said she,—still too agitated to utter more than\r\nan abrupt sentence,—“Clifford has a home here!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“May Heaven forgive you, Hepzibah,” said Judge\r\nPyncheon,—reverently lifting his eyes towards that high court of equity\r\nto which he appealed,—“if you suffer any ancient prejudice or\r\nanimosity to weigh with you in this matter. I stand here with an open heart,\r\nwilling and anxious to receive yourself and Clifford into it. Do not refuse my\r\ngood offices,—my earnest propositions for your welfare! They are such, in\r\nall respects, as it behooves your nearest kinsman to make. It will be a heavy\r\nresponsibility, cousin, if you confine your brother to this dismal house and\r\nstifled air, when the delightful freedom of my country-seat is at his\r\ncommand.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It would never suit Clifford,” said Hepzibah, as briefly as\r\nbefore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Woman!” broke forth the Judge, giving way to his resentment,\r\n“what is the meaning of all this? Have you other resources? Nay, I\r\nsuspected as much! Take care, Hepzibah, take care! Clifford is on the brink of\r\nas black a ruin as ever befell him yet! But why do I talk with you, woman as\r\nyou are? Make way!—I must see Clifford!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah spread out her gaunt figure across the door, and seemed really to\r\nincrease in bulk; looking the more terrible, also, because there was so much\r\nterror and agitation in her heart. But Judge Pyncheon’s evident purpose\r\nof forcing a passage was interrupted by a voice from the inner room; a weak,\r\ntremulous, wailing voice, indicating helpless alarm, with no more energy for\r\nself-defence than belongs to a frightened infant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hepzibah, Hepzibah!” cried the voice; “go down on your knees\r\nto him! Kiss his feet! Entreat him not to come in! Oh, let him have mercy on\r\nme! Mercy! mercy!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor the instant, it appeared doubtful whether it were not the Judge’s\r\nresolute purpose to set Hepzibah aside, and step across the threshold into the\r\nparlor, whence issued that broken and miserable murmur of entreaty. It was not\r\npity that restrained him, for, at the first sound of the enfeebled voice, a red\r\nfire kindled in his eyes, and he made a quick pace forward, with something\r\ninexpressibly fierce and grim darkening forth, as it were, out of the whole\r\nman. To know Judge Pyncheon was to see him at that moment. After such a\r\nrevelation, let him smile with what sultriness he would, he could much sooner\r\nturn grapes purple, or pumpkins yellow, than melt the iron-branded impression\r\nout of the beholder’s memory. And it rendered his aspect not the less,\r\nbut more frightful, that it seemed not to express wrath or hatred, but a\r\ncertain hot fellness of purpose, which annihilated everything but itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, after all, are we not slandering an excellent and amiable man? Look at the\r\nJudge now! He is apparently conscious of having erred, in too energetically\r\npressing his deeds of loving-kindness on persons unable to appreciate them. He\r\nwill await their better mood, and hold himself as ready to assist them then as\r\nat this moment. As he draws back from the door, an all-comprehensive benignity\r\nblazes from his visage, indicating that he gathers Hepzibah, little Phœbe, and\r\nthe invisible Clifford, all three, together with the whole world besides, into\r\nhis immense heart, and gives them a warm bath in its flood of affection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You do me great wrong, dear Cousin Hepzibah!” said he, first\r\nkindly offering her his hand, and then drawing on his glove preparatory to\r\ndeparture. “Very great wrong! But I forgive it, and will study to make\r\nyou think better of me. Of course, our poor Clifford being in so unhappy a\r\nstate of mind, I cannot think of urging an interview at present. But I shall\r\nwatch over his welfare as if he were my own beloved brother; nor do I at all\r\ndespair, my dear cousin, of constraining both him and you to acknowledge your\r\ninjustice. When that shall happen, I desire no other revenge than your\r\nacceptance of the best offices in my power to do you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith a bow to Hepzibah, and a degree of paternal benevolence in his parting nod\r\nto Phœbe, the Judge left the shop, and went smiling along the street. As is\r\ncustomary with the rich, when they aim at the honors of a republic, he\r\napologized, as it were, to the people, for his wealth, prosperity, and elevated\r\nstation, by a free and hearty manner towards those who knew him; putting off\r\nthe more of his dignity in due proportion with the humbleness of the man whom\r\nhe saluted, and thereby proving a haughty consciousness of his advantages as\r\nirrefragably as if he had marched forth preceded by a troop of lackeys to clear\r\nthe way. On this particular forenoon, so excessive was the warmth of Judge\r\nPyncheon’s kindly aspect, that (such, at least, was the rumor about town)\r\nan extra passage of the water-carts was found essential, in order to lay the\r\ndust occasioned by so much extra sunshine!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo sooner had he disappeared than Hepzibah grew deadly white, and, staggering\r\ntowards Phœbe, let her head fall on the young girl’s shoulder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“O Phœbe!” murmured she, “that man has been the horror of my\r\nlife! Shall I never, never have the courage,—will my voice never cease\r\nfrom trembling long enough to let me tell him what he is?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is he so very wicked?” asked Phœbe. “Yet his offers were\r\nsurely kind!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do not speak of them,—he has a heart of iron!” rejoined\r\nHepzibah. “Go, now, and talk to Clifford! Amuse and keep him quiet! It\r\nwould disturb him wretchedly to see me so agitated as I am. There, go, dear\r\nchild, and I will try to look after the shop.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe went accordingly, but perplexed herself, meanwhile, with queries as to\r\nthe purport of the scene which she had just witnessed, and also whether judges,\r\nclergymen, and other characters of that eminent stamp and respectability, could\r\nreally, in any single instance, be otherwise than just and upright men. A doubt\r\nof this nature has a most disturbing influence, and, if shown to be a fact,\r\ncomes with fearful and startling effect on minds of the trim, orderly, and\r\nlimit-loving class, in which we find our little country-girl. Dispositions more\r\nboldly speculative may derive a stern enjoyment from the discovery, since there\r\nmust be evil in the world, that a high man is as likely to grasp his share of\r\nit as a low one. A wider scope of view, and a deeper insight, may see rank,\r\ndignity, and station, all proved illusory, so far as regards their claim to\r\nhuman reverence, and yet not feel as if the universe were thereby tumbled\r\nheadlong into chaos. But Phœbe, in order to keep the universe in its old\r\nplace, was fain to smother, in some degree, her own intuitions as to Judge\r\nPyncheon’s character. And as for her cousin’s testimony in\r\ndisparagement of it, she concluded that Hepzibah’s judgment was\r\nembittered by one of those family feuds which render hatred the more deadly by\r\nthe dead and corrupted love that they intermingle with its native poison.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap09\"></a>IX.<br>\r\nClifford and Phœbe</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTruly was there something high, generous, and noble in the native composition\r\nof our poor old Hepzibah! Or else,—and it was quite as probably the\r\ncase,—she had been enriched by poverty, developed by sorrow, elevated by\r\nthe strong and solitary affection of her life, and thus endowed with heroism,\r\nwhich never could have characterized her in what are called happier\r\ncircumstances. Through dreary years Hepzibah had looked forward—for the\r\nmost part despairingly, never with any confidence of hope, but always with the\r\nfeeling that it was her brightest possibility—to the very position in\r\nwhich she now found herself. In her own behalf, she had asked nothing of\r\nProvidence but the opportunity of devoting herself to this brother, whom she\r\nhad so loved,—so admired for what he was, or might have been,—and\r\nto whom she had kept her faith, alone of all the world, wholly, unfalteringly,\r\nat every instant, and throughout life. And here, in his late decline, the lost\r\none had come back out of his long and strange misfortune, and was thrown on her\r\nsympathy, as it seemed, not merely for the bread of his physical existence, but\r\nfor everything that should keep him morally alive. She had responded to the\r\ncall. She had come forward,—our poor, gaunt Hepzibah, in her rusty silks,\r\nwith her rigid joints, and the sad perversity of her scowl,—ready to do\r\nher utmost; and with affection enough, if that were all, to do a hundred times\r\nas much! There could be few more tearful sights,—and Heaven forgive us if\r\na smile insist on mingling with our conception of it!—few sights with\r\ntruer pathos in them, than Hepzibah presented on that first afternoon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow patiently did she endeavor to wrap Clifford up in her great, warm love, and\r\nmake it all the world to him, so that he should retain no torturing sense of\r\nthe coldness and dreariness without! Her little efforts to amuse him! How\r\npitiful, yet magnanimous, they were!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRemembering his early love of poetry and fiction, she unlocked a bookcase, and\r\ntook down several books that had been excellent reading in their day. There was\r\na volume of Pope, with the Rape of the Lock in it, and another of the Tatler,\r\nand an odd one of Dryden’s Miscellanies, all with tarnished gilding on\r\ntheir covers, and thoughts of tarnished brilliancy inside. They had no success\r\nwith Clifford. These, and all such writers of society, whose new works glow\r\nlike the rich texture of a just-woven carpet, must be content to relinquish\r\ntheir charm, for every reader, after an age or two, and could hardly be\r\nsupposed to retain any portion of it for a mind that had utterly lost its\r\nestimate of modes and manners. Hepzibah then took up Rasselas, and began to\r\nread of the Happy Valley, with a vague idea that some secret of a contented\r\nlife had there been elaborated, which might at least serve Clifford and herself\r\nfor this one day. But the Happy Valley had a cloud over it. Hepzibah troubled\r\nher auditor, moreover, by innumerable sins of emphasis, which he seemed to\r\ndetect, without any reference to the meaning; nor, in fact, did he appear to\r\ntake much note of the sense of what she read, but evidently felt the tedium of\r\nthe lecture, without harvesting its profit. His sister’s voice, too,\r\nnaturally harsh, had, in the course of her sorrowful lifetime, contracted a\r\nkind of croak, which, when it once gets into the human throat, is as\r\nineradicable as sin. In both sexes, occasionally, this lifelong croak,\r\naccompanying each word of joy or sorrow, is one of the symptoms of a settled\r\nmelancholy; and wherever it occurs, the whole history of misfortune is conveyed\r\nin its slightest accent. The effect is as if the voice had been dyed black;\r\nor,—if we must use a more moderate simile,—this miserable croak,\r\nrunning through all the variations of the voice, is like a black silken thread,\r\non which the crystal beads of speech are strung, and whence they take their\r\nhue. Such voices have put on mourning for dead hopes; and they ought to die and\r\nbe buried along with them!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDiscerning that Clifford was not gladdened by her efforts, Hepzibah searched\r\nabout the house for the means of more exhilarating pastime. At one time, her\r\neyes chanced to rest on Alice Pyncheon’s harpsichord. It was a moment of\r\ngreat peril; for,—despite the traditionary awe that had gathered over\r\nthis instrument of music, and the dirges which spiritual fingers were said to\r\nplay on it,—the devoted sister had solemn thoughts of thrumming on its\r\nchords for Clifford’s benefit, and accompanying the performance with her\r\nvoice. Poor Clifford! Poor Hepzibah! Poor harpsichord! All three would have\r\nbeen miserable together. By some good agency,—possibly, by the\r\nunrecognized interposition of the long-buried Alice herself,—the\r\nthreatening calamity was averted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the worst of all—the hardest stroke of fate for Hepzibah to endure,\r\nand perhaps for Clifford, too was his invincible distaste for her appearance.\r\nHer features, never the most agreeable, and now harsh with age and grief, and\r\nresentment against the world for his sake; her dress, and especially her\r\nturban; the queer and quaint manners, which had unconsciously grown upon her in\r\nsolitude,—such being the poor gentlewoman’s outward\r\ncharacteristics, it is no great marvel, although the mournfullest of pities,\r\nthat the instinctive lover of the Beautiful was fain to turn away his eyes.\r\nThere was no help for it. It would be the latest impulse to die within him. In\r\nhis last extremity, the expiring breath stealing faintly through\r\nClifford’s lips, he would doubtless press Hepzibah’s hand, in\r\nfervent recognition of all her lavished love, and close his eyes,—but not\r\nso much to die, as to be constrained to look no longer on her face! Poor\r\nHepzibah! She took counsel with herself what might be done, and thought of\r\nputting ribbons on her turban; but, by the instant rush of several guardian\r\nangels, was withheld from an experiment that could hardly have proved less than\r\nfatal to the beloved object of her anxiety.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo be brief, besides Hepzibah’s disadvantages of person, there was an\r\nuncouthness pervading all her deeds; a clumsy something, that could but ill\r\nadapt itself for use, and not at all for ornament. She was a grief to Clifford,\r\nand she knew it. In this extremity, the antiquated virgin turned to Phœbe. No\r\ngrovelling jealousy was in her heart. Had it pleased Heaven to crown the heroic\r\nfidelity of her life by making her personally the medium of Clifford’s\r\nhappiness, it would have rewarded her for all the past, by a joy with no bright\r\ntints, indeed, but deep and true, and worth a thousand gayer ecstasies. This\r\ncould not be. She therefore turned to Phœbe, and resigned the task into the\r\nyoung girl’s hands. The latter took it up cheerfully, as she did\r\neverything, but with no sense of a mission to perform, and succeeding all the\r\nbetter for that same simplicity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the involuntary effect of a genial temperament, Phœbe soon grew to be\r\nabsolutely essential to the daily comfort, if not the daily life, of her two\r\nforlorn companions. The grime and sordidness of the House of the Seven Gables\r\nseemed to have vanished since her appearance there; the gnawing tooth of the\r\ndry-rot was stayed among the old timbers of its skeleton frame; the dust had\r\nceased to settle down so densely, from the antique ceilings, upon the floors\r\nand furniture of the rooms below,—or, at any rate, there was a little\r\nhousewife, as light-footed as the breeze that sweeps a garden walk, gliding\r\nhither and thither to brush it all away. The shadows of gloomy events that\r\nhaunted the else lonely and desolate apartments; the heavy, breathless scent\r\nwhich death had left in more than one of the bedchambers, ever since his visits\r\nof long ago,—these were less powerful than the purifying influence\r\nscattered throughout the atmosphere of the household by the presence of one\r\nyouthful, fresh, and thoroughly wholesome heart. There was no morbidness in\r\nPhœbe; if there had been, the old Pyncheon House was the very locality to\r\nripen it into incurable disease. But now her spirit resembled, in its potency,\r\na minute quantity of ottar of rose in one of Hepzibah’s huge, iron-bound\r\ntrunks, diffusing its fragrance through the various articles of linen and\r\nwrought-lace, kerchiefs, caps, stockings, folded dresses, gloves, and whatever\r\nelse was treasured there. As every article in the great trunk was the sweeter\r\nfor the rose-scent, so did all the thoughts and emotions of Hepzibah and\r\nClifford, sombre as they might seem, acquire a subtle attribute of happiness\r\nfrom Phœbe’s intermixture with them. Her activity of body, intellect,\r\nand heart impelled her continually to perform the ordinary little toils that\r\noffered themselves around her, and to think the thought proper for the moment,\r\nand to sympathize,—now with the twittering gayety of the robins in the\r\npear-tree, and now to such a depth as she could with Hepzibah’s dark\r\nanxiety, or the vague moan of her brother. This facile adaptation was at once\r\nthe symptom of perfect health and its best preservative.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA nature like Phœbe’s has invariably its due influence, but is seldom\r\nregarded with due honor. Its spiritual force, however, may be partially\r\nestimated by the fact of her having found a place for herself, amid\r\ncircumstances so stern as those which surrounded the mistress of the house; and\r\nalso by the effect which she produced on a character of so much more mass than\r\nher own. For the gaunt, bony frame and limbs of Hepzibah, as compared with the\r\ntiny lightsomeness of Phœbe’s figure, were perhaps in some fit\r\nproportion with the moral weight and substance, respectively, of the woman and\r\nthe girl.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo the guest,—to Hepzibah’s brother,—or Cousin Clifford, as\r\nPhœbe now began to call him,—she was especially necessary. Not that he\r\ncould ever be said to converse with her, or often manifest, in any other very\r\ndefinite mode, his sense of a charm in her society. But if she were a long\r\nwhile absent he became pettish and nervously restless, pacing the room to and\r\nfro with the uncertainty that characterized all his movements; or else would\r\nsit broodingly in his great chair, resting his head on his hands, and evincing\r\nlife only by an electric sparkle of ill-humor, whenever Hepzibah endeavored to\r\narouse him. Phœbe’s presence, and the contiguity of her fresh life to\r\nhis blighted one, was usually all that he required. Indeed, such was the native\r\ngush and play of her spirit, that she was seldom perfectly quiet and\r\nundemonstrative, any more than a fountain ever ceases to dimple and warble with\r\nits flow. She possessed the gift of song, and that, too, so naturally, that you\r\nwould as little think of inquiring whence she had caught it, or what master had\r\ntaught her, as of asking the same questions about a bird, in whose small strain\r\nof music we recognize the voice of the Creator as distinctly as in the loudest\r\naccents of his thunder. So long as Phœbe sang, she might stray at her own will\r\nabout the house. Clifford was content, whether the sweet, airy homeliness of\r\nher tones came down from the upper chambers, or along the passageway from the\r\nshop, or was sprinkled through the foliage of the pear-tree, inward from the\r\ngarden, with the twinkling sunbeams. He would sit quietly, with a gentle\r\npleasure gleaming over his face, brighter now, and now a little dimmer, as the\r\nsong happened to float near him, or was more remotely heard. It pleased him\r\nbest, however, when she sat on a low footstool at his knee.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is perhaps remarkable, considering her temperament, that Phœbe oftener\r\nchose a strain of pathos than of gayety. But the young and happy are not ill\r\npleased to temper their life with a transparent shadow. The deepest pathos of\r\nPhœbe’s voice and song, moreover, came sifted through the golden texture\r\nof a cheery spirit, and was somehow so interfused with the quality thence\r\nacquired, that one’s heart felt all the lighter for having wept at it.\r\nBroad mirth, in the sacred presence of dark misfortune, would have jarred\r\nharshly and irreverently with the solemn symphony that rolled its undertone\r\nthrough Hepzibah’s and her brother’s life. Therefore, it was well\r\nthat Phœbe so often chose sad themes, and not amiss that they ceased to be so\r\nsad while she was singing them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecoming habituated to her companionship, Clifford readily showed how capable\r\nof imbibing pleasant tints and gleams of cheerful light from all quarters his\r\nnature must originally have been. He grew youthful while she sat by him. A\r\nbeauty,—not precisely real, even in its utmost manifestation, and which a\r\npainter would have watched long to seize and fix upon his canvas, and, after\r\nall, in vain,—beauty, nevertheless, that was not a mere dream, would\r\nsometimes play upon and illuminate his face. It did more than to illuminate; it\r\ntransfigured him with an expression that could only be interpreted as the glow\r\nof an exquisite and happy spirit. That gray hair, and those furrows,—with\r\ntheir record of infinite sorrow so deeply written across his brow, and so\r\ncompressed, as with a futile effort to crowd in all the tale, that the whole\r\ninscription was made illegible,—these, for the moment, vanished. An eye\r\nat once tender and acute might have beheld in the man some shadow of what he\r\nwas meant to be. Anon, as age came stealing, like a sad twilight, back over his\r\nfigure, you would have felt tempted to hold an argument with Destiny, and\r\naffirm, that either this being should not have been made mortal, or mortal\r\nexistence should have been tempered to his qualities. There seemed no necessity\r\nfor his having drawn breath at all; the world never wanted him; but, as he had\r\nbreathed, it ought always to have been the balmiest of summer air. The same\r\nperplexity will invariably haunt us with regard to natures that tend to feed\r\nexclusively upon the Beautiful, let their earthly fate be as lenient as it may.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe, it is probable, had but a very imperfect comprehension of the character\r\nover which she had thrown so beneficent a spell. Nor was it necessary. The fire\r\nupon the hearth can gladden a whole semicircle of faces round about it, but\r\nneed not know the individuality of one among them all. Indeed, there was\r\nsomething too fine and delicate in Clifford’s traits to be perfectly\r\nappreciated by one whose sphere lay so much in the Actual as Phœbe’s\r\ndid. For Clifford, however, the reality, and simplicity, and thorough\r\nhomeliness of the girl’s nature were as powerful a charm as any that she\r\npossessed. Beauty, it is true, and beauty almost perfect in its own style, was\r\nindispensable. Had Phœbe been coarse in feature, shaped clumsily, of a harsh\r\nvoice, and uncouthly mannered, she might have been rich with all good gifts,\r\nbeneath this unfortunate exterior, and still, so long as she wore the guise of\r\nwoman, she would have shocked Clifford, and depressed him by her lack of\r\nbeauty. But nothing more beautiful—nothing prettier, at least—was\r\never made than Phœbe. And, therefore, to this man,—whose whole poor and\r\nimpalpable enjoyment of existence heretofore, and until both his heart and\r\nfancy died within him, had been a dream,—whose images of women had more\r\nand more lost their warmth and substance, and been frozen, like the pictures of\r\nsecluded artists, into the chillest ideality,—to him, this little figure\r\nof the cheeriest household life was just what he required to bring him back\r\ninto the breathing world. Persons who have wandered, or been expelled, out of\r\nthe common track of things, even were it for a better system, desire nothing so\r\nmuch as to be led back. They shiver in their loneliness, be it on a\r\nmountain-top or in a dungeon. Now, Phœbe’s presence made a home about\r\nher,—that very sphere which the outcast, the prisoner, the\r\npotentate,—the wretch beneath mankind, the wretch aside from it, or the\r\nwretch above it,—instinctively pines after,—a home! She was real!\r\nHolding her hand, you felt something; a tender something; a substance, and a\r\nwarm one: and so long as you should feel its grasp, soft as it was, you might\r\nbe certain that your place was good in the whole sympathetic chain of human\r\nnature. The world was no longer a delusion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy looking a little further in this direction, we might suggest an explanation\r\nof an often-suggested mystery. Why are poets so apt to choose their mates, not\r\nfor any similarity of poetic endowment, but for qualities which might make the\r\nhappiness of the rudest handicraftsman as well as that of the ideal craftsman\r\nof the spirit? Because, probably, at his highest elevation, the poet needs no\r\nhuman intercourse; but he finds it dreary to descend, and be a stranger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was something very beautiful in the relation that grew up between this\r\npair, so closely and constantly linked together, yet with such a waste of\r\ngloomy and mysterious years from his birthday to hers. On Clifford’s part\r\nit was the feeling of a man naturally endowed with the liveliest sensibility to\r\nfeminine influence, but who had never quaffed the cup of passionate love, and\r\nknew that it was now too late. He knew it, with the instinctive delicacy that\r\nhad survived his intellectual decay. Thus, his sentiment for Phœbe, without\r\nbeing paternal, was not less chaste than if she had been his daughter. He was a\r\nman, it is true, and recognized her as a woman. She was his only representative\r\nof womankind. He took unfailing note of every charm that appertained to her\r\nsex, and saw the ripeness of her lips, and the virginal development of her\r\nbosom. All her little womanly ways, budding out of her like blossoms on a young\r\nfruit-tree, had their effect on him, and sometimes caused his very heart to\r\ntingle with the keenest thrills of pleasure. At such moments,—for the\r\neffect was seldom more than momentary,—the half-torpid man would be full\r\nof harmonious life, just as a long-silent harp is full of sound, when the\r\nmusician’s fingers sweep across it. But, after all, it seemed rather a\r\nperception, or a sympathy, than a sentiment belonging to himself as an\r\nindividual. He read Phœbe as he would a sweet and simple story; he listened to\r\nher as if she were a verse of household poetry, which God, in requital of his\r\nbleak and dismal lot, had permitted some angel, that most pitied him, to warble\r\nthrough the house. She was not an actual fact for him, but the interpretation\r\nof all that he lacked on earth brought warmly home to his conception; so that\r\nthis mere symbol, or life-like picture, had almost the comfort of reality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut we strive in vain to put the idea into words. No adequate expression of the\r\nbeauty and profound pathos with which it impresses us is attainable. This\r\nbeing, made only for happiness, and heretofore so miserably failing to be\r\nhappy,—his tendencies so hideously thwarted, that, some unknown time ago,\r\nthe delicate springs of his character, never morally or intellectually strong,\r\nhad given way, and he was now imbecile,—this poor, forlorn voyager from\r\nthe Islands of the Blest, in a frail bark, on a tempestuous sea, had been\r\nflung, by the last mountain-wave of his shipwreck, into a quiet harbor. There,\r\nas he lay more than half lifeless on the strand, the fragrance of an earthly\r\nrose-bud had come to his nostrils, and, as odors will, had summoned up\r\nreminiscences or visions of all the living and breathing beauty amid which he\r\nshould have had his home. With his native susceptibility of happy influences,\r\nhe inhales the slight, ethereal rapture into his soul, and expires!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd how did Phœbe regard Clifford? The girl’s was not one of those\r\nnatures which are most attracted by what is strange and exceptional in human\r\ncharacter. The path which would best have suited her was the well-worn track of\r\nordinary life; the companions in whom she would most have delighted were such\r\nas one encounters at every turn. The mystery which enveloped Clifford, so far\r\nas it affected her at all, was an annoyance, rather than the piquant charm\r\nwhich many women might have found in it. Still, her native kindliness was\r\nbrought strongly into play, not by what was darkly picturesque in his\r\nsituation, nor so much, even, by the finer graces of his character, as by the\r\nsimple appeal of a heart so forlorn as his to one so full of genuine sympathy\r\nas hers. She gave him an affectionate regard, because he needed so much love,\r\nand seemed to have received so little. With a ready tact, the result of\r\never-active and wholesome sensibility, she discerned what was good for him, and\r\ndid it. Whatever was morbid in his mind and experience she ignored; and thereby\r\nkept their intercourse healthy, by the incautious, but, as it were,\r\nheaven-directed freedom of her whole conduct. The sick in mind, and, perhaps,\r\nin body, are rendered more darkly and hopelessly so by the manifold reflection\r\nof their disease, mirrored back from all quarters in the deportment of those\r\nabout them; they are compelled to inhale the poison of their own breath, in\r\ninfinite repetition. But Phœbe afforded her poor patient a supply of purer\r\nair. She impregnated it, too, not with a wild-flower scent,—for wildness\r\nwas no trait of hers,—but with the perfume of garden-roses, pinks, and\r\nother blossoms of much sweetness, which nature and man have consented together\r\nin making grow from summer to summer, and from century to century. Such a\r\nflower was Phœbe in her relation with Clifford, and such the delight that he\r\ninhaled from her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, it must be said, her petals sometimes drooped a little, in consequence of\r\nthe heavy atmosphere about her. She grew more thoughtful than heretofore.\r\nLooking aside at Clifford’s face, and seeing the dim, unsatisfactory\r\nelegance and the intellect almost quenched, she would try to inquire what had\r\nbeen his life. Was he always thus? Had this veil been over him from his\r\nbirth?—this veil, under which far more of his spirit was hidden than\r\nrevealed, and through which he so imperfectly discerned the actual\r\nworld,—or was its gray texture woven of some dark calamity? Phœbe loved\r\nno riddles, and would have been glad to escape the perplexity of this one.\r\nNevertheless, there was so far a good result of her meditations on\r\nClifford’s character, that, when her involuntary conjectures, together\r\nwith the tendency of every strange circumstance to tell its own story, had\r\ngradually taught her the fact, it had no terrible effect upon her. Let the\r\nworld have done him what vast wrong it might, she knew Cousin Clifford too\r\nwell—or fancied so—ever to shudder at the touch of his thin,\r\ndelicate fingers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWithin a few days after the appearance of this remarkable inmate, the routine\r\nof life had established itself with a good deal of uniformity in the old house\r\nof our narrative. In the morning, very shortly after breakfast, it was\r\nClifford’s custom to fall asleep in his chair; nor, unless accidentally\r\ndisturbed, would he emerge from a dense cloud of slumber or the thinner mists\r\nthat flitted to and fro, until well towards noonday. These hours of drowsihead\r\nwere the season of the old gentlewoman’s attendance on her brother, while\r\nPhœbe took charge of the shop; an arrangement which the public speedily\r\nunderstood, and evinced their decided preference of the younger shopwoman by\r\nthe multiplicity of their calls during her administration of affairs. Dinner\r\nover, Hepzibah took her knitting-work,—a long stocking of gray yarn, for\r\nher brother’s winter wear,—and with a sigh, and a scowl of\r\naffectionate farewell to Clifford, and a gesture enjoining watchfulness on\r\nPhœbe, went to take her seat behind the counter. It was now the young\r\ngirl’s turn to be the nurse,—the guardian, the playmate,—or\r\nwhatever is the fitter phrase,—of the gray-haired man.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap10\"></a>X.<br>\r\nThe Pyncheon Garden</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford, except for Phœbe’s more active instigation would ordinarily\r\nhave yielded to the torpor which had crept through all his modes of being, and\r\nwhich sluggishly counselled him to sit in his morning chair till eventide. But\r\nthe girl seldom failed to propose a removal to the garden, where Uncle Venner\r\nand the daguerreotypist had made such repairs on the roof of the ruinous arbor,\r\nor summer-house, that it was now a sufficient shelter from sunshine and casual\r\nshowers. The hop-vine, too, had begun to grow luxuriantly over the sides of the\r\nlittle edifice, and made an interior of verdant seclusion, with innumerable\r\npeeps and glimpses into the wider solitude of the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere, sometimes, in this green play-place of flickering light, Phœbe read to\r\nClifford. Her acquaintance, the artist, who appeared to have a literary turn,\r\nhad supplied her with works of fiction, in pamphlet form,—and a few\r\nvolumes of poetry, in altogether a different style and taste from those which\r\nHepzibah selected for his amusement. Small thanks were due to the books,\r\nhowever, if the girl’s readings were in any degree more successful than\r\nher elderly cousin’s. Phœbe’s voice had always a pretty music in\r\nit, and could either enliven Clifford by its sparkle and gayety of tone, or\r\nsoothe him by a continued flow of pebbly and brook-like cadences. But the\r\nfictions—in which the country-girl, unused to works of that nature, often\r\nbecame deeply absorbed—interested her strange auditor very little, or not\r\nat all. Pictures of life, scenes of passion or sentiment, wit, humor, and\r\npathos, were all thrown away, or worse than thrown away, on Clifford; either\r\nbecause he lacked an experience by which to test their truth, or because his\r\nown griefs were a touch-stone of reality that few feigned emotions could\r\nwithstand. When Phœbe broke into a peal of merry laughter at what she read, he\r\nwould now and then laugh for sympathy, but oftener respond with a troubled,\r\nquestioning look. If a tear—a maiden’s sunshiny tear over imaginary\r\nwoe—dropped upon some melancholy page, Clifford either took it as a token\r\nof actual calamity, or else grew peevish, and angrily motioned her to close the\r\nvolume. And wisely too! Is not the world sad enough, in genuine earnest,\r\nwithout making a pastime of mock sorrows?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith poetry it was rather better. He delighted in the swell and subsidence of\r\nthe rhythm, and the happily recurring rhyme. Nor was Clifford incapable of\r\nfeeling the sentiment of poetry,—not, perhaps, where it was highest or\r\ndeepest, but where it was most flitting and ethereal. It was impossible to\r\nforetell in what exquisite verse the awakening spell might lurk; but, on\r\nraising her eyes from the page to Clifford’s face, Phœbe would be made\r\naware, by the light breaking through it, that a more delicate intelligence than\r\nher own had caught a lambent flame from what she read. One glow of this kind,\r\nhowever, was often the precursor of gloom for many hours afterward; because,\r\nwhen the glow left him, he seemed conscious of a missing sense and power, and\r\ngroped about for them, as if a blind man should go seeking his lost eyesight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt pleased him more, and was better for his inward welfare, that Phœbe should\r\ntalk, and make passing occurrences vivid to his mind by her accompanying\r\ndescription and remarks. The life of the garden offered topics enough for such\r\ndiscourse as suited Clifford best. He never failed to inquire what flowers had\r\nbloomed since yesterday. His feeling for flowers was very exquisite, and seemed\r\nnot so much a taste as an emotion; he was fond of sitting with one in his hand,\r\nintently observing it, and looking from its petals into Phœbe’s face, as\r\nif the garden flower were the sister of the household maiden. Not merely was\r\nthere a delight in the flower’s perfume, or pleasure in its beautiful\r\nform, and the delicacy or brightness of its hue; but Clifford’s enjoyment\r\nwas accompanied with a perception of life, character, and individuality, that\r\nmade him love these blossoms of the garden, as if they were endowed with\r\nsentiment and intelligence. This affection and sympathy for flowers is almost\r\nexclusively a woman’s trait. Men, if endowed with it by nature, soon\r\nlose, forget, and learn to despise it, in their contact with coarser things\r\nthan flowers. Clifford, too, had long forgotten it; but found it again now, as\r\nhe slowly revived from the chill torpor of his life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is wonderful how many pleasant incidents continually came to pass in that\r\nsecluded garden-spot when once Phœbe had set herself to look for them. She had\r\nseen or heard a bee there, on the first day of her acquaintance with the place.\r\nAnd often,—almost continually, indeed,—since then, the bees kept\r\ncoming thither, Heaven knows why, or by what pertinacious desire, for\r\nfar-fetched sweets, when, no doubt, there were broad clover-fields, and all\r\nkinds of garden growth, much nearer home than this. Thither the bees came,\r\nhowever, and plunged into the squash-blossoms, as if there were no other\r\nsquash-vines within a long day’s flight, or as if the soil of\r\nHepzibah’s garden gave its productions just the very quality which these\r\nlaborious little wizards wanted, in order to impart the Hymettus odor to their\r\nwhole hive of New England honey. When Clifford heard their sunny, buzzing\r\nmurmur, in the heart of the great yellow blossoms, he looked about him with a\r\njoyful sense of warmth, and blue sky, and green grass, and of God’s free\r\nair in the whole height from earth to heaven. After all, there need be no\r\nquestion why the bees came to that one green nook in the dusty town. God sent\r\nthem thither to gladden our poor Clifford. They brought the rich summer with\r\nthem, in requital of a little honey.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the bean-vines began to flower on the poles, there was one particular\r\nvariety which bore a vivid scarlet blossom. The daguerreotypist had found these\r\nbeans in a garret, over one of the seven gables, treasured up in an old chest\r\nof drawers by some horticultural Pyncheon of days gone by, who doubtless meant\r\nto sow them the next summer, but was himself first sown in Death’s\r\ngarden-ground. By way of testing whether there were still a living germ in such\r\nancient seeds, Holgrave had planted some of them; and the result of his\r\nexperiment was a splendid row of bean-vines, clambering, early, to the full\r\nheight of the poles, and arraying them, from top to bottom, in a spiral\r\nprofusion of red blossoms. And, ever since the unfolding of the first bud, a\r\nmultitude of humming-birds had been attracted thither. At times, it seemed as\r\nif for every one of the hundred blossoms there was one of these tiniest fowls\r\nof the air,—a thumb’s bigness of burnished plumage, hovering and\r\nvibrating about the bean-poles. It was with indescribable interest, and even\r\nmore than childish delight, that Clifford watched the humming-birds. He used to\r\nthrust his head softly out of the arbor to see them the better; all the while,\r\ntoo, motioning Phœbe to be quiet, and snatching glimpses of the smile upon her\r\nface, so as to heap his enjoyment up the higher with her sympathy. He had not\r\nmerely grown young;—he was a child again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah, whenever she happened to witness one of these fits of miniature\r\nenthusiasm, would shake her head, with a strange mingling of the mother and\r\nsister, and of pleasure and sadness, in her aspect. She said that it had always\r\nbeen thus with Clifford when the humming-birds came,—always, from his\r\nbabyhood,—and that his delight in them had been one of the earliest\r\ntokens by which he showed his love for beautiful things. And it was a wonderful\r\ncoincidence, the good lady thought, that the artist should have planted these\r\nscarlet-flowering beans—which the humming-birds sought far and wide, and\r\nwhich had not grown in the Pyncheon garden before for forty years—on the\r\nvery summer of Clifford’s return.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen would the tears stand in poor Hepzibah’s eyes, or overflow them with\r\na too abundant gush, so that she was fain to betake herself into some corner,\r\nlest Clifford should espy her agitation. Indeed, all the enjoyments of this\r\nperiod were provocative of tears. Coming so late as it did, it was a kind of\r\nIndian summer, with a mist in its balmiest sunshine, and decay and death in its\r\ngaudiest delight. The more Clifford seemed to taste the happiness of a child,\r\nthe sadder was the difference to be recognized. With a mysterious and terrible\r\nPast, which had annihilated his memory, and a blank Future before him, he had\r\nonly this visionary and impalpable Now, which, if you once look closely at it,\r\nis nothing. He himself, as was perceptible by many symptoms, lay darkly behind\r\nhis pleasure, and knew it to be a baby-play, which he was to toy and trifle\r\nwith, instead of thoroughly believing. Clifford saw, it may be, in the mirror\r\nof his deeper consciousness, that he was an example and representative of that\r\ngreat class of people whom an inexplicable Providence is continually putting at\r\ncross-purposes with the world: breaking what seems its own promise in their\r\nnature; withholding their proper food, and setting poison before them for a\r\nbanquet; and thus—when it might so easily, as one would think, have been\r\nadjusted otherwise—making their existence a strangeness, a solitude, and\r\ntorment. All his life long, he had been learning how to be wretched, as one\r\nlearns a foreign tongue; and now, with the lesson thoroughly by heart, he could\r\nwith difficulty comprehend his little airy happiness. Frequently there was a\r\ndim shadow of doubt in his eyes. “Take my hand, Phœbe,” he would\r\nsay, “and pinch it hard with your little fingers! Give me a rose, that I\r\nmay press its thorns, and prove myself awake by the sharp touch of pain!”\r\nEvidently, he desired this prick of a trifling anguish, in order to assure\r\nhimself, by that quality which he best knew to be real, that the garden, and\r\nthe seven weather-beaten gables, and Hepzibah’s scowl, and Phœbe’s\r\nsmile, were real likewise. Without this signet in his flesh, he could have\r\nattributed no more substance to them than to the empty confusion of imaginary\r\nscenes with which he had fed his spirit, until even that poor sustenance was\r\nexhausted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe author needs great faith in his reader’s sympathy; else he must\r\nhesitate to give details so minute, and incidents apparently so trifling, as\r\nare essential to make up the idea of this garden-life. It was the Eden of a\r\nthunder-smitten Adam, who had fled for refuge thither out of the same dreary\r\nand perilous wilderness into which the original Adam was expelled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the available means of amusement, of which Phœbe made the most in\r\nClifford’s behalf, was that feathered society, the hens, a breed of whom,\r\nas we have already said, was an immemorial heirloom in the Pyncheon family. In\r\ncompliance with a whim of Clifford, as it troubled him to see them in\r\nconfinement, they had been set at liberty, and now roamed at will about the\r\ngarden; doing some little mischief, but hindered from escape by buildings on\r\nthree sides, and the difficult peaks of a wooden fence on the other. They spent\r\nmuch of their abundant leisure on the margin of Maule’s well, which was\r\nhaunted by a kind of snail, evidently a titbit to their palates; and the\r\nbrackish water itself, however nauseous to the rest of the world, was so\r\ngreatly esteemed by these fowls, that they might be seen tasting, turning up\r\ntheir heads, and smacking their bills, with precisely the air of wine-bibbers\r\nround a probationary cask. Their generally quiet, yet often brisk, and\r\nconstantly diversified talk, one to another, or sometimes in\r\nsoliloquy,—as they scratched worms out of the rich, black soil, or pecked\r\nat such plants as suited their taste,—had such a domestic tone, that it\r\nwas almost a wonder why you could not establish a regular interchange of ideas\r\nabout household matters, human and gallinaceous. All hens are well worth\r\nstudying for the piquancy and rich variety of their manners; but by no\r\npossibility can there have been other fowls of such odd appearance and\r\ndeportment as these ancestral ones. They probably embodied the traditionary\r\npeculiarities of their whole line of progenitors, derived through an unbroken\r\nsuccession of eggs; or else this individual Chanticleer and his two wives had\r\ngrown to be humorists, and a little crack-brained withal, on account of their\r\nsolitary way of life, and out of sympathy for Hepzibah, their lady-patroness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nQueer, indeed, they looked! Chanticleer himself, though stalking on two\r\nstilt-like legs, with the dignity of interminable descent in all his gestures,\r\nwas hardly bigger than an ordinary partridge; his two wives were about the size\r\nof quails; and as for the one chicken, it looked small enough to be still in\r\nthe egg, and, at the same time, sufficiently old, withered, wizened, and\r\nexperienced, to have been founder of the antiquated race. Instead of being the\r\nyoungest of the family, it rather seemed to have aggregated into itself the\r\nages, not only of these living specimens of the breed, but of all its\r\nforefathers and foremothers, whose united excellences and oddities were\r\nsqueezed into its little body. Its mother evidently regarded it as the one\r\nchicken of the world, and as necessary, in fact, to the world’s\r\ncontinuance, or, at any rate, to the equilibrium of the present system of\r\naffairs, whether in church or state. No lesser sense of the infant fowl’s\r\nimportance could have justified, even in a mother’s eyes, the\r\nperseverance with which she watched over its safety, ruffling her small person\r\nto twice its proper size, and flying in everybody’s face that so much as\r\nlooked towards her hopeful progeny. No lower estimate could have vindicated the\r\nindefatigable zeal with which she scratched, and her unscrupulousness in\r\ndigging up the choicest flower or vegetable, for the sake of the fat earthworm\r\nat its root. Her nervous cluck, when the chicken happened to be hidden in the\r\nlong grass or under the squash-leaves; her gentle croak of satisfaction, while\r\nsure of it beneath her wing; her note of ill-concealed fear and obstreperous\r\ndefiance, when she saw her arch-enemy, a neighbor’s cat, on the top of\r\nthe high fence,—one or other of these sounds was to be heard at almost\r\nevery moment of the day. By degrees, the observer came to feel nearly as much\r\ninterest in this chicken of illustrious race as the mother-hen did.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe, after getting well acquainted with the old hen, was sometimes permitted\r\nto take the chicken in her hand, which was quite capable of grasping its cubic\r\ninch or two of body. While she curiously examined its hereditary\r\nmarks,—the peculiar speckle of its plumage, the funny tuft on its head,\r\nand a knob on each of its legs,—the little biped, as she insisted, kept\r\ngiving her a sagacious wink. The daguerreotypist once whispered her that these\r\nmarks betokened the oddities of the Pyncheon family, and that the chicken\r\nitself was a symbol of the life of the old house, embodying its interpretation,\r\nlikewise, although an unintelligible one, as such clews generally are. It was a\r\nfeathered riddle; a mystery hatched out of an egg, and just as mysterious as if\r\nthe egg had been addle!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe second of Chanticleer’s two wives, ever since Phœbe’s arrival,\r\nhad been in a state of heavy despondency, caused, as it afterwards appeared, by\r\nher inability to lay an egg. One day, however, by her self-important gait, the\r\nsideways turn of her head, and the cock of her eye, as she pried into one and\r\nanother nook of the garden,—croaking to herself, all the while, with\r\ninexpressible complacency,—it was made evident that this identical hen,\r\nmuch as mankind undervalued her, carried something about her person the worth\r\nof which was not to be estimated either in gold or precious stones. Shortly\r\nafter, there was a prodigious cackling and gratulation of Chanticleer and all\r\nhis family, including the wizened chicken, who appeared to understand the\r\nmatter quite as well as did his sire, his mother, or his aunt. That afternoon\r\nPhœbe found a diminutive egg,—not in the regular nest, it was far too\r\nprecious to be trusted there,—but cunningly hidden under the\r\ncurrant-bushes, on some dry stalks of last year’s grass. Hepzibah, on\r\nlearning the fact, took possession of the egg and appropriated it to\r\nClifford’s breakfast, on account of a certain delicacy of flavor, for\r\nwhich, as she affirmed, these eggs had always been famous. Thus unscrupulously\r\ndid the old gentlewoman sacrifice the continuance, perhaps, of an ancient\r\nfeathered race, with no better end than to supply her brother with a dainty\r\nthat hardly filled the bowl of a tea-spoon! It must have been in reference to\r\nthis outrage that Chanticleer, the next day, accompanied by the bereaved mother\r\nof the egg, took his post in front of Phœbe and Clifford, and delivered\r\nhimself of a harangue that might have proved as long as his own pedigree, but\r\nfor a fit of merriment on Phœbe’s part. Hereupon, the offended fowl\r\nstalked away on his long stilts, and utterly withdrew his notice from Phœbe\r\nand the rest of human nature, until she made her peace with an offering of\r\nspice-cake, which, next to snails, was the delicacy most in favor with his\r\naristocratic taste.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe linger too long, no doubt, beside this paltry rivulet of life that flowed\r\nthrough the garden of the Pyncheon House. But we deem it pardonable to record\r\nthese mean incidents and poor delights, because they proved so greatly to\r\nClifford’s benefit. They had the earth-smell in them, and contributed to\r\ngive him health and substance. Some of his occupations wrought less desirably\r\nupon him. He had a singular propensity, for example, to hang over Maule’s\r\nwell, and look at the constantly shifting phantasmagoria of figures produced by\r\nthe agitation of the water over the mosaic-work of colored pebbles at the\r\nbottom. He said that faces looked upward to him there,—beautiful faces,\r\narrayed in bewitching smiles,—each momentary face so fair and rosy, and\r\nevery smile so sunny, that he felt wronged at its departure, until the same\r\nflitting witchcraft made a new one. But sometimes he would suddenly cry out,\r\n“The dark face gazes at me!” and be miserable the whole day\r\nafterwards. Phœbe, when she hung over the fountain by Clifford’s side,\r\ncould see nothing of all this,—neither the beauty nor the\r\nugliness,—but only the colored pebbles, looking as if the gush of the\r\nwaters shook and disarranged them. And the dark face, that so troubled\r\nClifford, was no more than the shadow thrown from a branch of one of the\r\ndamson-trees, and breaking the inner light of Maule’s well. The truth\r\nwas, however, that his fancy—reviving faster than his will and judgment,\r\nand always stronger than they—created shapes of loveliness that were\r\nsymbolic of his native character, and now and then a stern and dreadful shape\r\nthat typified his fate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn Sundays, after Phœbe had been at church,—for the girl had a\r\nchurch-going conscience, and would hardly have been at ease had she missed\r\neither prayer, singing, sermon, or benediction,—after church-time,\r\ntherefore, there was, ordinarily, a sober little festival in the garden. In\r\naddition to Clifford, Hepzibah, and Phœbe, two guests made up the company. One\r\nwas the artist Holgrave, who, in spite of his consociation with reformers, and\r\nhis other queer and questionable traits, continued to hold an elevated place in\r\nHepzibah’s regard. The other, we are almost ashamed to say, was the\r\nvenerable Uncle Venner, in a clean shirt, and a broadcloth coat, more\r\nrespectable than his ordinary wear, inasmuch as it was neatly patched on each\r\nelbow, and might be called an entire garment, except for a slight inequality in\r\nthe length of its skirts. Clifford, on several occasions, had seemed to enjoy\r\nthe old man’s intercourse, for the sake of his mellow, cheerful vein,\r\nwhich was like the sweet flavor of a frost-bitten apple, such as one picks up\r\nunder the tree in December. A man at the very lowest point of the social scale\r\nwas easier and more agreeable for the fallen gentleman to encounter than a\r\nperson at any of the intermediate degrees; and, moreover, as Clifford’s\r\nyoung manhood had been lost, he was fond of feeling himself comparatively\r\nyouthful, now, in apposition with the patriarchal age of Uncle Venner. In fact,\r\nit was sometimes observable that Clifford half wilfully hid from himself the\r\nconsciousness of being stricken in years, and cherished visions of an earthly\r\nfuture still before him; visions, however, too indistinctly drawn to be\r\nfollowed by disappointment—though, doubtless, by depression—when\r\nany casual incident or recollection made him sensible of the withered leaf.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo this oddly composed little social party used to assemble under the ruinous\r\narbor. Hepzibah—stately as ever at heart, and yielding not an inch of her\r\nold gentility, but resting upon it so much the more, as justifying a\r\nprincess-like condescension—exhibited a not ungraceful hospitality. She\r\ntalked kindly to the vagrant artist, and took sage counsel—lady as she\r\nwas—with the wood-sawyer, the messenger of everybody’s petty\r\nerrands, the patched philosopher. And Uncle Venner, who had studied the world\r\nat street-corners, and other posts equally well adapted for just observation,\r\nwas as ready to give out his wisdom as a town-pump to give water.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Miss Hepzibah, ma’am,” said he once, after they had all been\r\ncheerful together, “I really enjoy these quiet little meetings of a\r\nSabbath afternoon. They are very much like what I expect to have after I retire\r\nto my farm!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Uncle Venner” observed Clifford in a drowsy, inward tone,\r\n“is always talking about his farm. But I have a better scheme for him, by\r\nand by. We shall see!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Mr. Clifford Pyncheon!” said the man of patches, “you\r\nmay scheme for me as much as you please; but I’m not going to give up\r\nthis one scheme of my own, even if I never bring it really to pass. It does\r\nseem to me that men make a wonderful mistake in trying to heap up property upon\r\nproperty. If I had done so, I should feel as if Providence was not bound to\r\ntake care of me; and, at all events, the city wouldn’t be! I’m one\r\nof those people who think that infinity is big enough for us all—and\r\neternity long enough.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, so they are, Uncle Venner,” remarked Phœbe after a pause;\r\nfor she had been trying to fathom the profundity and appositeness of this\r\nconcluding apothegm. “But for this short life of ours, one would like a\r\nhouse and a moderate garden-spot of one’s own.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It appears to me,” said the daguerreotypist, smiling, “that\r\nUncle Venner has the principles of Fourier at the bottom of his wisdom; only\r\nthey have not quite so much distinctness in his mind as in that of the\r\nsystematizing Frenchman.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, Phœbe,” said Hepzibah, “it is time to bring the\r\ncurrants.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then, while the yellow richness of the declining sunshine still fell into\r\nthe open space of the garden, Phœbe brought out a loaf of bread and a china\r\nbowl of currants, freshly gathered from the bushes, and crushed with sugar.\r\nThese, with water,—but not from the fountain of ill omen, close at\r\nhand,—constituted all the entertainment. Meanwhile, Holgrave took some\r\npains to establish an intercourse with Clifford, actuated, it might seem,\r\nentirely by an impulse of kindliness, in order that the present hour might be\r\ncheerfuller than most which the poor recluse had spent, or was destined yet to\r\nspend. Nevertheless, in the artist’s deep, thoughtful, all-observant\r\neyes, there was, now and then, an expression, not sinister, but questionable;\r\nas if he had some other interest in the scene than a stranger, a youthful and\r\nunconnected adventurer, might be supposed to have. With great mobility of\r\noutward mood, however, he applied himself to the task of enlivening the party;\r\nand with so much success, that even dark-hued Hepzibah threw off one tint of\r\nmelancholy, and made what shift she could with the remaining portion. Phœbe\r\nsaid to herself,—“How pleasant he can be!” As for Uncle\r\nVenner, as a mark of friendship and approbation, he readily consented to afford\r\nthe young man his countenance in the way of his profession,—not\r\nmetaphorically, be it understood, but literally, by allowing a daguerreotype of\r\nhis face, so familiar to the town, to be exhibited at the entrance of\r\nHolgrave’s studio.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford, as the company partook of their little banquet, grew to be the gayest\r\nof them all. Either it was one of those up-quivering flashes of the spirit, to\r\nwhich minds in an abnormal state are liable, or else the artist had subtly\r\ntouched some chord that made musical vibration. Indeed, what with the pleasant\r\nsummer evening, and the sympathy of this little circle of not unkindly souls,\r\nit was perhaps natural that a character so susceptible as Clifford’s\r\nshould become animated, and show itself readily responsive to what was said\r\naround him. But he gave out his own thoughts, likewise, with an airy and\r\nfanciful glow; so that they glistened, as it were, through the arbor, and made\r\ntheir escape among the interstices of the foliage. He had been as cheerful, no\r\ndoubt, while alone with Phœbe, but never with such tokens of acute, although\r\npartial intelligence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, as the sunlight left the peaks of the Seven Gables, so did the excitement\r\nfade out of Clifford’s eyes. He gazed vaguely and mournfully about him,\r\nas if he missed something precious, and missed it the more drearily for not\r\nknowing precisely what it was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want my happiness!” at last he murmured hoarsely and\r\nindistinctly, hardly shaping out the words. “Many, many years have I\r\nwaited for it! It is late! It is late! I want my happiness!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlas, poor Clifford! You are old, and worn with troubles that ought never to\r\nhave befallen you. You are partly crazy and partly imbecile; a ruin, a failure,\r\nas almost everybody is,—though some in less degree, or less perceptibly,\r\nthan their fellows. Fate has no happiness in store for you; unless your quiet\r\nhome in the old family residence with the faithful Hepzibah, and your long\r\nsummer afternoons with Phœbe, and these Sabbath festivals with Uncle Venner\r\nand the daguerreotypist, deserve to be called happiness! Why not? If not the\r\nthing itself, it is marvellously like it, and the more so for that ethereal and\r\nintangible quality which causes it all to vanish at too close an introspection.\r\nTake it, therefore, while you may. Murmur not,—question not,—but\r\nmake the most of it!\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap11\"></a>XI.<br>\r\nThe Arched Window</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the inertness, or what we may term the vegetative character, of his\r\nordinary mood, Clifford would perhaps have been content to spend one day after\r\nanother, interminably,—or, at least, throughout the summer-time,—in\r\njust the kind of life described in the preceding pages. Fancying, however, that\r\nit might be for his benefit occasionally to diversify the scene, Phœbe\r\nsometimes suggested that he should look out upon the life of the street. For\r\nthis purpose, they used to mount the staircase together, to the second story of\r\nthe house, where, at the termination of a wide entry, there was an arched\r\nwindow, of uncommonly large dimensions, shaded by a pair of curtains. It opened\r\nabove the porch, where there had formerly been a balcony, the balustrade of\r\nwhich had long since gone to decay, and been removed. At this arched window,\r\nthrowing it open, but keeping himself in comparative obscurity by means of the\r\ncurtain, Clifford had an opportunity of witnessing such a portion of the great\r\nworld’s movement as might be supposed to roll through one of the retired\r\nstreets of a not very populous city. But he and Phœbe made a sight as well\r\nworth seeing as any that the city could exhibit. The pale, gray, childish,\r\naged, melancholy, yet often simply cheerful, and sometimes delicately\r\nintelligent aspect of Clifford, peering from behind the faded crimson of the\r\ncurtain,—watching the monotony of every-day occurrences with a kind of\r\ninconsequential interest and earnestness, and, at every petty throb of his\r\nsensibility, turning for sympathy to the eyes of the bright young girl!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf once he were fairly seated at the window, even Pyncheon Street would hardly\r\nbe so dull and lonely but that, somewhere or other along its extent, Clifford\r\nmight discover matter to occupy his eye, and titillate, if not engross, his\r\nobservation. Things familiar to the youngest child that had begun its outlook\r\nat existence seemed strange to him. A cab; an omnibus, with its populous\r\ninterior, dropping here and there a passenger, and picking up another, and thus\r\ntypifying that vast rolling vehicle, the world, the end of whose journey is\r\neverywhere and nowhere; these objects he followed eagerly with his eyes, but\r\nforgot them before the dust raised by the horses and wheels had settled along\r\ntheir track. As regarded novelties (among which cabs and omnibuses were to be\r\nreckoned), his mind appeared to have lost its proper gripe and retentiveness.\r\nTwice or thrice, for example, during the sunny hours of the day, a water-cart\r\nwent along by the Pyncheon House, leaving a broad wake of moistened earth,\r\ninstead of the white dust that had risen at a lady’s lightest footfall;\r\nit was like a summer shower, which the city authorities had caught and tamed,\r\nand compelled it into the commonest routine of their convenience. With the\r\nwater-cart Clifford could never grow familiar; it always affected him with just\r\nthe same surprise as at first. His mind took an apparently sharp impression\r\nfrom it, but lost the recollection of this perambulatory shower, before its\r\nnext reappearance, as completely as did the street itself, along which the heat\r\nso quickly strewed white dust again. It was the same with the railroad.\r\nClifford could hear the obstreperous howl of the steam-devil, and, by leaning a\r\nlittle way from the arched window, could catch a glimpse of the trains of cars,\r\nflashing a brief transit across the extremity of the street. The idea of\r\nterrible energy thus forced upon him was new at every recurrence, and seemed to\r\naffect him as disagreeably, and with almost as much surprise, the hundredth\r\ntime as the first.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNothing gives a sadder sense of decay than this loss or suspension of the power\r\nto deal with unaccustomed things, and to keep up with the swiftness of the\r\npassing moment. It can merely be a suspended animation; for, were the power\r\nactually to perish, there would be little use of immortality. We are less than\r\nghosts, for the time being, whenever this calamity befalls us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford was indeed the most inveterate of conservatives. All the antique\r\nfashions of the street were dear to him; even such as were characterized by a\r\nrudeness that would naturally have annoyed his fastidious senses. He loved the\r\nold rumbling and jolting carts, the former track of which he still found in his\r\nlong-buried remembrance, as the observer of to-day finds the wheel-tracks of\r\nancient vehicles in Herculaneum. The butcher’s cart, with its snowy\r\ncanopy, was an acceptable object; so was the fish-cart, heralded by its horn;\r\nso, likewise, was the countryman’s cart of vegetables, plodding from door\r\nto door, with long pauses of the patient horse, while his owner drove a trade\r\nin turnips, carrots, summer-squashes, string-beans, green peas, and new\r\npotatoes, with half the housewives of the neighborhood. The baker’s cart,\r\nwith the harsh music of its bells, had a pleasant effect on Clifford, because,\r\nas few things else did, it jingled the very dissonance of yore. One afternoon a\r\nscissor-grinder chanced to set his wheel a-going under the Pyncheon Elm, and\r\njust in front of the arched window. Children came running with their\r\nmothers’ scissors, or the carving-knife, or the paternal razor, or\r\nanything else that lacked an edge (except, indeed, poor Clifford’s wits),\r\nthat the grinder might apply the article to his magic wheel, and give it back\r\nas good as new. Round went the busily revolving machinery, kept in motion by\r\nthe scissor-grinder’s foot, and wore away the hard steel against the hard\r\nstone, whence issued an intense and spiteful prolongation of a hiss as fierce\r\nas those emitted by Satan and his compeers in Pandemonium, though squeezed into\r\nsmaller compass. It was an ugly, little, venomous serpent of a noise, as ever\r\ndid petty violence to human ears. But Clifford listened with rapturous delight.\r\nThe sound, however disagreeable, had very brisk life in it, and, together with\r\nthe circle of curious children watching the revolutions of the wheel, appeared\r\nto give him a more vivid sense of active, bustling, and sunshiny existence than\r\nhe had attained in almost any other way. Nevertheless, its charm lay chiefly in\r\nthe past; for the scissor-grinder’s wheel had hissed in his childish\r\nears.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sometimes made doleful complaint that there were no stage-coaches nowadays.\r\nAnd he asked in an injured tone what had become of all those old square-topped\r\nchaises, with wings sticking out on either side, that used to be drawn by a\r\nplough-horse, and driven by a farmer’s wife and daughter, peddling\r\nwhortle-berries and blackberries about the town. Their disappearance made him\r\ndoubt, he said, whether the berries had not left off growing in the broad\r\npastures and along the shady country lanes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut anything that appealed to the sense of beauty, in however humble a way, did\r\nnot require to be recommended by these old associations. This was observable\r\nwhen one of those Italian boys (who are rather a modern feature of our streets)\r\ncame along with his barrel-organ, and stopped under the wide and cool shadows\r\nof the elm. With his quick professional eye he took note of the two faces\r\nwatching him from the arched window, and, opening his instrument, began to\r\nscatter its melodies abroad. He had a monkey on his shoulder, dressed in a\r\nHighland plaid; and, to complete the sum of splendid attractions wherewith he\r\npresented himself to the public, there was a company of little figures, whose\r\nsphere and habitation was in the mahogany case of his organ, and whose\r\nprinciple of life was the music which the Italian made it his business to grind\r\nout. In all their variety of occupation,—the cobbler, the blacksmith, the\r\nsoldier, the lady with her fan, the toper with his bottle, the milk-maid\r\nsitting by her cow—this fortunate little society might truly be said to\r\nenjoy a harmonious existence, and to make life literally a dance. The Italian\r\nturned a crank; and, behold! every one of these small individuals started into\r\nthe most curious vivacity. The cobbler wrought upon a shoe; the blacksmith\r\nhammered his iron, the soldier waved his glittering blade; the lady raised a\r\ntiny breeze with her fan; the jolly toper swigged lustily at his bottle; a\r\nscholar opened his book with eager thirst for knowledge, and turned his head to\r\nand fro along the page; the milkmaid energetically drained her cow; and a miser\r\ncounted gold into his strong-box,—all at the same turning of a crank.\r\nYes; and, moved by the self-same impulse, a lover saluted his mistress on her\r\nlips! Possibly some cynic, at once merry and bitter, had desired to signify, in\r\nthis pantomimic scene, that we mortals, whatever our business or\r\namusement,—however serious, however trifling,—all dance to one\r\nidentical tune, and, in spite of our ridiculous activity, bring nothing finally\r\nto pass. For the most remarkable aspect of the affair was, that, at the\r\ncessation of the music, everybody was petrified at once, from the most\r\nextravagant life into a dead torpor. Neither was the cobbler’s shoe\r\nfinished, nor the blacksmith’s iron shaped out; nor was there a drop less\r\nof brandy in the toper’s bottle, nor a drop more of milk in the\r\nmilkmaid’s pail, nor one additional coin in the miser’s strong-box,\r\nnor was the scholar a page deeper in his book. All were precisely in the same\r\ncondition as before they made themselves so ridiculous by their haste to toil,\r\nto enjoy, to accumulate gold, and to become wise. Saddest of all, moreover, the\r\nlover was none the happier for the maiden’s granted kiss! But, rather\r\nthan swallow this last too acrid ingredient, we reject the whole moral of the\r\nshow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe monkey, meanwhile, with a thick tail curling out into preposterous\r\nprolixity from beneath his tartans, took his station at the Italian’s\r\nfeet. He turned a wrinkled and abominable little visage to every passer-by, and\r\nto the circle of children that soon gathered round, and to Hepzibah’s\r\nshop-door, and upward to the arched window, whence Phœbe and Clifford were\r\nlooking down. Every moment, also, he took off his Highland bonnet, and\r\nperformed a bow and scrape. Sometimes, moreover, he made personal application\r\nto individuals, holding out his small black palm, and otherwise plainly\r\nsignifying his excessive desire for whatever filthy lucre might happen to be in\r\nanybody’s pocket. The mean and low, yet strangely man-like expression of\r\nhis wilted countenance; the prying and crafty glance, that showed him ready to\r\ngripe at every miserable advantage; his enormous tail (too enormous to be\r\ndecently concealed under his gabardine), and the deviltry of nature which it\r\nbetokened,—take this monkey just as he was, in short, and you could\r\ndesire no better image of the Mammon of copper coin, symbolizing the grossest\r\nform of the love of money. Neither was there any possibility of satisfying the\r\ncovetous little devil. Phœbe threw down a whole handful of cents, which he\r\npicked up with joyless eagerness, handed them over to the Italian for\r\nsafekeeping, and immediately recommenced a series of pantomimic petitions for\r\nmore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDoubtless, more than one New-Englander—or, let him be of what country he\r\nmight, it is as likely to be the case—passed by, and threw a look at the\r\nmonkey, and went on, without imagining how nearly his own moral condition was\r\nhere exemplified. Clifford, however, was a being of another order. He had taken\r\nchildish delight in the music, and smiled, too, at the figures which it set in\r\nmotion. But, after looking awhile at the long-tailed imp, he was so shocked by\r\nhis horrible ugliness, spiritual as well as physical, that he actually began to\r\nshed tears; a weakness which men of merely delicate endowments, and destitute\r\nof the fiercer, deeper, and more tragic power of laughter, can hardly avoid,\r\nwhen the worst and meanest aspect of life happens to be presented to them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPyncheon Street was sometimes enlivened by spectacles of more imposing\r\npretensions than the above, and which brought the multitude along with them.\r\nWith a shivering repugnance at the idea of personal contact with the world, a\r\npowerful impulse still seized on Clifford, whenever the rush and roar of the\r\nhuman tide grew strongly audible to him. This was made evident, one day, when a\r\npolitical procession, with hundreds of flaunting banners, and drums, fifes,\r\nclarions, and cymbals, reverberating between the rows of buildings, marched all\r\nthrough town, and trailed its length of trampling footsteps, and most\r\ninfrequent uproar, past the ordinarily quiet House of the Seven Gables. As a\r\nmere object of sight, nothing is more deficient in picturesque features than a\r\nprocession seen in its passage through narrow streets. The spectator feels it\r\nto be fool’s play, when he can distinguish the tedious commonplace of\r\neach man’s visage, with the perspiration and weary self-importance on it,\r\nand the very cut of his pantaloons, and the stiffness or laxity of his\r\nshirt-collar, and the dust on the back of his black coat. In order to become\r\nmajestic, it should be viewed from some vantage point, as it rolls its slow and\r\nlong array through the centre of a wide plain, or the stateliest public square\r\nof a city; for then, by its remoteness, it melts all the petty personalities,\r\nof which it is made up, into one broad mass of existence,—one great\r\nlife,—one collected body of mankind, with a vast, homogeneous spirit\r\nanimating it. But, on the other hand, if an impressible person, standing alone\r\nover the brink of one of these processions, should behold it, not in its atoms,\r\nbut in its aggregate,—as a mighty river of life, massive in its tide, and\r\nblack with mystery, and, out of its depths, calling to the kindred depth within\r\nhim,—then the contiguity would add to the effect. It might so fascinate\r\nhim that he would hardly be restrained from plunging into the surging stream of\r\nhuman sympathies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo it proved with Clifford. He shuddered; he grew pale; he threw an appealing\r\nlook at Hepzibah and Phœbe, who were with him at the window. They comprehended\r\nnothing of his emotions, and supposed him merely disturbed by the unaccustomed\r\ntumult. At last, with tremulous limbs, he started up, set his foot on the\r\nwindow-sill, and in an instant more would have been in the unguarded balcony.\r\nAs it was, the whole procession might have seen him, a wild, haggard figure,\r\nhis gray locks floating in the wind that waved their banners; a lonely being,\r\nestranged from his race, but now feeling himself man again, by virtue of the\r\nirrepressible instinct that possessed him. Had Clifford attained the balcony,\r\nhe would probably have leaped into the street; but whether impelled by the\r\nspecies of terror that sometimes urges its victim over the very precipice which\r\nhe shrinks from, or by a natural magnetism, tending towards the great centre of\r\nhumanity, it were not easy to decide. Both impulses might have wrought on him\r\nat once.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut his companions, affrighted by his gesture,—which was that of a man\r\nhurried away in spite of himself,—seized Clifford’s garment and\r\nheld him back. Hepzibah shrieked. Phœbe, to whom all extravagance was a\r\nhorror, burst into sobs and tears.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford, Clifford! are you crazy?” cried his sister.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hardly know, Hepzibah,” said Clifford, drawing a long breath.\r\n“Fear nothing,—it is over now,—but had I taken that plunge,\r\nand survived it, methinks it would have made me another man!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPossibly, in some sense, Clifford may have been right. He needed a shock; or\r\nperhaps he required to take a deep, deep plunge into the ocean of human life,\r\nand to sink down and be covered by its profoundness, and then to emerge,\r\nsobered, invigorated, restored to the world and to himself. Perhaps again, he\r\nrequired nothing less than the great final remedy—death!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA similar yearning to renew the broken links of brotherhood with his kind\r\nsometimes showed itself in a milder form; and once it was made beautiful by the\r\nreligion that lay even deeper than itself. In the incident now to be sketched,\r\nthere was a touching recognition, on Clifford’s part, of God’s care\r\nand love towards him,—towards this poor, forsaken man, who, if any mortal\r\ncould, might have been pardoned for regarding himself as thrown aside,\r\nforgotten, and left to be the sport of some fiend, whose playfulness was an\r\necstasy of mischief.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was the Sabbath morning; one of those bright, calm Sabbaths, with its own\r\nhallowed atmosphere, when Heaven seems to diffuse itself over the earth’s\r\nface in a solemn smile, no less sweet than solemn. On such a Sabbath morn, were\r\nwe pure enough to be its medium, we should be conscious of the earth’s\r\nnatural worship ascending through our frames, on whatever spot of ground we\r\nstood. The church-bells, with various tones, but all in harmony, were calling\r\nout and responding to one another,—“It is the Sabbath!—The\r\nSabbath!—Yea; the Sabbath!”—and over the whole city the bells\r\nscattered the blessed sounds, now slowly, now with livelier joy, now one bell\r\nalone, now all the bells together, crying earnestly,—“It is the\r\nSabbath!”—and flinging their accents afar off, to melt into the air\r\nand pervade it with the holy word. The air with God’s sweetest and\r\ntenderest sunshine in it, was meet for mankind to breathe into their hearts,\r\nand send it forth again as the utterance of prayer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford sat at the window with Hepzibah, watching the neighbors as they\r\nstepped into the street. All of them, however unspiritual on other days, were\r\ntransfigured by the Sabbath influence; so that their very\r\ngarments—whether it were an old man’s decent coat well brushed for\r\nthe thousandth time, or a little boy’s first sack and trousers finished\r\nyesterday by his mother’s needle—had somewhat of the quality of\r\nascension-robes. Forth, likewise, from the portal of the old house stepped\r\nPhœbe, putting up her small green sunshade, and throwing upward a glance and\r\nsmile of parting kindness to the faces at the arched window. In her aspect\r\nthere was a familiar gladness, and a holiness that you could play with, and yet\r\nreverence it as much as ever. She was like a prayer, offered up in the\r\nhomeliest beauty of one’s mother-tongue. Fresh was Phœbe, moreover, and\r\nairy and sweet in her apparel; as if nothing that she wore—neither her\r\ngown, nor her small straw bonnet, nor her little kerchief, any more than her\r\nsnowy stockings—had ever been put on before; or, if worn, were all the\r\nfresher for it, and with a fragrance as if they had lain among the rosebuds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl waved her hand to Hepzibah and Clifford, and went up the street; a\r\nreligion in herself, warm, simple, true, with a substance that could walk on\r\nearth, and a spirit that was capable of heaven.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hepzibah,” asked Clifford, after watching Phœbe to the corner,\r\n“do you never go to church?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, Clifford!” she replied,—“not these many, many\r\nyears!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Were I to be there,” he rejoined, “it seems to me that I\r\ncould pray once more, when so many human souls were praying all around\r\nme!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked into Clifford’s face, and beheld there a soft natural\r\neffusion; for his heart gushed out, as it were, and ran over at his eyes, in\r\ndelightful reverence for God, and kindly affection for his human brethren. The\r\nemotion communicated itself to Hepzibah. She yearned to take him by the hand,\r\nand go and kneel down, they two together,—both so long separate from the\r\nworld, and, as she now recognized, scarcely friends with Him above,—to\r\nkneel down among the people, and be reconciled to God and man at once.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear brother,” said she earnestly, “let us go! We belong\r\nnowhere. We have not a foot of space in any church to kneel upon; but let us go\r\nto some place of worship, even if we stand in the broad aisle. Poor and\r\nforsaken as we are, some pew-door will be opened to us!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo Hepzibah and her brother made themselves, ready—as ready as they could\r\nin the best of their old-fashioned garments, which had hung on pegs, or been\r\nlaid away in trunks, so long that the dampness and mouldy smell of the past was\r\non them,—made themselves ready, in their faded bettermost, to go to\r\nchurch. They descended the staircase together,—gaunt, sallow Hepzibah,\r\nand pale, emaciated, age-stricken Clifford! They pulled open the front door,\r\nand stepped across the threshold, and felt, both of them, as if they were\r\nstanding in the presence of the whole world, and with mankind’s great and\r\nterrible eye on them alone. The eye of their Father seemed to be withdrawn, and\r\ngave them no encouragement. The warm sunny air of the street made them shiver.\r\nTheir hearts quaked within them at the idea of taking one step farther.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It cannot be, Hepzibah!—it is too late,” said Clifford with\r\ndeep sadness. “We are ghosts! We have no right among human\r\nbeings,—no right anywhere but in this old house, which has a curse on it,\r\nand which, therefore, we are doomed to haunt! And, besides,” he\r\ncontinued, with a fastidious sensibility, inalienably characteristic of the\r\nman, “it would not be fit nor beautiful to go! It is an ugly thought that\r\nI should be frightful to my fellow-beings, and that children would cling to\r\ntheir mothers’ gowns at sight of me!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey shrank back into the dusky passage-way, and closed the door. But, going up\r\nthe staircase again, they found the whole interior of the house tenfold more\r\ndismal, and the air closer and heavier, for the glimpse and breath of freedom\r\nwhich they had just snatched. They could not flee; their jailer had but left\r\nthe door ajar in mockery, and stood behind it to watch them stealing out. At\r\nthe threshold, they felt his pitiless gripe upon them. For, what other dungeon\r\nis so dark as one’s own heart! What jailer so inexorable as one’s\r\nself!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it would be no fair picture of Clifford’s state of mind were we to\r\nrepresent him as continually or prevailingly wretched. On the contrary, there\r\nwas no other man in the city, we are bold to affirm, of so much as half his\r\nyears, who enjoyed so many lightsome and griefless moments as himself. He had\r\nno burden of care upon him; there were none of those questions and\r\ncontingencies with the future to be settled which wear away all other lives,\r\nand render them not worth having by the very process of providing for their\r\nsupport. In this respect he was a child,—a child for the whole term of\r\nhis existence, be it long or short. Indeed, his life seemed to be standing\r\nstill at a period little in advance of childhood, and to cluster all his\r\nreminiscences about that epoch; just as, after the torpor of a heavy blow, the\r\nsufferer’s reviving consciousness goes back to a moment considerably\r\nbehind the accident that stupefied him. He sometimes told Phœbe and Hepzibah\r\nhis dreams, in which he invariably played the part of a child, or a very young\r\nman. So vivid were they, in his relation of them, that he once held a dispute\r\nwith his sister as to the particular figure or print of a chintz morning-dress\r\nwhich he had seen their mother wear, in the dream of the preceding night.\r\nHepzibah, piquing herself on a woman’s accuracy in such matters, held it\r\nto be slightly different from what Clifford described; but, producing the very\r\ngown from an old trunk, it proved to be identical with his remembrance of it.\r\nHad Clifford, every time that he emerged out of dreams so lifelike, undergone\r\nthe torture of transformation from a boy into an old and broken man, the daily\r\nrecurrence of the shock would have been too much to bear. It would have caused\r\nan acute agony to thrill from the morning twilight, all the day through, until\r\nbedtime; and even then would have mingled a dull, inscrutable pain and pallid\r\nhue of misfortune with the visionary bloom and adolescence of his slumber. But\r\nthe nightly moonshine interwove itself with the morning mist, and enveloped him\r\nas in a robe, which he hugged about his person, and seldom let realities pierce\r\nthrough; he was not often quite awake, but slept open-eyed, and perhaps fancied\r\nhimself most dreaming then.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus, lingering always so near his childhood, he had sympathies with children,\r\nand kept his heart the fresher thereby, like a reservoir into which rivulets\r\nwere pouring not far from the fountain-head. Though prevented, by a subtile\r\nsense of propriety, from desiring to associate with them, he loved few things\r\nbetter than to look out of the arched window and see a little girl driving her\r\nhoop along the sidewalk, or schoolboys at a game of ball. Their voices, also,\r\nwere very pleasant to him, heard at a distance, all swarming and intermingling\r\ntogether as flies do in a sunny room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford would, doubtless, have been glad to share their sports. One afternoon\r\nhe was seized with an irresistible desire to blow soap-bubbles; an amusement,\r\nas Hepzibah told Phœbe apart, that had been a favorite one with her brother\r\nwhen they were both children. Behold him, therefore, at the arched window, with\r\nan earthen pipe in his mouth! Behold him, with his gray hair, and a wan, unreal\r\nsmile over his countenance, where still hovered a beautiful grace, which his\r\nworst enemy must have acknowledged to be spiritual and immortal, since it had\r\nsurvived so long! Behold him, scattering airy spheres abroad from the window\r\ninto the street! Little impalpable worlds were those soap-bubbles, with the big\r\nworld depicted, in hues bright as imagination, on the nothing of their surface.\r\nIt was curious to see how the passers-by regarded these brilliant fantasies, as\r\nthey came floating down, and made the dull atmosphere imaginative about them.\r\nSome stopped to gaze, and perhaps, carried a pleasant recollection of the\r\nbubbles onward as far as the street-corner; some looked angrily upward, as if\r\npoor Clifford wronged them by setting an image of beauty afloat so near their\r\ndusty pathway. A great many put out their fingers or their walking-sticks to\r\ntouch, withal; and were perversely gratified, no doubt, when the bubble, with\r\nall its pictured earth and sky scene, vanished as if it had never been.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt length, just as an elderly gentleman of very dignified presence happened to\r\nbe passing, a large bubble sailed majestically down, and burst right against\r\nhis nose! He looked up,—at first with a stern, keen glance, which\r\npenetrated at once into the obscurity behind the arched window,—then with\r\na smile which might be conceived as diffusing a dog-day sultriness for the\r\nspace of several yards about him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Aha, Cousin Clifford!” cried Judge Pyncheon. “What! Still\r\nblowing soap-bubbles!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tone seemed as if meant to be kind and soothing, but yet had a bitterness\r\nof sarcasm in it. As for Clifford, an absolute palsy of fear came over him.\r\nApart from any definite cause of dread which his past experience might have\r\ngiven him, he felt that native and original horror of the excellent Judge which\r\nis proper to a weak, delicate, and apprehensive character in the presence of\r\nmassive strength. Strength is incomprehensible by weakness, and, therefore, the\r\nmore terrible. There is no greater bugbear than a strong-willed relative in the\r\ncircle of his own connections.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap12\"></a>XII.<br>\r\nThe Daguerreotypist</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt must not be supposed that the life of a personage naturally so active as\r\nPhœbe could be wholly confined within the precincts of the old Pyncheon House.\r\nClifford’s demands upon her time were usually satisfied, in those long\r\ndays, considerably earlier than sunset. Quiet as his daily existence seemed, it\r\nnevertheless drained all the resources by which he lived. It was not physical\r\nexercise that overwearied him,—for except that he sometimes wrought a\r\nlittle with a hoe, or paced the garden-walk, or, in rainy weather, traversed a\r\nlarge unoccupied room,—it was his tendency to remain only too quiescent,\r\nas regarded any toil of the limbs and muscles. But, either there was a\r\nsmouldering fire within him that consumed his vital energy, or the monotony\r\nthat would have dragged itself with benumbing effect over a mind differently\r\nsituated was no monotony to Clifford. Possibly, he was in a state of second\r\ngrowth and recovery, and was constantly assimilating nutriment for his spirit\r\nand intellect from sights, sounds, and events which passed as a perfect void to\r\npersons more practised with the world. As all is activity and vicissitude to\r\nthe new mind of a child, so might it be, likewise, to a mind that had undergone\r\na kind of new creation, after its long-suspended life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBe the cause what it might, Clifford commonly retired to rest, thoroughly\r\nexhausted, while the sunbeams were still melting through his window-curtains,\r\nor were thrown with late lustre on the chamber wall. And while he thus slept\r\nearly, as other children do, and dreamed of childhood, Phœbe was free to\r\nfollow her own tastes for the remainder of the day and evening.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a freedom essential to the health even of a character so little\r\nsusceptible of morbid influences as that of Phœbe. The old house, as we have\r\nalready said, had both the dry-rot and the damp-rot in its walls; it was not\r\ngood to breathe no other atmosphere than that. Hepzibah, though she had her\r\nvaluable and redeeming traits, had grown to be a kind of lunatic by imprisoning\r\nherself so long in one place, with no other company than a single series of\r\nideas, and but one affection, and one bitter sense of wrong. Clifford, the\r\nreader may perhaps imagine, was too inert to operate morally on his\r\nfellow-creatures, however intimate and exclusive their relations with him. But\r\nthe sympathy or magnetism among human beings is more subtile and universal than\r\nwe think; it exists, indeed, among different classes of organized life, and\r\nvibrates from one to another. A flower, for instance, as Phœbe herself\r\nobserved, always began to droop sooner in Clifford’s hand, or\r\nHepzibah’s, than in her own; and by the same law, converting her whole\r\ndaily life into a flower fragrance for these two sickly spirits, the blooming\r\ngirl must inevitably droop and fade much sooner than if worn on a younger and\r\nhappier breast. Unless she had now and then indulged her brisk impulses, and\r\nbreathed rural air in a suburban walk, or ocean breezes along the\r\nshore,—had occasionally obeyed the impulse of Nature, in New England\r\ngirls, by attending a metaphysical or philosophical lecture, or viewing a\r\nseven-mile panorama, or listening to a concert,—had gone shopping about\r\nthe city, ransacking entire depots of splendid merchandise, and bringing home a\r\nribbon,—had employed, likewise, a little time to read the Bible in her\r\nchamber, and had stolen a little more to think of her mother and her native\r\nplace—unless for such moral medicines as the above, we should soon have\r\nbeheld our poor Phœbe grow thin and put on a bleached, unwholesome aspect, and\r\nassume strange, shy ways, prophetic of old-maidenhood and a cheerless future.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven as it was, a change grew visible; a change partly to be regretted,\r\nalthough whatever charm it infringed upon was repaired by another, perhaps more\r\nprecious. She was not so constantly gay, but had her moods of thought, which\r\nClifford, on the whole, liked better than her former phase of unmingled\r\ncheerfulness; because now she understood him better and more delicately, and\r\nsometimes even interpreted him to himself. Her eyes looked larger, and darker,\r\nand deeper; so deep, at some silent moments, that they seemed like Artesian\r\nwells, down, down, into the infinite. She was less girlish than when we first\r\nbeheld her alighting from the omnibus; less girlish, but more a woman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe only youthful mind with which Phœbe had an opportunity of frequent\r\nintercourse was that of the daguerreotypist. Inevitably, by the pressure of the\r\nseclusion about them, they had been brought into habits of some familiarity.\r\nHad they met under different circumstances, neither of these young persons\r\nwould have been likely to bestow much thought upon the other, unless, indeed,\r\ntheir extreme dissimilarity should have proved a principle of mutual\r\nattraction. Both, it is true, were characters proper to New England life, and\r\npossessing a common ground, therefore, in their more external developments; but\r\nas unlike, in their respective interiors, as if their native climes had been at\r\nworld-wide distance. During the early part of their acquaintance, Phœbe had\r\nheld back rather more than was customary with her frank and simple manners from\r\nHolgrave’s not very marked advances. Nor was she yet satisfied that she\r\nknew him well, although they almost daily met and talked together, in a kind,\r\nfriendly, and what seemed to be a familiar way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe artist, in a desultory manner, had imparted to Phœbe something of his\r\nhistory. Young as he was, and had his career terminated at the point already\r\nattained, there had been enough of incident to fill, very creditably, an\r\nautobiographic volume. A romance on the plan of Gil Blas, adapted to American\r\nsociety and manners, would cease to be a romance. The experience of many\r\nindividuals among us, who think it hardly worth the telling, would equal the\r\nvicissitudes of the Spaniard’s earlier life; while their ultimate\r\nsuccess, or the point whither they tend, may be incomparably higher than any\r\nthat a novelist would imagine for his hero. Holgrave, as he told Phœbe\r\nsomewhat proudly, could not boast of his origin, unless as being exceedingly\r\nhumble, nor of his education, except that it had been the scantiest possible,\r\nand obtained by a few winter-months’ attendance at a district school.\r\nLeft early to his own guidance, he had begun to be self-dependent while yet a\r\nboy; and it was a condition aptly suited to his natural force of will. Though\r\nnow but twenty-two years old (lacking some months, which are years in such a\r\nlife), he had already been, first, a country schoolmaster; next, a salesman in\r\na country store; and, either at the same time or afterwards, the political\r\neditor of a country newspaper. He had subsequently travelled New England and\r\nthe Middle States, as a peddler, in the employment of a Connecticut manufactory\r\nof cologne-water and other essences. In an episodical way he had studied and\r\npractised dentistry, and with very flattering success, especially in many of\r\nthe factory-towns along our inland streams. As a supernumerary official, of\r\nsome kind or other, aboard a packet-ship, he had visited Europe, and found\r\nmeans, before his return, to see Italy, and part of France and Germany. At a\r\nlater period he had spent some months in a community of Fourierists. Still more\r\nrecently he had been a public lecturer on Mesmerism, for which science (as he\r\nassured Phœbe, and, indeed, satisfactorily proved, by putting Chanticleer, who\r\nhappened to be scratching near by, to sleep) he had very remarkable endowments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis present phase, as a daguerreotypist, was of no more importance in his own\r\nview, nor likely to be more permanent, than any of the preceding ones. It had\r\nbeen taken up with the careless alacrity of an adventurer, who had his bread to\r\nearn. It would be thrown aside as carelessly, whenever he should choose to earn\r\nhis bread by some other equally digressive means. But what was most remarkable,\r\nand, perhaps, showed a more than common poise in the young man, was the fact\r\nthat, amid all these personal vicissitudes, he had never lost his identity.\r\nHomeless as he had been,—continually changing his whereabout, and,\r\ntherefore, responsible neither to public opinion nor to\r\nindividuals,—putting off one exterior, and snatching up another, to be\r\nsoon shifted for a third,—he had never violated the innermost man, but\r\nhad carried his conscience along with him. It was impossible to know Holgrave\r\nwithout recognizing this to be the fact. Hepzibah had seen it. Phœbe soon saw\r\nit likewise, and gave him the sort of confidence which such a certainty\r\ninspires. She was startled, however, and sometimes repelled,—not by any\r\ndoubt of his integrity to whatever law he acknowledged, but by a sense that his\r\nlaw differed from her own. He made her uneasy, and seemed to unsettle\r\neverything around her, by his lack of reverence for what was fixed, unless, at\r\na moment’s warning, it could establish its right to hold its ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen, moreover, she scarcely thought him affectionate in his nature. He was too\r\ncalm and cool an observer. Phœbe felt his eye, often; his heart, seldom or\r\nnever. He took a certain kind of interest in Hepzibah and her brother, and\r\nPhœbe herself. He studied them attentively, and allowed no slightest\r\ncircumstance of their individualities to escape him. He was ready to do them\r\nwhatever good he might; but, after all, he never exactly made common cause with\r\nthem, nor gave any reliable evidence that he loved them better in proportion as\r\nhe knew them more. In his relations with them, he seemed to be in quest of\r\nmental food, not heart-sustenance. Phœbe could not conceive what interested\r\nhim so much in her friends and herself, intellectually, since he cared nothing\r\nfor them, or, comparatively, so little, as objects of human affection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlways, in his interviews with Phœbe, the artist made especial inquiry as to\r\nthe welfare of Clifford, whom, except at the Sunday festival, he seldom saw.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Does he still seem happy?” he asked one day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As happy as a child,” answered Phœbe; “but—like a\r\nchild, too—very easily disturbed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How disturbed?” inquired Holgrave. “By things without, or by\r\nthoughts within?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I cannot see his thoughts! How should I?” replied Phœbe with\r\nsimple piquancy. “Very often his humor changes without any reason that\r\ncan be guessed at, just as a cloud comes over the sun. Latterly, since I have\r\nbegun to know him better, I feel it to be not quite right to look closely into\r\nhis moods. He has had such a great sorrow, that his heart is made all solemn\r\nand sacred by it. When he is cheerful,—when the sun shines into his\r\nmind,—then I venture to peep in, just as far as the light reaches, but no\r\nfurther. It is holy ground where the shadow falls!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How prettily you express this sentiment!” said the artist.\r\n“I can understand the feeling, without possessing it. Had I your\r\nopportunities, no scruples would prevent me from fathoming Clifford to the full\r\ndepth of my plummet-line!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How strange that you should wish it!” remarked Phœbe\r\ninvoluntarily. “What is Cousin Clifford to you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, nothing,—of course, nothing!” answered Holgrave with a\r\nsmile. “Only this is such an odd and incomprehensible world! The more I\r\nlook at it, the more it puzzles me, and I begin to suspect that a man’s\r\nbewilderment is the measure of his wisdom. Men and women, and children, too,\r\nare such strange creatures, that one never can be certain that he really knows\r\nthem; nor ever guess what they have been from what he sees them to be now.\r\nJudge Pyncheon! Clifford! What a complex riddle—a complexity of\r\ncomplexities—do they present! It requires intuitive sympathy, like a\r\nyoung girl’s, to solve it. A mere observer, like myself (who never have\r\nany intuitions, and am, at best, only subtile and acute), is pretty certain to\r\ngo astray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe artist now turned the conversation to themes less dark than that which they\r\nhad touched upon. Phœbe and he were young together; nor had Holgrave, in his\r\npremature experience of life, wasted entirely that beautiful spirit of youth,\r\nwhich, gushing forth from one small heart and fancy, may diffuse itself over\r\nthe universe, making it all as bright as on the first day of creation.\r\nMan’s own youth is the world’s youth; at least, he feels as if it\r\nwere, and imagines that the earth’s granite substance is something not\r\nyet hardened, and which he can mould into whatever shape he likes. So it was\r\nwith Holgrave. He could talk sagely about the world’s old age, but never\r\nactually believed what he said; he was a young man still, and therefore looked\r\nupon the world—that gray-bearded and wrinkled profligate, decrepit,\r\nwithout being venerable—as a tender stripling, capable of being improved\r\ninto all that it ought to be, but scarcely yet had shown the remotest promise\r\nof becoming. He had that sense, or inward prophecy,—which a young man had\r\nbetter never have been born than not to have, and a mature man had better die\r\nat once than utterly to relinquish,—that we are not doomed to creep on\r\nforever in the old bad way, but that, this very now, there are the harbingers\r\nabroad of a golden era, to be accomplished in his own lifetime. It seemed to\r\nHolgrave,—as doubtless it has seemed to the hopeful of every century\r\nsince the epoch of Adam’s grandchildren,—that in this age, more\r\nthan ever before, the moss-grown and rotten Past is to be torn down, and\r\nlifeless institutions to be thrust out of the way, and their dead corpses\r\nburied, and everything to begin anew.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs to the main point,—may we never live to doubt it!—as to the\r\nbetter centuries that are coming, the artist was surely right. His error lay in\r\nsupposing that this age, more than any past or future one, is destined to see\r\nthe tattered garments of Antiquity exchanged for a new suit, instead of\r\ngradually renewing themselves by patchwork; in applying his own little\r\nlife-span as the measure of an interminable achievement; and, more than all, in\r\nfancying that it mattered anything to the great end in view whether he himself\r\nshould contend for it or against it. Yet it was well for him to think so. This\r\nenthusiasm, infusing itself through the calmness of his character, and thus\r\ntaking an aspect of settled thought and wisdom, would serve to keep his youth\r\npure, and make his aspirations high. And when, with the years settling down\r\nmore weightily upon him, his early faith should be modified by inevitable\r\nexperience, it would be with no harsh and sudden revolution of his sentiments.\r\nHe would still have faith in man’s brightening destiny, and perhaps love\r\nhim all the better, as he should recognize his helplessness in his own behalf;\r\nand the haughty faith, with which he began life, would be well bartered for a\r\nfar humbler one at its close, in discerning that man’s best directed\r\neffort accomplishes a kind of dream, while God is the sole worker of realities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHolgrave had read very little, and that little in passing through the\r\nthoroughfare of life, where the mystic language of his books was necessarily\r\nmixed up with the babble of the multitude, so that both one and the other were\r\napt to lose any sense that might have been properly their own. He considered\r\nhimself a thinker, and was certainly of a thoughtful turn, but, with his own\r\npath to discover, had perhaps hardly yet reached the point where an educated\r\nman begins to think. The true value of his character lay in that deep\r\nconsciousness of inward strength, which made all his past vicissitudes seem\r\nmerely like a change of garments; in that enthusiasm, so quiet that he scarcely\r\nknew of its existence, but which gave a warmth to everything that he laid his\r\nhand on; in that personal ambition, hidden—from his own as well as other\r\neyes—among his more generous impulses, but in which lurked a certain\r\nefficacy, that might solidify him from a theorist into the champion of some\r\npracticable cause. Altogether in his culture and want of culture,—in his\r\ncrude, wild, and misty philosophy, and the practical experience that\r\ncounteracted some of its tendencies; in his magnanimous zeal for man’s\r\nwelfare, and his recklessness of whatever the ages had established in\r\nman’s behalf; in his faith, and in his infidelity; in what he had, and in\r\nwhat he lacked,—the artist might fitly enough stand forth as the\r\nrepresentative of many compeers in his native land.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis career it would be difficult to prefigure. There appeared to be qualities\r\nin Holgrave, such as, in a country where everything is free to the hand that\r\ncan grasp it, could hardly fail to put some of the world’s prizes within\r\nhis reach. But these matters are delightfully uncertain. At almost every step\r\nin life, we meet with young men of just about Holgrave’s age, for whom we\r\nanticipate wonderful things, but of whom, even after much and careful inquiry,\r\nwe never happen to hear another word. The effervescence of youth and passion,\r\nand the fresh gloss of the intellect and imagination, endow them with a false\r\nbrilliancy, which makes fools of themselves and other people. Like certain\r\nchintzes, calicoes, and ginghams, they show finely in their first newness, but\r\ncannot stand the sun and rain, and assume a very sober aspect after\r\nwashing-day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut our business is with Holgrave as we find him on this particular afternoon,\r\nand in the arbor of the Pyncheon garden. In that point of view, it was a\r\npleasant sight to behold this young man, with so much faith in himself, and so\r\nfair an appearance of admirable powers,—so little harmed, too, by the\r\nmany tests that had tried his metal,—it was pleasant to see him in his\r\nkindly intercourse with Phœbe. Her thought had scarcely done him justice when\r\nit pronounced him cold; or, if so, he had grown warmer now. Without such\r\npurpose on her part, and unconsciously on his, she made the House of the Seven\r\nGables like a home to him, and the garden a familiar precinct. With the insight\r\non which he prided himself, he fancied that he could look through Phœbe, and\r\nall around her, and could read her off like a page of a child’s\r\nstory-book. But these transparent natures are often deceptive in their depth;\r\nthose pebbles at the bottom of the fountain are farther from us than we think.\r\nThus the artist, whatever he might judge of Phœbe’s capacity, was\r\nbeguiled, by some silent charm of hers, to talk freely of what he dreamed of\r\ndoing in the world. He poured himself out as to another self. Very possibly, he\r\nforgot Phœbe while he talked to her, and was moved only by the inevitable\r\ntendency of thought, when rendered sympathetic by enthusiasm and emotion, to\r\nflow into the first safe reservoir which it finds. But, had you peeped at them\r\nthrough the chinks of the garden-fence, the young man’s earnestness and\r\nheightened color might have led you to suppose that he was making love to the\r\nyoung girl!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt length, something was said by Holgrave that made it apposite for Phœbe to\r\ninquire what had first brought him acquainted with her cousin Hepzibah, and why\r\nhe now chose to lodge in the desolate old Pyncheon House. Without directly\r\nanswering her, he turned from the Future, which had heretofore been the theme\r\nof his discourse, and began to speak of the influences of the Past. One\r\nsubject, indeed, is but the reverberation of the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shall we never, never get rid of this Past?” cried he, keeping up\r\nthe earnest tone of his preceding conversation. “It lies upon the Present\r\nlike a giant’s dead body! In fact, the case is just as if a young giant\r\nwere compelled to waste all his strength in carrying about the corpse of the\r\nold giant, his grandfather, who died a long while ago, and only needs to be\r\ndecently buried. Just think a moment, and it will startle you to see what\r\nslaves we are to bygone times,—to Death, if we give the matter the right\r\nword!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I do not see it,” observed Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For example, then,” continued Holgrave: “a dead man, if he\r\nhappens to have made a will, disposes of wealth no longer his own; or, if he\r\ndie intestate, it is distributed in accordance with the notions of men much\r\nlonger dead than he. A dead man sits on all our judgment-seats; and living\r\njudges do but search out and repeat his decisions. We read in dead men’s\r\nbooks! We laugh at dead men’s jokes, and cry at dead men’s pathos!\r\nWe are sick of dead men’s diseases, physical and moral, and die of the\r\nsame remedies with which dead doctors killed their patients! We worship the\r\nliving Deity according to dead men’s forms and creeds. Whatever we seek\r\nto do, of our own free motion, a dead man’s icy hand obstructs us! Turn\r\nour eyes to what point we may, a dead man’s white, immitigable face\r\nencounters them, and freezes our very heart! And we must be dead ourselves\r\nbefore we can begin to have our proper influence on our own world, which will\r\nthen be no longer our world, but the world of another generation, with which we\r\nshall have no shadow of a right to interfere. I ought to have said, too, that\r\nwe live in dead men’s houses; as, for instance, in this of the Seven\r\nGables!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And why not,” said Phœbe, “so long as we can be comfortable\r\nin them?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But we shall live to see the day, I trust,” went on the artist,\r\n“when no man shall build his house for posterity. Why should he? He might\r\njust as reasonably order a durable suit of clothes,—leather, or\r\nguttapercha, or whatever else lasts longest,—so that his\r\ngreat-grandchildren should have the benefit of them, and cut precisely the same\r\nfigure in the world that he himself does. If each generation were allowed and\r\nexpected to build its own houses, that single change, comparatively unimportant\r\nin itself, would imply almost every reform which society is now suffering for.\r\nI doubt whether even our public edifices—our capitols, state-houses,\r\ncourt-houses, city-hall, and churches,—ought to be built of such\r\npermanent materials as stone or brick. It were better that they should crumble\r\nto ruin once in twenty years, or thereabouts, as a hint to the people to\r\nexamine into and reform the institutions which they symbolize.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How you hate everything old!” said Phœbe in dismay. “It\r\nmakes me dizzy to think of such a shifting world!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I certainly love nothing mouldy,” answered Holgrave. “Now,\r\nthis old Pyncheon House! Is it a wholesome place to live in, with its black\r\nshingles, and the green moss that shows how damp they are?—its dark,\r\nlow-studded rooms—its grime and sordidness, which are the crystallization\r\non its walls of the human breath, that has been drawn and exhaled here in\r\ndiscontent and anguish? The house ought to be purified with\r\nfire,—purified till only its ashes remain!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then why do you live in it?” asked Phœbe, a little piqued.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I am pursuing my studies here; not in books, however,” replied\r\nHolgrave. “The house, in my view, is expressive of that odious and\r\nabominable Past, with all its bad influences, against which I have just been\r\ndeclaiming. I dwell in it for a while, that I may know the better how to hate\r\nit. By the bye, did you ever hear the story of Maule, the wizard, and what\r\nhappened between him and your immeasurably great-grandfather?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, indeed!” said Phœbe; “I heard it long ago, from my\r\nfather, and two or three times from my cousin Hepzibah, in the month that I\r\nhave been here. She seems to think that all the calamities of the Pyncheons\r\nbegan from that quarrel with the wizard, as you call him. And you, Mr. Holgrave\r\nlook as if you thought so too! How singular that you should believe what is so\r\nvery absurd, when you reject many things that are a great deal worthier of\r\ncredit!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do believe it,” said the artist seriously; “not as a\r\nsuperstition, however, but as proved by unquestionable facts, and as\r\nexemplifying a theory. Now, see: under those seven gables, at which we now look\r\nup,—and which old Colonel Pyncheon meant to be the house of his\r\ndescendants, in prosperity and happiness, down to an epoch far beyond the\r\npresent,—under that roof, through a portion of three centuries, there has\r\nbeen perpetual remorse of conscience, a constantly defeated hope, strife\r\namongst kindred, various misery, a strange form of death, dark suspicion,\r\nunspeakable disgrace,—all, or most of which calamity I have the means of\r\ntracing to the old Puritan’s inordinate desire to plant and endow a\r\nfamily. To plant a family! This idea is at the bottom of most of the wrong and\r\nmischief which men do. The truth is, that, once in every half-century, at\r\nlongest, a family should be merged into the great, obscure mass of humanity,\r\nand forget all about its ancestors. Human blood, in order to keep its\r\nfreshness, should run in hidden streams, as the water of an aqueduct is\r\nconveyed in subterranean pipes. In the family existence of these Pyncheons, for\r\ninstance,—forgive me Phœbe, but I cannot think of you as one of\r\nthem,—in their brief New England pedigree, there has been time enough to\r\ninfect them all with one kind of lunacy or another.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You speak very unceremoniously of my kindred,” said Phœbe,\r\ndebating with herself whether she ought to take offence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I speak true thoughts to a true mind!” answered Holgrave, with a\r\nvehemence which Phœbe had not before witnessed in him. “The truth is as\r\nI say! Furthermore, the original perpetrator and father of this mischief\r\nappears to have perpetuated himself, and still walks the street,—at\r\nleast, his very image, in mind and body,—with the fairest prospect of\r\ntransmitting to posterity as rich and as wretched an inheritance as he has\r\nreceived! Do you remember the daguerreotype, and its resemblance to the old\r\nportrait?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How strangely in earnest you are!” exclaimed Phœbe, looking at\r\nhim with surprise and perplexity; half alarmed and partly inclined to laugh.\r\n“You talk of the lunacy of the Pyncheons; is it contagious?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I understand you!” said the artist, coloring and laughing.\r\n“I believe I am a little mad. This subject has taken hold of my mind with\r\nthe strangest tenacity of clutch since I have lodged in yonder old gable. As\r\none method of throwing it off, I have put an incident of the Pyncheon family\r\nhistory, with which I happen to be acquainted, into the form of a legend, and\r\nmean to publish it in a magazine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you write for the magazines?” inquired Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is it possible you did not know it?” cried Holgrave. “Well,\r\nsuch is literary fame! Yes. Miss Phœbe Pyncheon, among the multitude of my\r\nmarvellous gifts I have that of writing stories; and my name has figured, I can\r\nassure you, on the covers of Graham and Godey, making as respectable an\r\nappearance, for aught I could see, as any of the canonized bead-roll with which\r\nit was associated. In the humorous line, I am thought to have a very pretty way\r\nwith me; and as for pathos, I am as provocative of tears as an onion. But shall\r\nI read you my story?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, if it is not very long,” said Phœbe,—and added\r\nlaughingly,—“nor very dull.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs this latter point was one which the daguerreotypist could not decide for\r\nhimself, he forthwith produced his roll of manuscript, and, while the late\r\nsunbeams gilded the seven gables, began to read.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap13\"></a>XIII.<br>\r\nAlice Pyncheon</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a message brought, one day, from the worshipful Gervayse Pyncheon to\r\nyoung Matthew Maule, the carpenter, desiring his immediate presence at the\r\nHouse of the Seven Gables.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And what does your master want with me?” said the carpenter to Mr.\r\nPyncheon’s black servant. “Does the house need any repair? Well it\r\nmay, by this time; and no blame to my father who built it, neither! I was\r\nreading the old Colonel’s tombstone, no longer ago than last Sabbath;\r\nand, reckoning from that date, the house has stood seven-and-thirty years. No\r\nwonder if there should be a job to do on the roof.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t know what massa wants,” answered Scipio. “The\r\nhouse is a berry good house, and old Colonel Pyncheon think so too, I\r\nreckon;—else why the old man haunt it so, and frighten a poor nigga, As\r\nhe does?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, well, friend Scipio; let your master know that I’m\r\ncoming,” said the carpenter with a laugh. “For a fair, workmanlike\r\njob, he’ll find me his man. And so the house is haunted, is it? It will\r\ntake a tighter workman than I am to keep the spirits out of the Seven Gables.\r\nEven if the Colonel would be quiet,” he added, muttering to himself,\r\n“my old grandfather, the wizard, will be pretty sure to stick to the\r\nPyncheons as long as their walls hold together.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s that you mutter to yourself, Matthew Maule?” asked\r\nScipio. “And what for do you look so black at me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No matter, darky,” said the carpenter. “Do you think nobody\r\nis to look black but yourself? Go tell your master I’m coming; and if you\r\nhappen to see Mistress Alice, his daughter, give Matthew Maule’s humble\r\nrespects to her. She has brought a fair face from Italy,—fair, and\r\ngentle, and proud,—has that same Alice Pyncheon!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He talk of Mistress Alice!” cried Scipio, as he returned from his\r\nerrand. “The low carpenter-man! He no business so much as to look at her\r\na great way off!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis young Matthew Maule, the carpenter, it must be observed, was a person\r\nlittle understood, and not very generally liked, in the town where he resided;\r\nnot that anything could be alleged against his integrity, or his skill and\r\ndiligence in the handicraft which he exercised. The aversion (as it might\r\njustly be called) with which many persons regarded him was partly the result of\r\nhis own character and deportment, and partly an inheritance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was the grandson of a former Matthew Maule, one of the early settlers of the\r\ntown, and who had been a famous and terrible wizard in his day. This old\r\nreprobate was one of the sufferers when Cotton Mather, and his brother\r\nministers, and the learned judges, and other wise men, and Sir William Phipps,\r\nthe sagacious governor, made such laudable efforts to weaken the great enemy of\r\nsouls, by sending a multitude of his adherents up the rocky pathway of Gallows\r\nHill. Since those days, no doubt, it had grown to be suspected that, in\r\nconsequence of an unfortunate overdoing of a work praiseworthy in itself, the\r\nproceedings against the witches had proved far less acceptable to the\r\nBeneficent Father than to that very Arch Enemy whom they were intended to\r\ndistress and utterly overwhelm. It is not the less certain, however, that awe\r\nand terror brooded over the memories of those who died for this horrible crime\r\nof witchcraft. Their graves, in the crevices of the rocks, were supposed to be\r\nincapable of retaining the occupants who had been so hastily thrust into them.\r\nOld Matthew Maule, especially, was known to have as little hesitation or\r\ndifficulty in rising out of his grave as an ordinary man in getting out of bed,\r\nand was as often seen at midnight as living people at noonday. This pestilent\r\nwizard (in whom his just punishment seemed to have wrought no manner of\r\namendment) had an inveterate habit of haunting a certain mansion, styled the\r\nHouse of the Seven Gables, against the owner of which he pretended to hold an\r\nunsettled claim for ground-rent. The ghost, it appears,—with the\r\npertinacity which was one of his distinguishing characteristics while\r\nalive,—insisted that he was the rightful proprietor of the site upon\r\nwhich the house stood. His terms were, that either the aforesaid ground-rent,\r\nfrom the day when the cellar began to be dug, should be paid down, or the\r\nmansion itself given up; else he, the ghostly creditor, would have his finger\r\nin all the affairs of the Pyncheons, and make everything go wrong with them,\r\nthough it should be a thousand years after his death. It was a wild story,\r\nperhaps, but seemed not altogether so incredible to those who could remember\r\nwhat an inflexibly obstinate old fellow this wizard Maule had been.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow, the wizard’s grandson, the young Matthew Maule of our story, was\r\npopularly supposed to have inherited some of his ancestor’s questionable\r\ntraits. It is wonderful how many absurdities were promulgated in reference to\r\nthe young man. He was fabled, for example, to have a strange power of getting\r\ninto people’s dreams, and regulating matters there according to his own\r\nfancy, pretty much like the stage-manager of a theatre. There was a great deal\r\nof talk among the neighbors, particularly the petticoated ones, about what they\r\ncalled the witchcraft of Maule’s eye. Some said that he could look into\r\npeople’s minds; others, that, by the marvellous power of this eye, he\r\ncould draw people into his own mind, or send them, if he pleased, to do errands\r\nto his grandfather, in the spiritual world; others, again, that it was what is\r\ntermed an Evil Eye, and possessed the valuable faculty of blighting corn, and\r\ndrying children into mummies with the heartburn. But, after all, what worked\r\nmost to the young carpenter’s disadvantage was, first, the reserve and\r\nsternness of his natural disposition, and next, the fact of his not being a\r\nchurch-communicant, and the suspicion of his holding heretical tenets in\r\nmatters of religion and polity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter receiving Mr. Pyncheon’s message, the carpenter merely tarried to\r\nfinish a small job, which he happened to have in hand, and then took his way\r\ntowards the House of the Seven Gables. This noted edifice, though its style\r\nmight be getting a little out of fashion, was still as respectable a family\r\nresidence as that of any gentleman in town. The present owner, Gervayse\r\nPyncheon, was said to have contracted a dislike to the house, in consequence of\r\na shock to his sensibility, in early childhood, from the sudden death of his\r\ngrandfather. In the very act of running to climb Colonel Pyncheon’s knee,\r\nthe boy had discovered the old Puritan to be a corpse. On arriving at manhood,\r\nMr. Pyncheon had visited England, where he married a lady of fortune, and had\r\nsubsequently spent many years, partly in the mother country, and partly in\r\nvarious cities on the continent of Europe. During this period, the family\r\nmansion had been consigned to the charge of a kinsman, who was allowed to make\r\nit his home for the time being, in consideration of keeping the premises in\r\nthorough repair. So faithfully had this contract been fulfilled, that now, as\r\nthe carpenter approached the house, his practised eye could detect nothing to\r\ncriticise in its condition. The peaks of the seven gables rose up sharply; the\r\nshingled roof looked thoroughly water-tight; and the glittering plaster-work\r\nentirely covered the exterior walls, and sparkled in the October sun, as if it\r\nhad been new only a week ago.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe house had that pleasant aspect of life which is like the cheery expression\r\nof comfortable activity in the human countenance. You could see, at once, that\r\nthere was the stir of a large family within it. A huge load of oak-wood was\r\npassing through the gateway, towards the outbuildings in the rear; the fat\r\ncook—or probably it might be the housekeeper—stood at the side\r\ndoor, bargaining for some turkeys and poultry which a countryman had brought\r\nfor sale. Now and then a maid-servant, neatly dressed, and now the shining\r\nsable face of a slave, might be seen bustling across the windows, in the lower\r\npart of the house. At an open window of a room in the second story, hanging\r\nover some pots of beautiful and delicate flowers,—exotics, but which had\r\nnever known a more genial sunshine than that of the New England\r\nautumn,—was the figure of a young lady, an exotic, like the flowers, and\r\nbeautiful and delicate as they. Her presence imparted an indescribable grace\r\nand faint witchery to the whole edifice. In other respects, it was a\r\nsubstantial, jolly-looking mansion, and seemed fit to be the residence of a\r\npatriarch, who might establish his own headquarters in the front gable and\r\nassign one of the remainder to each of his six children, while the great\r\nchimney in the centre should symbolize the old fellow’s hospitable heart,\r\nwhich kept them all warm, and made a great whole of the seven smaller ones.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a vertical sundial on the front gable; and as the carpenter passed\r\nbeneath it, he looked up and noted the hour.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Three o’clock!” said he to himself. “My father told me\r\nthat dial was put up only an hour before the old Colonel’s death. How\r\ntruly it has kept time these seven-and-thirty years past! The shadow creeps and\r\ncreeps, and is always looking over the shoulder of the sunshine!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt might have befitted a craftsman, like Matthew Maule, on being sent for to a\r\ngentleman’s house, to go to the back door, where servants and work-people\r\nwere usually admitted; or at least to the side entrance, where the better class\r\nof tradesmen made application. But the carpenter had a great deal of pride and\r\nstiffness in his nature; and, at this moment, moreover, his heart was bitter\r\nwith the sense of hereditary wrong, because he considered the great Pyncheon\r\nHouse to be standing on soil which should have been his own. On this very site,\r\nbeside a spring of delicious water, his grandfather had felled the pine-trees\r\nand built a cottage, in which children had been born to him; and it was only\r\nfrom a dead man’s stiffened fingers that Colonel Pyncheon had wrested\r\naway the title-deeds. So young Maule went straight to the principal entrance,\r\nbeneath a portal of carved oak, and gave such a peal of the iron knocker that\r\nyou would have imagined the stern old wizard himself to be standing at the\r\nthreshold.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBlack Scipio answered the summons in a prodigious hurry; but showed the whites\r\nof his eyes, in amazement on beholding only the carpenter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Lord-a-mercy, what a great man he be, this carpenter fellow!”\r\nmumbled Scipio, down in his throat. “Anybody think he beat on the door\r\nwith his biggest hammer!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here I am!” said Maule sternly. “Show me the way to your\r\nmaster’s parlor.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he stept into the house, a note of sweet and melancholy music thrilled and\r\nvibrated along the passage-way, proceeding from one of the rooms above stairs.\r\nIt was the harpsichord which Alice Pyncheon had brought with her from beyond\r\nthe sea. The fair Alice bestowed most of her maiden leisure between flowers and\r\nmusic, although the former were apt to droop, and the melodies were often sad.\r\nShe was of foreign education, and could not take kindly to the New England\r\nmodes of life, in which nothing beautiful had ever been developed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs Mr. Pyncheon had been impatiently awaiting Maule’s arrival, black\r\nScipio, of course, lost no time in ushering the carpenter into his\r\nmaster’s presence. The room in which this gentleman sat was a parlor of\r\nmoderate size, looking out upon the garden of the house, and having its windows\r\npartly shadowed by the foliage of fruit-trees. It was Mr. Pyncheon’s\r\npeculiar apartment, and was provided with furniture, in an elegant and costly\r\nstyle, principally from Paris; the floor (which was unusual at that day) being\r\ncovered with a carpet, so skilfully and richly wrought that it seemed to glow\r\nas with living flowers. In one corner stood a marble woman, to whom her own\r\nbeauty was the sole and sufficient garment. Some pictures—that looked\r\nold, and had a mellow tinge diffused through all their artful\r\nsplendor—hung on the walls. Near the fireplace was a large and very\r\nbeautiful cabinet of ebony, inlaid with ivory; a piece of antique furniture,\r\nwhich Mr. Pyncheon had bought in Venice, and which he used as the\r\ntreasure-place for medals, ancient coins, and whatever small and valuable\r\ncuriosities he had picked up on his travels. Through all this variety of\r\ndecoration, however, the room showed its original characteristics; its low\r\nstud, its cross-beam, its chimney-piece, with the old-fashioned Dutch tiles; so\r\nthat it was the emblem of a mind industriously stored with foreign ideas, and\r\nelaborated into artificial refinement, but neither larger, nor, in its proper\r\nself, more elegant than before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere were two objects that appeared rather out of place in this very\r\nhandsomely furnished room. One was a large map, or surveyor’s plan, of a\r\ntract of land, which looked as if it had been drawn a good many years ago, and\r\nwas now dingy with smoke, and soiled, here and there, with the touch of\r\nfingers. The other was a portrait of a stern old man, in a Puritan garb,\r\npainted roughly, but with a bold effect, and a remarkably strong expression of\r\ncharacter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt a small table, before a fire of English sea-coal, sat Mr. Pyncheon, sipping\r\ncoffee, which had grown to be a very favorite beverage with him in France. He\r\nwas a middle-aged and really handsome man, with a wig flowing down upon his\r\nshoulders; his coat was of blue velvet, with lace on the borders and at the\r\nbutton-holes; and the firelight glistened on the spacious breadth of his\r\nwaistcoat, which was flowered all over with gold. On the entrance of Scipio,\r\nushering in the carpenter, Mr. Pyncheon turned partly round, but resumed his\r\nformer position, and proceeded deliberately to finish his cup of coffee,\r\nwithout immediate notice of the guest whom he had summoned to his presence. It\r\nwas not that he intended any rudeness or improper neglect,—which, indeed,\r\nhe would have blushed to be guilty of,—but it never occurred to him that\r\na person in Maule’s station had a claim on his courtesy, or would trouble\r\nhimself about it one way or the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe carpenter, however, stepped at once to the hearth, and turned himself\r\nabout, so as to look Mr. Pyncheon in the face.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You sent for me,” said he. “Be pleased to explain your\r\nbusiness, that I may go back to my own affairs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! excuse me,” said Mr. Pyncheon quietly. “I did not mean\r\nto tax your time without a recompense. Your name, I think, is\r\nMaule,—Thomas or Matthew Maule,—a son or grandson of the builder of\r\nthis house?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Matthew Maule,” replied the carpenter,—“son of him who\r\nbuilt the house,—grandson of the rightful proprietor of the soil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know the dispute to which you allude,” observed Mr. Pyncheon\r\nwith undisturbed equanimity. “I am well aware that my grandfather was\r\ncompelled to resort to a suit at law, in order to establish his claim to the\r\nfoundation-site of this edifice. We will not, if you please, renew the\r\ndiscussion. The matter was settled at the time, and by the competent\r\nauthorities,—equitably, it is to be presumed,—and, at all events,\r\nirrevocably. Yet, singularly enough, there is an incidental reference to this\r\nvery subject in what I am now about to say to you. And this same inveterate\r\ngrudge,—excuse me, I mean no offence,—this irritability, which you\r\nhave just shown, is not entirely aside from the matter.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you can find anything for your purpose, Mr. Pyncheon,” said the\r\ncarpenter, “in a man’s natural resentment for the wrongs done to\r\nhis blood, you are welcome to it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I take you at your word, Goodman Maule,” said the owner of the\r\nSeven Gables, with a smile, “and will proceed to suggest a mode in which\r\nyour hereditary resentments—justifiable or otherwise—may have had a\r\nbearing on my affairs. You have heard, I suppose, that the Pyncheon family,\r\never since my grandfather’s days, have been prosecuting a still unsettled\r\nclaim to a very large extent of territory at the Eastward?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Often,” replied Maule,—and it is said that a smile came over\r\nhis face,—“very often,—from my father!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This claim,” continued Mr. Pyncheon, after pausing a moment, as if\r\nto consider what the carpenter’s smile might mean, “appeared to be\r\non the very verge of a settlement and full allowance, at the period of my\r\ngrandfather’s decease. It was well known, to those in his confidence,\r\nthat he anticipated neither difficulty nor delay. Now, Colonel Pyncheon, I need\r\nhardly say, was a practical man, well acquainted with public and private\r\nbusiness, and not at all the person to cherish ill-founded hopes, or to attempt\r\nthe following out of an impracticable scheme. It is obvious to conclude,\r\ntherefore, that he had grounds, not apparent to his heirs, for his confident\r\nanticipation of success in the matter of this Eastern claim. In a word, I\r\nbelieve,—and my legal advisers coincide in the belief, which, moreover,\r\nis authorized, to a certain extent, by the family traditions,—that my\r\ngrandfather was in possession of some deed, or other document, essential to\r\nthis claim, but which has since disappeared.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very likely,” said Matthew Maule,—and again, it is said,\r\nthere was a dark smile on his face,—“but what can a poor carpenter\r\nhave to do with the grand affairs of the Pyncheon family?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Perhaps nothing,” returned Mr. Pyncheon, “possibly\r\nmuch!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere ensued a great many words between Matthew Maule and the proprietor of the\r\nSeven Gables, on the subject which the latter had thus broached. It seems\r\n(although Mr. Pyncheon had some hesitation in referring to stories so\r\nexceedingly absurd in their aspect) that the popular belief pointed to some\r\nmysterious connection and dependence, existing between the family of the Maules\r\nand these vast unrealized possessions of the Pyncheons. It was an ordinary\r\nsaying that the old wizard, hanged though he was, had obtained the best end of\r\nthe bargain in his contest with Colonel Pyncheon; inasmuch as he had got\r\npossession of the great Eastern claim, in exchange for an acre or two of\r\ngarden-ground. A very aged woman, recently dead, had often used the\r\nmetaphorical expression, in her fireside talk, that miles and miles of the\r\nPyncheon lands had been shovelled into Maule’s grave; which, by the bye,\r\nwas but a very shallow nook, between two rocks, near the summit of Gallows\r\nHill. Again, when the lawyers were making inquiry for the missing document, it\r\nwas a by-word that it would never be found, unless in the wizard’s\r\nskeleton hand. So much weight had the shrewd lawyers assigned to these fables,\r\nthat (but Mr. Pyncheon did not see fit to inform the carpenter of the fact)\r\nthey had secretly caused the wizard’s grave to be searched. Nothing was\r\ndiscovered, however, except that, unaccountably, the right hand of the skeleton\r\nwas gone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow, what was unquestionably important, a portion of these popular rumors could\r\nbe traced, though rather doubtfully and indistinctly, to chance words and\r\nobscure hints of the executed wizard’s son, and the father of this\r\npresent Matthew Maule. And here Mr. Pyncheon could bring an item of his own\r\npersonal evidence into play. Though but a child at the time, he either\r\nremembered or fancied that Matthew’s father had had some job to perform\r\non the day before, or possibly the very morning of the Colonel’s decease,\r\nin the private room where he and the carpenter were at this moment talking.\r\nCertain papers belonging to Colonel Pyncheon, as his grandson distinctly\r\nrecollected, had been spread out on the table.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMatthew Maule understood the insinuated suspicion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My father,” he said,—but still there was that dark smile,\r\nmaking a riddle of his countenance,—“my father was an honester man\r\nthan the bloody old Colonel! Not to get his rights back again would he have\r\ncarried off one of those papers!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall not bandy words with you,” observed the foreign-bred Mr.\r\nPyncheon, with haughty composure. “Nor will it become me to resent any\r\nrudeness towards either my grandfather or myself. A gentleman, before seeking\r\nintercourse with a person of your station and habits, will first consider\r\nwhether the urgency of the end may compensate for the disagreeableness of the\r\nmeans. It does so in the present instance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe then renewed the conversation, and made great pecuniary offers to the\r\ncarpenter, in case the latter should give information leading to the discovery\r\nof the lost document, and the consequent success of the Eastern claim. For a\r\nlong time Matthew Maule is said to have turned a cold ear to these\r\npropositions. At last, however, with a strange kind of laugh, he inquired\r\nwhether Mr. Pyncheon would make over to him the old wizard’s\r\nhomestead-ground, together with the House of the Seven Gables, now standing on\r\nit, in requital of the documentary evidence so urgently required.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wild, chimney-corner legend (which, without copying all its extravagances,\r\nmy narrative essentially follows) here gives an account of some very strange\r\nbehavior on the part of Colonel Pyncheon’s portrait. This picture, it\r\nmust be understood, was supposed to be so intimately connected with the fate of\r\nthe house, and so magically built into its walls, that, if once it should be\r\nremoved, that very instant the whole edifice would come thundering down in a\r\nheap of dusty ruin. All through the foregoing conversation between Mr. Pyncheon\r\nand the carpenter, the portrait had been frowning, clenching its fist, and\r\ngiving many such proofs of excessive discomposure, but without attracting the\r\nnotice of either of the two colloquists. And finally, at Matthew Maule’s\r\naudacious suggestion of a transfer of the seven-gabled structure, the ghostly\r\nportrait is averred to have lost all patience, and to have shown itself on the\r\npoint of descending bodily from its frame. But such incredible incidents are\r\nmerely to be mentioned aside.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Give up this house!” exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, in amazement at the\r\nproposal. “Were I to do so, my grandfather would not rest quiet in his\r\ngrave!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He never has, if all stories are true,” remarked the carpenter\r\ncomposedly. “But that matter concerns his grandson more than it does\r\nMatthew Maule. I have no other terms to propose.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImpossible as he at first thought it to comply with Maule’s conditions,\r\nstill, on a second glance, Mr. Pyncheon was of opinion that they might at least\r\nbe made matter of discussion. He himself had no personal attachment for the\r\nhouse, nor any pleasant associations connected with his childish residence in\r\nit. On the contrary, after seven-and-thirty years, the presence of his dead\r\ngrandfather seemed still to pervade it, as on that morning when the affrighted\r\nboy had beheld him, with so ghastly an aspect, stiffening in his chair. His\r\nlong abode in foreign parts, moreover, and familiarity with many of the castles\r\nand ancestral halls of England, and the marble palaces of Italy, had caused him\r\nto look contemptuously at the House of the Seven Gables, whether in point of\r\nsplendor or convenience. It was a mansion exceedingly inadequate to the style\r\nof living which it would be incumbent on Mr. Pyncheon to support, after\r\nrealizing his territorial rights. His steward might deign to occupy it, but\r\nnever, certainly, the great landed proprietor himself. In the event of success,\r\nindeed, it was his purpose to return to England; nor, to say the truth, would\r\nhe recently have quitted that more congenial home, had not his own fortune, as\r\nwell as his deceased wife’s, begun to give symptoms of exhaustion. The\r\nEastern claim once fairly settled, and put upon the firm basis of actual\r\npossession, Mr. Pyncheon’s property—to be measured by miles, not\r\nacres—would be worth an earldom, and would reasonably entitle him to\r\nsolicit, or enable him to purchase, that elevated dignity from the British\r\nmonarch. Lord Pyncheon!—or the Earl of Waldo!—how could such a\r\nmagnate be expected to contract his grandeur within the pitiful compass of\r\nseven shingled gables?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn short, on an enlarged view of the business, the carpenter’s terms\r\nappeared so ridiculously easy that Mr. Pyncheon could scarcely forbear laughing\r\nin his face. He was quite ashamed, after the foregoing reflections, to propose\r\nany diminution of so moderate a recompense for the immense service to be\r\nrendered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I consent to your proposition, Maule!” cried he. “Put me in\r\npossession of the document essential to establish my rights, and the House of\r\nthe Seven Gables is your own!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to some versions of the story, a regular contract to the above effect\r\nwas drawn up by a lawyer, and signed and sealed in the presence of witnesses.\r\nOthers say that Matthew Maule was contented with a private written agreement,\r\nin which Mr. Pyncheon pledged his honor and integrity to the fulfillment of the\r\nterms concluded upon. The gentleman then ordered wine, which he and the\r\ncarpenter drank together, in confirmation of their bargain. During the whole\r\npreceding discussion and subsequent formalities, the old Puritan’s\r\nportrait seems to have persisted in its shadowy gestures of disapproval; but\r\nwithout effect, except that, as Mr. Pyncheon set down the emptied glass, he\r\nthought he beheld his grandfather frown.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This sherry is too potent a wine for me; it has affected my brain\r\nalready,” he observed, after a somewhat startled look at the picture.\r\n“On returning to Europe, I shall confine myself to the more delicate\r\nvintages of Italy and France, the best of which will not bear\r\ntransportation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My Lord Pyncheon may drink what wine he will, and wherever he\r\npleases,” replied the carpenter, as if he had been privy to Mr.\r\nPyncheon’s ambitious projects. “But first, sir, if you desire\r\ntidings of this lost document, I must crave the favor of a little talk with\r\nyour fair daughter Alice.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are mad, Maule!” exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon haughtily; and now, at\r\nlast, there was anger mixed up with his pride. “What can my daughter have\r\nto do with a business like this?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIndeed, at this new demand on the carpenter’s part, the proprietor of the\r\nSeven Gables was even more thunder-struck than at the cool proposition to\r\nsurrender his house. There was, at least, an assignable motive for the first\r\nstipulation; there appeared to be none whatever for the last. Nevertheless,\r\nMatthew Maule sturdily insisted on the young lady being summoned, and even gave\r\nher father to understand, in a mysterious kind of explanation,—which made\r\nthe matter considerably darker than it looked before,—that the only\r\nchance of acquiring the requisite knowledge was through the clear, crystal\r\nmedium of a pure and virgin intelligence, like that of the fair Alice. Not to\r\nencumber our story with Mr. Pyncheon’s scruples, whether of conscience,\r\npride, or fatherly affection, he at length ordered his daughter to be called.\r\nHe well knew that she was in her chamber, and engaged in no occupation that\r\ncould not readily be laid aside; for, as it happened, ever since Alice’s\r\nname had been spoken, both her father and the carpenter had heard the sad and\r\nsweet music of her harpsichord, and the airier melancholy of her accompanying\r\nvoice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo Alice Pyncheon was summoned, and appeared. A portrait of this young lady,\r\npainted by a Venetian artist, and left by her father in England, is said to\r\nhave fallen into the hands of the present Duke of Devonshire, and to be now\r\npreserved at Chatsworth; not on account of any associations with the original,\r\nbut for its value as a picture, and the high character of beauty in the\r\ncountenance. If ever there was a lady born, and set apart from the\r\nworld’s vulgar mass by a certain gentle and cold stateliness, it was this\r\nvery Alice Pyncheon. Yet there was the womanly mixture in her; the tenderness,\r\nor, at least, the tender capabilities. For the sake of that redeeming quality,\r\na man of generous nature would have forgiven all her pride, and have been\r\ncontent, almost, to lie down in her path, and let Alice set her slender foot\r\nupon his heart. All that he would have required was simply the acknowledgment\r\nthat he was indeed a man, and a fellow-being, moulded of the same elements as\r\nshe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs Alice came into the room, her eyes fell upon the carpenter, who was standing\r\nnear its centre, clad in green woollen jacket, a pair of loose breeches, open\r\nat the knees, and with a long pocket for his rule, the end of which protruded;\r\nit was as proper a mark of the artisan’s calling as Mr. Pyncheon’s\r\nfull-dress sword of that gentleman’s aristocratic pretensions. A glow of\r\nartistic approval brightened over Alice Pyncheon’s face; she was struck\r\nwith admiration—which she made no attempt to conceal—of the\r\nremarkable comeliness, strength, and energy of Maule’s figure. But that\r\nadmiring glance (which most other men, perhaps, would have cherished as a sweet\r\nrecollection all through life) the carpenter never forgave. It must have been\r\nthe devil himself that made Maule so subtile in his preception.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Does the girl look at me as if I were a brute beast?” thought he,\r\nsetting his teeth. “She shall know whether I have a human spirit; and the\r\nworse for her, if it prove stronger than her own!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My father, you sent for me,” said Alice, in her sweet and\r\nharp-like voice. “But, if you have business with this young man, pray let\r\nme go again. You know I do not love this room, in spite of that Claude, with\r\nwhich you try to bring back sunny recollections.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stay a moment, young lady, if you please!” said Matthew Maule.\r\n“My business with your father is over. With yourself, it is now to\r\nbegin!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlice looked towards her father, in surprise and inquiry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Alice,” said Mr. Pyncheon, with some disturbance and\r\nconfusion. “This young man—his name is Matthew\r\nMaule—professes, so far as I can understand him, to be able to discover,\r\nthrough your means, a certain paper or parchment, which was missing long before\r\nyour birth. The importance of the document in question renders it advisable to\r\nneglect no possible, even if improbable, method of regaining it. You will\r\ntherefore oblige me, my dear Alice, by answering this person’s inquiries,\r\nand complying with his lawful and reasonable requests, so far as they may\r\nappear to have the aforesaid object in view. As I shall remain in the room, you\r\nneed apprehend no rude nor unbecoming deportment, on the young man’s\r\npart; and, at your slightest wish, of course, the investigation, or whatever we\r\nmay call it, shall immediately be broken off.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mistress Alice Pyncheon,” remarked Matthew Maule, with the utmost\r\ndeference, but yet a half-hidden sarcasm in his look and tone, “will no\r\ndoubt feel herself quite safe in her father’s presence, and under his\r\nall-sufficient protection.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I certainly shall entertain no manner of apprehension, with my father at\r\nhand,” said Alice with maidenly dignity. “Neither do I conceive\r\nthat a lady, while true to herself, can have aught to fear from whomsoever, or\r\nin any circumstances!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Alice! By what unhappy impulse did she thus put herself at once on terms\r\nof defiance against a strength which she could not estimate?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then, Mistress Alice,” said Matthew Maule, handing a\r\nchair,—gracefully enough, for a craftsman, “will it please you only\r\nto sit down, and do me the favor (though altogether beyond a poor\r\ncarpenter’s deserts) to fix your eyes on mine!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlice complied, She was very proud. Setting aside all advantages of rank, this\r\nfair girl deemed herself conscious of a power—combined of beauty, high,\r\nunsullied purity, and the preservative force of womanhood—that could make\r\nher sphere impenetrable, unless betrayed by treachery within. She instinctively\r\nknew, it may be, that some sinister or evil potency was now striving to pass\r\nher barriers; nor would she decline the contest. So Alice put woman’s\r\nmight against man’s might; a match not often equal on the part of woman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer father meanwhile had turned away, and seemed absorbed in the contemplation\r\nof a landscape by Claude, where a shadowy and sun-streaked vista penetrated so\r\nremotely into an ancient wood, that it would have been no wonder if his fancy\r\nhad lost itself in the picture’s bewildering depths. But, in truth, the\r\npicture was no more to him at that moment than the blank wall against which it\r\nhung. His mind was haunted with the many and strange tales which he had heard,\r\nattributing mysterious if not supernatural endowments to these Maules, as well\r\nthe grandson here present as his two immediate ancestors. Mr. Pyncheon’s\r\nlong residence abroad, and intercourse with men of wit and\r\nfashion,—courtiers, worldlings, and free-thinkers,—had done much\r\ntowards obliterating the grim Puritan superstitions, which no man of New\r\nEngland birth at that early period could entirely escape. But, on the other\r\nhand, had not a whole community believed Maule’s grandfather to be a\r\nwizard? Had not the crime been proved? Had not the wizard died for it? Had he\r\nnot bequeathed a legacy of hatred against the Pyncheons to this only grandson,\r\nwho, as it appeared, was now about to exercise a subtle influence over the\r\ndaughter of his enemy’s house? Might not this influence be the same that\r\nwas called witchcraft?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTurning half around, he caught a glimpse of Maule’s figure in the\r\nlooking-glass. At some paces from Alice, with his arms uplifted in the air, the\r\ncarpenter made a gesture as if directing downward a slow, ponderous, and\r\ninvisible weight upon the maiden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stay, Maule!” exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon, stepping forward. “I\r\nforbid your proceeding further!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pray, my dear father, do not interrupt the young man,” said Alice,\r\nwithout changing her position. “His efforts, I assure you, will prove\r\nvery harmless.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAgain Mr. Pyncheon turned his eyes towards the Claude. It was then his\r\ndaughter’s will, in opposition to his own, that the experiment should be\r\nfully tried. Henceforth, therefore, he did but consent, not urge it. And was it\r\nnot for her sake far more than for his own that he desired its success? That\r\nlost parchment once restored, the beautiful Alice Pyncheon, with the rich dowry\r\nwhich he could then bestow, might wed an English duke or a German\r\nreigning-prince, instead of some New England clergyman or lawyer! At the\r\nthought, the ambitious father almost consented, in his heart, that, if the\r\ndevil’s power were needed to the accomplishment of this great object,\r\nMaule might evoke him. Alice’s own purity would be her safeguard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith his mind full of imaginary magnificence, Mr. Pyncheon heard a half-uttered\r\nexclamation from his daughter. It was very faint and low; so indistinct that\r\nthere seemed but half a will to shape out the words, and too undefined a\r\npurport to be intelligible. Yet it was a call for help!—his conscience\r\nnever doubted it;—and, little more than a whisper to his ear, it was a\r\ndismal shriek, and long reechoed so, in the region round his heart! But this\r\ntime the father did not turn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a further interval, Maule spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Behold your daughter,” said he.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Pyncheon came hastily forward. The carpenter was standing erect in front of\r\nAlice’s chair, and pointing his finger towards the maiden with an\r\nexpression of triumphant power, the limits of which could not be defined, as,\r\nindeed, its scope stretched vaguely towards the unseen and the infinite. Alice\r\nsat in an attitude of profound repose, with the long brown lashes drooping over\r\nher eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There she is!” said the carpenter. “Speak to her!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alice! My daughter!” exclaimed Mr. Pyncheon. “My own\r\nAlice!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe did not stir.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Louder!” said Maule, smiling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alice! Awake!” cried her father. “It troubles me to see you\r\nthus! Awake!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke loudly, with terror in his voice, and close to that delicate ear which\r\nhad always been so sensitive to every discord. But the sound evidently reached\r\nher not. It is indescribable what a sense of remote, dim, unattainable distance\r\nbetwixt himself and Alice was impressed on the father by this impossibility of\r\nreaching her with his voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Best touch her!” said Matthew Maule “Shake the girl, and\r\nroughly, too! My hands are hardened with too much use of axe, saw, and\r\nplane,—else I might help you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Pyncheon took her hand, and pressed it with the earnestness of startled\r\nemotion. He kissed her, with so great a heart-throb in the kiss, that he\r\nthought she must needs feel it. Then, in a gust of anger at her insensibility,\r\nhe shook her maiden form with a violence which, the next moment, it affrighted\r\nhim to remember. He withdrew his encircling arms, and Alice—whose figure,\r\nthough flexible, had been wholly impassive—relapsed into the same\r\nattitude as before these attempts to arouse her. Maule having shifted his\r\nposition, her face was turned towards him slightly, but with what seemed to be\r\na reference of her very slumber to his guidance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen it was a strange sight to behold how the man of conventionalities shook\r\nthe powder out of his periwig; how the reserved and stately gentleman forgot\r\nhis dignity; how the gold-embroidered waistcoat flickered and glistened in the\r\nfirelight with the convulsion of rage, terror, and sorrow in the human heart\r\nthat was beating under it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Villain!” cried Mr. Pyncheon, shaking his clenched fist at Maule.\r\n“You and the fiend together have robbed me of my daughter. Give her back,\r\nspawn of the old wizard, or you shall climb Gallows Hill in your\r\ngrandfather’s footsteps!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Softly, Mr. Pyncheon!” said the carpenter with scornful composure.\r\n“Softly, an’ it please your worship, else you will spoil those rich\r\nlace-ruffles at your wrists! Is it my crime if you have sold your daughter for\r\nthe mere hope of getting a sheet of yellow parchment into your clutch? There\r\nsits Mistress Alice quietly asleep. Now let Matthew Maule try whether she be as\r\nproud as the carpenter found her awhile since.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke, and Alice responded, with a soft, subdued, inward acquiescence, and a\r\nbending of her form towards him, like the flame of a torch when it indicates a\r\ngentle draught of air. He beckoned with his hand, and, rising from her\r\nchair,—blindly, but undoubtingly, as tending to her sure and inevitable\r\ncentre,—the proud Alice approached him. He waved her back, and,\r\nretreating, Alice sank again into her seat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She is mine!” said Matthew Maule. “Mine, by the right of the\r\nstrongest spirit!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the further progress of the legend, there is a long, grotesque, and\r\noccasionally awe-striking account of the carpenter’s incantations (if so\r\nthey are to be called), with a view of discovering the lost document. It\r\nappears to have been his object to convert the mind of Alice into a kind of\r\ntelescopic medium, through which Mr. Pyncheon and himself might obtain a\r\nglimpse into the spiritual world. He succeeded, accordingly, in holding an\r\nimperfect sort of intercourse, at one remove, with the departed personages in\r\nwhose custody the so much valued secret had been carried beyond the precincts\r\nof earth. During her trance, Alice described three figures as being present to\r\nher spiritualized perception. One was an aged, dignified, stern-looking\r\ngentleman, clad as for a solemn festival in grave and costly attire, but with a\r\ngreat blood-stain on his richly wrought band; the second, an aged man, meanly\r\ndressed, with a dark and malign countenance, and a broken halter about his\r\nneck; the third, a person not so advanced in life as the former two, but beyond\r\nthe middle age, wearing a coarse woollen tunic and leather breeches, and with a\r\ncarpenter’s rule sticking out of his side pocket. These three visionary\r\ncharacters possessed a mutual knowledge of the missing document. One of them,\r\nin truth,—it was he with the blood-stain on his band,—seemed,\r\nunless his gestures were misunderstood, to hold the parchment in his immediate\r\nkeeping, but was prevented by his two partners in the mystery from disburdening\r\nhimself of the trust. Finally, when he showed a purpose of shouting forth the\r\nsecret loudly enough to be heard from his own sphere into that of mortals, his\r\ncompanions struggled with him, and pressed their hands over his mouth; and\r\nforthwith—whether that he were choked by it, or that the secret itself\r\nwas of a crimson hue—there was a fresh flow of blood upon his band. Upon\r\nthis, the two meanly dressed figures mocked and jeered at the much-abashed old\r\ndignitary, and pointed their fingers at the stain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt this juncture, Maule turned to Mr. Pyncheon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It will never be allowed,” said he. “The custody of this\r\nsecret, that would so enrich his heirs, makes part of your grandfather’s\r\nretribution. He must choke with it until it is no longer of any value. And keep\r\nyou the House of the Seven Gables! It is too dear bought an inheritance, and\r\ntoo heavy with the curse upon it, to be shifted yet awhile from the\r\nColonel’s posterity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Pyncheon tried to speak, but—what with fear and passion—could\r\nmake only a gurgling murmur in his throat. The carpenter smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Aha, worshipful sir!—so you have old Maule’s blood to\r\ndrink!” said he jeeringly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Fiend in man’s shape! why dost thou keep dominion over my\r\nchild?” cried Mr. Pyncheon, when his choked utterance could make way.\r\n“Give me back my daughter. Then go thy ways; and may we never meet\r\nagain!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your daughter!” said Matthew Maule. “Why, she is fairly\r\nmine! Nevertheless, not to be too hard with fair Mistress Alice, I will leave\r\nher in your keeping; but I do not warrant you that she shall never have\r\noccasion to remember Maule, the carpenter.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe waved his hands with an upward motion; and, after a few repetitions of\r\nsimilar gestures, the beautiful Alice Pyncheon awoke from her strange trance.\r\nShe awoke without the slightest recollection of her visionary experience; but\r\nas one losing herself in a momentary reverie, and returning to the\r\nconsciousness of actual life, in almost as brief an interval as the\r\ndown-sinking flame of the hearth should quiver again up the chimney. On\r\nrecognizing Matthew Maule, she assumed an air of somewhat cold but gentle\r\ndignity, the rather, as there was a certain peculiar smile on the\r\ncarpenter’s visage that stirred the native pride of the fair Alice. So\r\nended, for that time, the quest for the lost title-deed of the Pyncheon\r\nterritory at the Eastward; nor, though often subsequently renewed, has it ever\r\nyet befallen a Pyncheon to set his eye upon that parchment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, alas for the beautiful, the gentle, yet too haughty Alice! A power that\r\nshe little dreamed of had laid its grasp upon her maiden soul. A will, most\r\nunlike her own, constrained her to do its grotesque and fantastic bidding. Her\r\nfather as it proved, had martyred his poor child to an inordinate desire for\r\nmeasuring his land by miles instead of acres. And, therefore, while Alice\r\nPyncheon lived, she was Maule’s slave, in a bondage more humiliating, a\r\nthousand-fold, than that which binds its chain around the body. Seated by his\r\nhumble fireside, Maule had but to wave his hand; and, wherever the proud lady\r\nchanced to be,—whether in her chamber, or entertaining her father’s\r\nstately guests, or worshipping at church,—whatever her place or\r\noccupation, her spirit passed from beneath her own control, and bowed itself to\r\nMaule. “Alice, laugh!”—the carpenter, beside his hearth,\r\nwould say; or perhaps intensely will it, without a spoken word. And, even were\r\nit prayer-time, or at a funeral, Alice must break into wild laughter.\r\n“Alice, be sad!”—and, at the instant, down would come her\r\ntears, quenching all the mirth of those around her like sudden rain upon a\r\nbonfire. “Alice, dance.”—and dance she would, not in such\r\ncourt-like measures as she had learned abroad, but some high-paced jig, or\r\nhop-skip rigadoon, befitting the brisk lasses at a rustic merry-making. It\r\nseemed to be Maule’s impulse, not to ruin Alice, nor to visit her with\r\nany black or gigantic mischief, which would have crowned her sorrows with the\r\ngrace of tragedy, but to wreak a low, ungenerous scorn upon her. Thus all the\r\ndignity of life was lost. She felt herself too much abased, and longed to\r\nchange natures with some worm!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne evening, at a bridal party (but not her own; for, so lost from\r\nself-control, she would have deemed it sin to marry), poor Alice was beckoned\r\nforth by her unseen despot, and constrained, in her gossamer white dress and\r\nsatin slippers, to hasten along the street to the mean dwelling of a\r\nlaboring-man. There was laughter and good cheer within; for Matthew Maule, that\r\nnight, was to wed the laborer’s daughter, and had summoned proud Alice\r\nPyncheon to wait upon his bride. And so she did; and when the twain were one,\r\nAlice awoke out of her enchanted sleep. Yet, no longer proud,—humbly, and\r\nwith a smile all steeped in sadness,—she kissed Maule’s wife, and\r\nwent her way. It was an inclement night; the southeast wind drove the mingled\r\nsnow and rain into her thinly sheltered bosom; her satin slippers were wet\r\nthrough and through, as she trod the muddy sidewalks. The next day a cold;\r\nsoon, a settled cough; anon, a hectic cheek, a wasted form, that sat beside the\r\nharpsichord, and filled the house with music! Music in which a strain of the\r\nheavenly choristers was echoed! Oh; joy! For Alice had borne her last\r\nhumiliation! Oh, greater joy! For Alice was penitent of her one earthly sin,\r\nand proud no more!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Pyncheons made a great funeral for Alice. The kith and kin were there, and\r\nthe whole respectability of the town besides. But, last in the procession, came\r\nMatthew Maule, gnashing his teeth, as if he would have bitten his own heart in\r\ntwain,—the darkest and wofullest man that ever walked behind a corpse! He\r\nmeant to humble Alice, not to kill her; but he had taken a woman’s\r\ndelicate soul into his rude gripe, to play with—and she was dead!\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap14\"></a>XIV.<br>\r\nPhœbe’s Good-Bye</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nHolgrave, plunging into his tale with the energy and absorption natural to a\r\nyoung author, had given a good deal of action to the parts capable of being\r\ndeveloped and exemplified in that manner. He now observed that a certain\r\nremarkable drowsiness (wholly unlike that with which the reader possibly feels\r\nhimself affected) had been flung over the senses of his auditress. It was the\r\neffect, unquestionably, of the mystic gesticulations by which he had sought to\r\nbring bodily before Phœbe’s perception the figure of the mesmerizing\r\ncarpenter. With the lids drooping over her eyes,—now lifted for an\r\ninstant, and drawn down again as with leaden weights,—she leaned slightly\r\ntowards him, and seemed almost to regulate her breath by his. Holgrave gazed at\r\nher, as he rolled up his manuscript, and recognized an incipient stage of that\r\ncurious psychological condition which, as he had himself told Phœbe, he\r\npossessed more than an ordinary faculty of producing. A veil was beginning to\r\nbe muffled about her, in which she could behold only him, and live only in his\r\nthoughts and emotions. His glance, as he fastened it on the young girl, grew\r\ninvoluntarily more concentrated; in his attitude there was the consciousness of\r\npower, investing his hardly mature figure with a dignity that did not belong to\r\nits physical manifestation. It was evident, that, with but one wave of his hand\r\nand a corresponding effort of his will, he could complete his mastery over\r\nPhœbe’s yet free and virgin spirit: he could establish an influence over\r\nthis good, pure, and simple child, as dangerous, and perhaps as disastrous, as\r\nthat which the carpenter of his legend had acquired and exercised over the\r\nill-fated Alice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo a disposition like Holgrave’s, at once speculative and active, there\r\nis no temptation so great as the opportunity of acquiring empire over the human\r\nspirit; nor any idea more seductive to a young man than to become the arbiter\r\nof a young girl’s destiny. Let us, therefore,—whatever his defects\r\nof nature and education, and in spite of his scorn for creeds and\r\ninstitutions,—concede to the daguerreotypist the rare and high quality of\r\nreverence for another’s individuality. Let us allow him integrity, also,\r\nforever after to be confided in; since he forbade himself to twine that one\r\nlink more which might have rendered his spell over Phœbe indissoluble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe made a slight gesture upward with his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You really mortify me, my dear Miss Phœbe!” he exclaimed, smiling\r\nhalf-sarcastically at her. “My poor story, it is but too evident, will\r\nnever do for Godey or Graham! Only think of your falling asleep at what I hoped\r\nthe newspaper critics would pronounce a most brilliant, powerful, imaginative,\r\npathetic, and original winding up! Well, the manuscript must serve to light\r\nlamps with;—if, indeed, being so imbued with my gentle dulness, it is any\r\nlonger capable of flame!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Me asleep! How can you say so?” answered Phœbe, as unconscious of\r\nthe crisis through which she had passed as an infant of the precipice to the\r\nverge of which it has rolled. “No, no! I consider myself as having been\r\nvery attentive; and, though I don’t remember the incidents quite\r\ndistinctly, yet I have an impression of a vast deal of trouble and\r\ncalamity,—so, no doubt, the story will prove exceedingly\r\nattractive.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time the sun had gone down, and was tinting the clouds towards the\r\nzenith with those bright hues which are not seen there until some time after\r\nsunset, and when the horizon has quite lost its richer brilliancy. The moon,\r\ntoo, which had long been climbing overhead, and unobtrusively melting its disk\r\ninto the azure,—like an ambitious demagogue, who hides his aspiring\r\npurpose by assuming the prevalent hue of popular sentiment,—now began to\r\nshine out, broad and oval, in its middle pathway. These silvery beams were\r\nalready powerful enough to change the character of the lingering daylight. They\r\nsoftened and embellished the aspect of the old house; although the shadows fell\r\ndeeper into the angles of its many gables, and lay brooding under the\r\nprojecting story, and within the half-open door. With the lapse of every\r\nmoment, the garden grew more picturesque; the fruit-trees, shrubbery, and\r\nflower-bushes had a dark obscurity among them. The commonplace\r\ncharacteristics—which, at noontide, it seemed to have taken a century of\r\nsordid life to accumulate—were now transfigured by a charm of romance. A\r\nhundred mysterious years were whispering among the leaves, whenever the slight\r\nsea-breeze found its way thither and stirred them. Through the foliage that\r\nroofed the little summer-house the moonlight flickered to and fro, and fell\r\nsilvery white on the dark floor, the table, and the circular bench, with a\r\ncontinual shift and play, according as the chinks and wayward crevices among\r\nthe twigs admitted or shut out the glimmer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo sweetly cool was the atmosphere, after all the feverish day, that the summer\r\neve might be fancied as sprinkling dews and liquid moonlight, with a dash of\r\nicy temper in them, out of a silver vase. Here and there, a few drops of this\r\nfreshness were scattered on a human heart, and gave it youth again, and\r\nsympathy with the eternal youth of nature. The artist chanced to be one on whom\r\nthe reviving influence fell. It made him feel—what he sometimes almost\r\nforgot, thrust so early as he had been into the rude struggle of man with\r\nman—how youthful he still was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It seems to me,” he observed, “that I never watched the\r\ncoming of so beautiful an eve, and never felt anything so very much like\r\nhappiness as at this moment. After all, what a good world we live in! How good,\r\nand beautiful! How young it is, too, with nothing really rotten or age-worn in\r\nit! This old house, for example, which sometimes has positively oppressed my\r\nbreath with its smell of decaying timber! And this garden, where the black\r\nmould always clings to my spade, as if I were a sexton delving in a graveyard!\r\nCould I keep the feeling that now possesses me, the garden would every day be\r\nvirgin soil, with the earth’s first freshness in the flavor of its beans\r\nand squashes; and the house!—it would be like a bower in Eden, blossoming\r\nwith the earliest roses that God ever made. Moonlight, and the sentiment in\r\nman’s heart responsive to it, are the greatest of renovators and\r\nreformers. And all other reform and renovation, I suppose, will prove to be no\r\nbetter than moonshine!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have been happier than I am now; at least, much gayer,” said\r\nPhœbe thoughtfully. “Yet I am sensible of a great charm in this\r\nbrightening moonlight; and I love to watch how the day, tired as it is, lags\r\naway reluctantly, and hates to be called yesterday so soon. I never cared much\r\nabout moonlight before. What is there, I wonder, so beautiful in it,\r\nto-night?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And you have never felt it before?” inquired the artist, looking\r\nearnestly at the girl through the twilight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never,” answered Phœbe; “and life does not look the same,\r\nnow that I have felt it so. It seems as if I had looked at everything,\r\nhitherto, in broad daylight, or else in the ruddy light of a cheerful fire,\r\nglimmering and dancing through a room. Ah, poor me!” she added, with a\r\nhalf-melancholy laugh. “I shall never be so merry as before I knew Cousin\r\nHepzibah and poor Cousin Clifford. I have grown a great deal older, in this\r\nlittle time. Older, and, I hope, wiser, and,—not exactly\r\nsadder,—but, certainly, with not half so much lightness in my spirits! I\r\nhave given them my sunshine, and have been glad to give it; but, of course, I\r\ncannot both give and keep it. They are welcome, notwithstanding!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have lost nothing, Phœbe, worth keeping, nor which it was possible\r\nto keep,” said Holgrave after a pause. “Our first youth is of no\r\nvalue; for we are never conscious of it until after it is gone. But\r\nsometimes—always, I suspect, unless one is exceedingly\r\nunfortunate—there comes a sense of second youth, gushing out of the\r\nheart’s joy at being in love; or, possibly, it may come to crown some\r\nother grand festival in life, if any other such there be. This bemoaning of\r\none’s self (as you do now) over the first, careless, shallow gayety of\r\nyouth departed, and this profound happiness at youth regained,—so much\r\ndeeper and richer than that we lost,—are essential to the soul’s\r\ndevelopment. In some cases, the two states come almost simultaneously, and\r\nmingle the sadness and the rapture in one mysterious emotion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hardly think I understand you,” said Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No wonder,” replied Holgrave, smiling; “for I have told you\r\na secret which I hardly began to know before I found myself giving it\r\nutterance. Remember it, however; and when the truth becomes clear to you, then\r\nthink of this moonlight scene!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is entirely moonlight now, except only a little flush of faint\r\ncrimson, upward from the west, between those buildings,” remarked Phœbe.\r\n“I must go in. Cousin Hepzibah is not quick at figures, and will give\r\nherself a headache over the day’s accounts, unless I help her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Holgrave detained her a little longer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Miss Hepzibah tells me,” observed he, “that you return to\r\nthe country in a few days.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, but only for a little while,” answered Phœbe; “for I\r\nlook upon this as my present home. I go to make a few arrangements, and to take\r\na more deliberate leave of my mother and friends. It is pleasant to live where\r\none is much desired and very useful; and I think I may have the satisfaction of\r\nfeeling myself so here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You surely may, and more than you imagine,” said the artist.\r\n“Whatever health, comfort, and natural life exists in the house is\r\nembodied in your person. These blessings came along with you, and will vanish\r\nwhen you leave the threshold. Miss Hepzibah, by secluding herself from society,\r\nhas lost all true relation with it, and is, in fact, dead; although she\r\ngalvanizes herself into a semblance of life, and stands behind her counter,\r\nafflicting the world with a greatly-to-be-deprecated scowl. Your poor cousin\r\nClifford is another dead and long-buried person, on whom the governor and\r\ncouncil have wrought a necromantic miracle. I should not wonder if he were to\r\ncrumble away, some morning, after you are gone, and nothing be seen of him\r\nmore, except a heap of dust. Miss Hepzibah, at any rate, will lose what little\r\nflexibility she has. They both exist by you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should be very sorry to think so,” answered Phœbe gravely.\r\n“But it is true that my small abilities were precisely what they needed;\r\nand I have a real interest in their welfare,—an odd kind of motherly\r\nsentiment,—which I wish you would not laugh at! And let me tell you\r\nfrankly, Mr. Holgrave, I am sometimes puzzled to know whether you wish them\r\nwell or ill.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Undoubtedly,” said the daguerreotypist, “I do feel an\r\ninterest in this antiquated, poverty-stricken old maiden lady, and this\r\ndegraded and shattered gentleman,—this abortive lover of the beautiful. A\r\nkindly interest, too, helpless old children that they are! But you have no\r\nconception what a different kind of heart mine is from your own. It is not my\r\nimpulse, as regards these two individuals, either to help or hinder; but to\r\nlook on, to analyze, to explain matters to myself, and to comprehend the drama\r\nwhich, for almost two hundred years, has been dragging its slow length over the\r\nground where you and I now tread. If permitted to witness the close, I doubt\r\nnot to derive a moral satisfaction from it, go matters how they may. There is a\r\nconviction within me that the end draws nigh. But, though Providence sent you\r\nhither to help, and sends me only as a privileged and meet spectator, I pledge\r\nmyself to lend these unfortunate beings whatever aid I can!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish you would speak more plainly,” cried Phœbe, perplexed and\r\ndispleased; “and, above all, that you would feel more like a Christian\r\nand a human being! How is it possible to see people in distress without\r\ndesiring, more than anything else, to help and comfort them? You talk as if\r\nthis old house were a theatre; and you seem to look at Hepzibah’s and\r\nClifford’s misfortunes, and those of generations before them, as a\r\ntragedy, such as I have seen acted in the hall of a country hotel, only the\r\npresent one appears to be played exclusively for your amusement. I do not like\r\nthis. The play costs the performers too much, and the audience is too\r\ncold-hearted.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are severe,” said Holgrave, compelled to recognize a degree of\r\ntruth in the piquant sketch of his own mood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And then,” continued Phœbe, “what can you mean by your\r\nconviction, which you tell me of, that the end is drawing near? Do you know of\r\nany new trouble hanging over my poor relatives? If so, tell me at once, and I\r\nwill not leave them!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Forgive me, Phœbe!” said the daguerreotypist, holding out his\r\nhand, to which the girl was constrained to yield her own. “I am somewhat\r\nof a mystic, it must be confessed. The tendency is in my blood, together with\r\nthe faculty of mesmerism, which might have brought me to Gallows Hill, in the\r\ngood old times of witchcraft. Believe me, if I were really aware of any secret,\r\nthe disclosure of which would benefit your friends,—who are my own\r\nfriends, likewise,—you should learn it before we part. But I have no such\r\nknowledge.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You hold something back!” said Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nothing,—no secrets but my own,” answered Holgrave. “I\r\ncan perceive, indeed, that Judge Pyncheon still keeps his eye on Clifford, in\r\nwhose ruin he had so large a share. His motives and intentions, however are a\r\nmystery to me. He is a determined and relentless man, with the genuine\r\ncharacter of an inquisitor; and had he any object to gain by putting Clifford\r\nto the rack, I verily believe that he would wrench his joints from their\r\nsockets, in order to accomplish it. But, so wealthy and eminent as he\r\nis,—so powerful in his own strength, and in the support of society on all\r\nsides,—what can Judge Pyncheon have to hope or fear from the imbecile,\r\nbranded, half-torpid Clifford?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yet,” urged Phœbe, “you did speak as if misfortune were\r\nimpending!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, that was because I am morbid!” replied the artist. “My\r\nmind has a twist aside, like almost everybody’s mind, except your own.\r\nMoreover, it is so strange to find myself an inmate of this old Pyncheon House,\r\nand sitting in this old garden—(hark, how Maule’s well is\r\nmurmuring!)—that, were it only for this one circumstance, I cannot help\r\nfancying that Destiny is arranging its fifth act for a catastrophe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There!” cried Phœbe with renewed vexation; for she was by nature\r\nas hostile to mystery as the sunshine to a dark corner. “You puzzle me\r\nmore than ever!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then let us part friends!” said Holgrave, pressing her hand.\r\n“Or, if not friends, let us part before you entirely hate me. You, who\r\nlove everybody else in the world!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good-by, then,” said Phœbe frankly. “I do not mean to be\r\nangry a great while, and should be sorry to have you think so. There has Cousin\r\nHepzibah been standing in the shadow of the doorway, this quarter of an hour\r\npast! She thinks I stay too long in the damp garden. So, good-night, and\r\ngood-by.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the second morning thereafter, Phœbe might have been seen, in her straw\r\nbonnet, with a shawl on one arm and a little carpet-bag on the other, bidding\r\nadieu to Hepzibah and Cousin Clifford. She was to take a seat in the next train\r\nof cars, which would transport her to within half a dozen miles of her country\r\nvillage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tears were in Phœbe’s eyes; a smile, dewy with affectionate regret,\r\nwas glimmering around her pleasant mouth. She wondered how it came to pass,\r\nthat her life of a few weeks, here in this heavy-hearted old mansion, had taken\r\nsuch hold of her, and so melted into her associations, as now to seem a more\r\nimportant centre-point of remembrance than all which had gone before. How had\r\nHepzibah—grim, silent, and irresponsive to her overflow of cordial\r\nsentiment—contrived to win so much love? And Clifford,—in his\r\nabortive decay, with the mystery of fearful crime upon him, and the close\r\nprison-atmosphere yet lurking in his breath,—how had he transformed\r\nhimself into the simplest child, whom Phœbe felt bound to watch over, and be,\r\nas it were, the providence of his unconsidered hours! Everything, at that\r\ninstant of farewell, stood out prominently to her view. Look where she would,\r\nlay her hand on what she might, the object responded to her consciousness, as\r\nif a moist human heart were in it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe peeped from the window into the garden, and felt herself more regretful at\r\nleaving this spot of black earth, vitiated with such an age-long growth of\r\nweeds, than joyful at the idea of again scenting her pine forests and fresh\r\nclover-fields. She called Chanticleer, his two wives, and the venerable\r\nchicken, and threw them some crumbs of bread from the breakfast-table. These\r\nbeing hastily gobbled up, the chicken spread its wings, and alighted close by\r\nPhœbe on the window-sill, where it looked gravely into her face and vented its\r\nemotions in a croak. Phœbe bade it be a good old chicken during her absence,\r\nand promised to bring it a little bag of buckwheat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Phœbe!” remarked Hepzibah, “you do not smile so\r\nnaturally as when you came to us! Then, the smile chose to shine out; now, you\r\nchoose it should. It is well that you are going back, for a little while, into\r\nyour native air. There has been too much weight on your spirits. The house is\r\ntoo gloomy and lonesome; the shop is full of vexations; and as for me, I have\r\nno faculty of making things look brighter than they are. Dear Clifford has been\r\nyour only comfort!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come hither, Phœbe,” suddenly cried her cousin Clifford, who had\r\nsaid very little all the morning. “Close!—closer!—and look me\r\nin the face!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe put one of her small hands on each elbow of his chair, and leaned her\r\nface towards him, so that he might peruse it as carefully as he would. It is\r\nprobable that the latent emotions of this parting hour had revived, in some\r\ndegree, his bedimmed and enfeebled faculties. At any rate, Phœbe soon felt\r\nthat, if not the profound insight of a seer, yet a more than feminine delicacy\r\nof appreciation, was making her heart the subject of its regard. A moment\r\nbefore, she had known nothing which she would have sought to hide. Now, as if\r\nsome secret were hinted to her own consciousness through the medium of\r\nanother’s perception, she was fain to let her eyelids droop beneath\r\nClifford’s gaze. A blush, too,—the redder, because she strove hard\r\nto keep it down,—ascended bigger and higher, in a tide of fitful\r\nprogress, until even her brow was all suffused with it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is enough, Phœbe,” said Clifford, with a melancholy smile.\r\n“When I first saw you, you were the prettiest little maiden in the world;\r\nand now you have deepened into beauty. Girlhood has passed into womanhood; the\r\nbud is a bloom! Go, now—I feel lonelier than I did.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe took leave of the desolate couple, and passed through the shop,\r\ntwinkling her eyelids to shake off a dew-drop; for—considering how brief\r\nher absence was to be, and therefore the folly of being cast down about\r\nit—she would not so far acknowledge her tears as to dry them with her\r\nhandkerchief. On the doorstep, she met the little urchin whose marvellous feats\r\nof gastronomy have been recorded in the earlier pages of our narrative. She\r\ntook from the window some specimen or other of natural history,—her eyes\r\nbeing too dim with moisture to inform her accurately whether it was a rabbit or\r\na hippopotamus,—put it into the child’s hand as a parting gift, and\r\nwent her way. Old Uncle Venner was just coming out of his door, with a\r\nwood-horse and saw on his shoulder; and, trudging along the street, he scrupled\r\nnot to keep company with Phœbe, so far as their paths lay together; nor, in\r\nspite of his patched coat and rusty beaver, and the curious fashion of his\r\ntow-cloth trousers, could she find it in her heart to outwalk him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We shall miss you, next Sabbath afternoon,” observed the street\r\nphilosopher. “It is unaccountable how little while it takes some folks to\r\ngrow just as natural to a man as his own breath; and, begging your pardon, Miss\r\nPhœbe (though there can be no offence in an old man’s saying it),\r\nthat’s just what you’ve grown to me! My years have been a great\r\nmany, and your life is but just beginning; and yet, you are somehow as familiar\r\nto me as if I had found you at my mother’s door, and you had blossomed,\r\nlike a running vine, all along my pathway since. Come back soon, or I shall be\r\ngone to my farm; for I begin to find these wood-sawing jobs a little too tough\r\nfor my back-ache.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very soon, Uncle Venner,” replied Phœbe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And let it be all the sooner, Phœbe, for the sake of those poor souls\r\nyonder,” continued her companion. “They can never do without you,\r\nnow,—never, Phœbe; never—no more than if one of God’s angels\r\nhad been living with them, and making their dismal house pleasant and\r\ncomfortable! Don’t it seem to you they’d be in a sad case, if, some\r\npleasant summer morning like this, the angel should spread his wings, and fly\r\nto the place he came from? Well, just so they feel, now that you’re going\r\nhome by the railroad! They can’t bear it, Miss Phœbe; so be sure to come\r\nback!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am no angel, Uncle Venner,” said Phœbe, smiling, as she offered\r\nhim her hand at the street-corner. “But, I suppose, people never feel so\r\nmuch like angels as when they are doing what little good they may. So I shall\r\ncertainly come back!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus parted the old man and the rosy girl; and Phœbe took the wings of the\r\nmorning, and was soon flitting almost as rapidly away as if endowed with the\r\naerial locomotion of the angels to whom Uncle Venner had so graciously compared\r\nher.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap15\"></a>XV.<br>\r\nThe Scowl and Smile</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral days passed over the Seven Gables, heavily and drearily enough. In fact\r\n(not to attribute the whole gloom of sky and earth to the one inauspicious\r\ncircumstance of Phœbe’s departure), an easterly storm had set in, and\r\nindefatigably apply itself to the task of making the black roof and walls of\r\nthe old house look more cheerless than ever before. Yet was the outside not\r\nhalf so cheerless as the interior. Poor Clifford was cut off, at once, from all\r\nhis scanty resources of enjoyment. Phœbe was not there; nor did the sunshine\r\nfall upon the floor. The garden, with its muddy walks, and the chill, dripping\r\nfoliage of its summer-house, was an image to be shuddered at. Nothing\r\nflourished in the cold, moist, pitiless atmosphere, drifting with the brackish\r\nscud of sea-breezes, except the moss along the joints of the shingle-roof, and\r\nthe great bunch of weeds, that had lately been suffering from drought, in the\r\nangle between the two front gables.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs for Hepzibah, she seemed not merely possessed with the east wind, but to be,\r\nin her very person, only another phase of this gray and sullen spell of\r\nweather; the East-Wind itself, grim and disconsolate, in a rusty black silk\r\ngown, and with a turban of cloud-wreaths on its head. The custom of the shop\r\nfell off, because a story got abroad that she soured her small beer and other\r\ndamageable commodities, by scowling on them. It is, perhaps, true that the\r\npublic had something reasonably to complain of in her deportment; but towards\r\nClifford she was neither ill-tempered nor unkind, nor felt less warmth of heart\r\nthan always, had it been possible to make it reach him. The inutility of her\r\nbest efforts, however, palsied the poor old gentlewoman. She could do little\r\nelse than sit silently in a corner of the room, when the wet pear-tree\r\nbranches, sweeping across the small windows, created a noonday dusk, which\r\nHepzibah unconsciously darkened with her woe-begone aspect. It was no fault of\r\nHepzibah’s. Everything—even the old chairs and tables, that had\r\nknown what weather was for three or four such lifetimes as her own—looked\r\nas damp and chill as if the present were their worst experience. The picture of\r\nthe Puritan Colonel shivered on the wall. The house itself shivered, from every\r\nattic of its seven gables down to the great kitchen fireplace, which served all\r\nthe better as an emblem of the mansion’s heart, because, though built for\r\nwarmth, it was now so comfortless and empty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah attempted to enliven matters by a fire in the parlor. But the storm\r\ndemon kept watch above, and, whenever a flame was kindled, drove the smoke back\r\nagain, choking the chimney’s sooty throat with its own breath.\r\nNevertheless, during four days of this miserable storm, Clifford wrapt himself\r\nin an old cloak, and occupied his customary chair. On the morning of the fifth,\r\nwhen summoned to breakfast, he responded only by a broken-hearted murmur,\r\nexpressive of a determination not to leave his bed. His sister made no attempt\r\nto change his purpose. In fact, entirely as she loved him, Hepzibah could\r\nhardly have borne any longer the wretched duty—so impracticable by her\r\nfew and rigid faculties—of seeking pastime for a still sensitive, but\r\nruined mind, critical and fastidious, without force or volition. It was at\r\nleast something short of positive despair, that to-day she might sit shivering\r\nalone, and not suffer continually a new grief, and unreasonable pang of\r\nremorse, at every fitful sigh of her fellow sufferer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Clifford, it seemed, though he did not make his appearance below stairs,\r\nhad, after all, bestirred himself in quest of amusement. In the course of the\r\nforenoon, Hepzibah heard a note of music, which (there being no other tuneful\r\ncontrivance in the House of the Seven Gables) she knew must proceed from Alice\r\nPyncheon’s harpsichord. She was aware that Clifford, in his youth, had\r\npossessed a cultivated taste for music, and a considerable degree of skill in\r\nits practice. It was difficult, however, to conceive of his retaining an\r\naccomplishment to which daily exercise is so essential, in the measure\r\nindicated by the sweet, airy, and delicate, though most melancholy strain, that\r\nnow stole upon her ear. Nor was it less marvellous that the long-silent\r\ninstrument should be capable of so much melody. Hepzibah involuntarily thought\r\nof the ghostly harmonies, prelusive of death in the family, which were\r\nattributed to the legendary Alice. But it was, perhaps, proof of the agency of\r\nother than spiritual fingers, that, after a few touches, the chords seemed to\r\nsnap asunder with their own vibrations, and the music ceased.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut a harsher sound succeeded to the mysterious notes; nor was the easterly day\r\nfated to pass without an event sufficient in itself to poison, for Hepzibah and\r\nClifford, the balmiest air that ever brought the humming-birds along with it.\r\nThe final echoes of Alice Pyncheon’s performance (or Clifford’s, if\r\nhis we must consider it) were driven away by no less vulgar a dissonance than\r\nthe ringing of the shop-bell. A foot was heard scraping itself on the\r\nthreshold, and thence somewhat ponderously stepping on the floor. Hepzibah\r\ndelayed a moment, while muffling herself in a faded shawl, which had been her\r\ndefensive armor in a forty years’ warfare against the east wind. A\r\ncharacteristic sound, however,—neither a cough nor a hem, but a kind of\r\nrumbling and reverberating spasm in somebody’s capacious depth of\r\nchest;—impelled her to hurry forward, with that aspect of fierce\r\nfaint-heartedness so common to women in cases of perilous emergency. Few of her\r\nsex, on such occasions, have ever looked so terrible as our poor scowling\r\nHepzibah. But the visitor quietly closed the shop-door behind him, stood up his\r\numbrella against the counter, and turned a visage of composed benignity, to\r\nmeet the alarm and anger which his appearance had excited.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah’s presentiment had not deceived her. It was no other than Judge\r\nPyncheon, who, after in vain trying the front door, had now effected his\r\nentrance into the shop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How do you do, Cousin Hepzibah?—and how does this most inclement\r\nweather affect our poor Clifford?” began the Judge; and wonderful it\r\nseemed, indeed, that the easterly storm was not put to shame, or, at any rate,\r\na little mollified, by the genial benevolence of his smile. “I could not\r\nrest without calling to ask, once more, whether I can in any manner promote his\r\ncomfort, or your own.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You can do nothing,” said Hepzibah, controlling her agitation as\r\nwell as she could. “I devote myself to Clifford. He has every comfort\r\nwhich his situation admits of.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But allow me to suggest, dear cousin,” rejoined the Judge,\r\n“you err,—in all affection and kindness, no doubt, and with the\r\nvery best intentions,—but you do err, nevertheless, in keeping your\r\nbrother so secluded. Why insulate him thus from all sympathy and kindness?\r\nClifford, alas! has had too much of solitude. Now let him try\r\nsociety,—the society, that is to say, of kindred and old friends. Let me,\r\nfor instance, but see Clifford, and I will answer for the good effect of the\r\ninterview.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You cannot see him,” answered Hepzibah. “Clifford has kept\r\nhis bed since yesterday.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What! How! Is he ill?” exclaimed Judge Pyncheon, starting with\r\nwhat seemed to be angry alarm; for the very frown of the old Puritan darkened\r\nthrough the room as he spoke. “Nay, then, I must and will see him! What\r\nif he should die?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is in no danger of death,” said Hepzibah,—and added, with\r\nbitterness that she could repress no longer, “none; unless he shall be\r\npersecuted to death, now, by the same man who long ago attempted it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Cousin Hepzibah,” said the Judge, with an impressive earnestness\r\nof manner, which grew even to tearful pathos as he proceeded, “is it\r\npossible that you do not perceive how unjust, how unkind, how unchristian, is\r\nthis constant, this long-continued bitterness against me, for a part which I\r\nwas constrained by duty and conscience, by the force of law, and at my own\r\nperil, to act? What did I do, in detriment to Clifford, which it was possible\r\nto leave undone? How could you, his sister,—if, for your never-ending\r\nsorrow, as it has been for mine, you had known what I did,—have, shown\r\ngreater tenderness? And do you think, cousin, that it has cost me no\r\npang?—that it has left no anguish in my bosom, from that day to this,\r\namidst all the prosperity with which Heaven has blessed me?—or that I do\r\nnot now rejoice, when it is deemed consistent with the dues of public justice\r\nand the welfare of society that this dear kinsman, this early friend, this\r\nnature so delicately and beautifully constituted,—so unfortunate, let us\r\npronounce him, and forbear to say, so guilty,—that our own Clifford, in\r\nfine, should be given back to life, and its possibilities of enjoyment? Ah, you\r\nlittle know me, Cousin Hepzibah! You little know this heart! It now throbs at\r\nthe thought of meeting him! There lives not the human being (except\r\nyourself,—and you not more than I) who has shed so many tears for\r\nClifford’s calamity. You behold some of them now. There is none who would\r\nso delight to promote his happiness! Try me, Hepzibah!—try me,\r\nCousin!—try the man whom you have treated as your enemy and\r\nClifford’s!—try Jaffrey Pyncheon, and you shall find him true, to\r\nthe heart’s core!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In the name of Heaven,” cried Hepzibah, provoked only to intenser\r\nindignation by this outgush of the inestimable tenderness of a stern\r\nnature,—“in God’s name, whom you insult, and whose power I\r\ncould almost question, since he hears you utter so many false words without\r\npalsying your tongue,—give over, I beseech you, this loathsome pretence\r\nof affection for your victim! You hate him! Say so, like a man! You cherish, at\r\nthis moment, some black purpose against him in your heart! Speak it out, at\r\nonce!—or, if you hope so to promote it better, hide it till you can\r\ntriumph in its success! But never speak again of your love for my poor brother.\r\nI cannot bear it! It will drive me beyond a woman’s decency! It will\r\ndrive me mad! Forbear! Not another word! It will make me spurn you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor once, Hepzibah’s wrath had given her courage. She had spoken. But,\r\nafter all, was this unconquerable distrust of Judge Pyncheon’s integrity,\r\nand this utter denial, apparently, of his claim to stand in the ring of human\r\nsympathies,—were they founded in any just perception of his character, or\r\nmerely the offspring of a woman’s unreasonable prejudice, deduced from\r\nnothing?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Judge, beyond all question, was a man of eminent respectability. The church\r\nacknowledged it; the state acknowledged it. It was denied by nobody. In all the\r\nvery extensive sphere of those who knew him, whether in his public or private\r\ncapacities, there was not an individual—except Hepzibah, and some lawless\r\nmystic, like the daguerreotypist, and, possibly, a few political\r\nopponents—who would have dreamed of seriously disputing his claim to a\r\nhigh and honorable place in the world’s regard. Nor (we must do him the\r\nfurther justice to say) did Judge Pyncheon himself, probably, entertain many or\r\nvery frequent doubts, that his enviable reputation accorded with his deserts.\r\nHis conscience, therefore, usually considered the surest witness to a\r\nman’s integrity,—his conscience, unless it might be for the little\r\nspace of five minutes in the twenty-four hours, or, now and then, some black\r\nday in the whole year’s circle,—his conscience bore an accordant\r\ntestimony with the world’s laudatory voice. And yet, strong as this\r\nevidence may seem to be, we should hesitate to peril our own conscience on the\r\nassertion, that the Judge and the consenting world were right, and that poor\r\nHepzibah with her solitary prejudice was wrong. Hidden from\r\nmankind,—forgotten by himself, or buried so deeply under a sculptured and\r\nornamented pile of ostentatious deeds that his daily life could take no note of\r\nit,—there may have lurked some evil and unsightly thing. Nay, we could\r\nalmost venture to say, further, that a daily guilt might have been acted by\r\nhim, continually renewed, and reddening forth afresh, like the miraculous\r\nblood-stain of a murder, without his necessarily and at every moment being\r\naware of it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMen of strong minds, great force of character, and a hard texture of the\r\nsensibilities, are very capable of falling into mistakes of this kind. They are\r\nordinarily men to whom forms are of paramount importance. Their field of action\r\nlies among the external phenomena of life. They possess vast ability in\r\ngrasping, and arranging, and appropriating to themselves, the big, heavy, solid\r\nunrealities, such as gold, landed estate, offices of trust and emolument, and\r\npublic honors. With these materials, and with deeds of goodly aspect, done in\r\nthe public eye, an individual of this class builds up, as it were, a tall and\r\nstately edifice, which, in the view of other people, and ultimately in his own\r\nview, is no other than the man’s character, or the man himself. Behold,\r\ntherefore, a palace! Its splendid halls and suites of spacious apartments are\r\nfloored with a mosaic-work of costly marbles; its windows, the whole height of\r\neach room, admit the sunshine through the most transparent of plate-glass; its\r\nhigh cornices are gilded, and its ceilings gorgeously painted; and a lofty\r\ndome—through which, from the central pavement, you may gaze up to the\r\nsky, as with no obstructing medium between—surmounts the whole. With what\r\nfairer and nobler emblem could any man desire to shadow forth his character?\r\nAh! but in some low and obscure nook,—some narrow closet on the\r\nground-floor, shut, locked and bolted, and the key flung away,—or beneath\r\nthe marble pavement, in a stagnant water-puddle, with the richest pattern of\r\nmosaic-work above,—may lie a corpse, half decayed, and still decaying,\r\nand diffusing its death-scent all through the palace! The inhabitant will not\r\nbe conscious of it, for it has long been his daily breath! Neither will the\r\nvisitors, for they smell only the rich odors which the master sedulously\r\nscatters through the palace, and the incense which they bring, and delight to\r\nburn before him! Now and then, perchance, comes in a seer, before whose sadly\r\ngifted eye the whole structure melts into thin air, leaving only the hidden\r\nnook, the bolted closet, with the cobwebs festooned over its forgotten door, or\r\nthe deadly hole under the pavement, and the decaying corpse within. Here, then,\r\nwe are to seek the true emblem of the man’s character, and of the deed\r\nthat gives whatever reality it possesses to his life. And, beneath the show of\r\na marble palace, that pool of stagnant water, foul with many impurities, and,\r\nperhaps, tinged with blood,—that secret abomination, above which,\r\npossibly, he may say his prayers, without remembering it,—is this\r\nman’s miserable soul!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo apply this train of remark somewhat more closely to Judge Pyncheon. We might\r\nsay (without in the least imputing crime to a personage of his eminent\r\nrespectability) that there was enough of splendid rubbish in his life to cover\r\nup and paralyze a more active and subtile conscience than the Judge was ever\r\ntroubled with. The purity of his judicial character, while on the bench; the\r\nfaithfulness of his public service in subsequent capacities; his devotedness to\r\nhis party, and the rigid consistency with which he had adhered to its\r\nprinciples, or, at all events, kept pace with its organized movements; his\r\nremarkable zeal as president of a Bible society; his unimpeachable integrity as\r\ntreasurer of a widow’s and orphan’s fund; his benefits to\r\nhorticulture, by producing two much esteemed varieties of the pear and to\r\nagriculture, through the agency of the famous Pyncheon bull; the cleanliness of\r\nhis moral deportment, for a great many years past; the severity with which he\r\nhad frowned upon, and finally cast off, an expensive and dissipated son,\r\ndelaying forgiveness until within the final quarter of an hour of the young\r\nman’s life; his prayers at morning and eventide, and graces at meal-time;\r\nhis efforts in furtherance of the temperance cause; his confining himself,\r\nsince the last attack of the gout, to five diurnal glasses of old sherry wine;\r\nthe snowy whiteness of his linen, the polish of his boots, the handsomeness of\r\nhis gold-headed cane, the square and roomy fashion of his coat, and the\r\nfineness of its material, and, in general, the studied propriety of his dress\r\nand equipment; the scrupulousness with which he paid public notice, in the\r\nstreet, by a bow, a lifting of the hat, a nod, or a motion of the hand, to all\r\nand sundry of his acquaintances, rich or poor; the smile of broad benevolence\r\nwherewith he made it a point to gladden the whole world,—what room could\r\npossibly be found for darker traits in a portrait made up of lineaments like\r\nthese? This proper face was what he beheld in the looking-glass. This admirably\r\narranged life was what he was conscious of in the progress of every day. Then\r\nmight not he claim to be its result and sum, and say to himself and the\r\ncommunity, “Behold Judge Pyncheon there”?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd allowing that, many, many years ago, in his early and reckless youth, he\r\nhad committed some one wrong act,—or that, even now, the inevitable force\r\nof circumstances should occasionally make him do one questionable deed among a\r\nthousand praiseworthy, or, at least, blameless ones,—would you\r\ncharacterize the Judge by that one necessary deed, and that half-forgotten act,\r\nand let it overshadow the fair aspect of a lifetime? What is there so ponderous\r\nin evil, that a thumb’s bigness of it should outweigh the mass of things\r\nnot evil which were heaped into the other scale! This scale and balance system\r\nis a favorite one with people of Judge Pyncheon’s brotherhood. A hard,\r\ncold man, thus unfortunately situated, seldom or never looking inward, and\r\nresolutely taking his idea of himself from what purports to be his image as\r\nreflected in the mirror of public opinion, can scarcely arrive at true\r\nself-knowledge, except through loss of property and reputation. Sickness will\r\nnot always help him do it; not always the death-hour!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut our affair now is with Judge Pyncheon as he stood confronting the fierce\r\noutbreak of Hepzibah’s wrath. Without premeditation, to her own surprise,\r\nand indeed terror, she had given vent, for once, to the inveteracy of her\r\nresentment, cherished against this kinsman for thirty years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus far the Judge’s countenance had expressed mild\r\nforbearance,—grave and almost gentle deprecation of his cousin’s\r\nunbecoming violence,—free and Christian-like forgiveness of the wrong\r\ninflicted by her words. But when those words were irrevocably spoken, his look\r\nassumed sternness, the sense of power, and immitigable resolve; and this with\r\nso natural and imperceptible a change, that it seemed as if the iron man had\r\nstood there from the first, and the meek man not at all. The effect was as when\r\nthe light, vapory clouds, with their soft coloring, suddenly vanish from the\r\nstony brow of a precipitous mountain, and leave there the frown which you at\r\nonce feel to be eternal. Hepzibah almost adopted the insane belief that it was\r\nher old Puritan ancestor, and not the modern Judge, on whom she had just been\r\nwreaking the bitterness of her heart. Never did a man show stronger proof of\r\nthe lineage attributed to him than Judge Pyncheon, at this crisis, by his\r\nunmistakable resemblance to the picture in the inner room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Cousin Hepzibah,” said he very calmly, “it is time to have\r\ndone with this.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“With all my heart!” answered she. “Then, why do you\r\npersecute us any longer? Leave poor Clifford and me in peace. Neither of us\r\ndesires anything better!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is my purpose to see Clifford before I leave this house,”\r\ncontinued the Judge. “Do not act like a madwoman, Hepzibah! I am his only\r\nfriend, and an all-powerful one. Has it never occurred to you,—are you so\r\nblind as not to have seen,—that, without not merely my consent, but my\r\nefforts, my representations, the exertion of my whole influence, political,\r\nofficial, personal, Clifford would never have been what you call free? Did you\r\nthink his release a triumph over me? Not so, my good cousin; not so, by any\r\nmeans! The furthest possible from that! No; but it was the accomplishment of a\r\npurpose long entertained on my part. I set him free!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You!” answered Hepzibah. “I never will believe it! He owed\r\nhis dungeon to you; his freedom to God’s providence!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I set him free!” reaffirmed Judge Pyncheon, with the calmest\r\ncomposure. “And I came hither now to decide whether he shall retain his\r\nfreedom. It will depend upon himself. For this purpose, I must see him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never!—it would drive him mad!” exclaimed Hepzibah, but with\r\nan irresoluteness sufficiently perceptible to the keen eye of the Judge; for,\r\nwithout the slightest faith in his good intentions, she knew not whether there\r\nwas most to dread in yielding or resistance. “And why should you wish to\r\nsee this wretched, broken man, who retains hardly a fraction of his intellect,\r\nand will hide even that from an eye which has no love in it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He shall see love enough in mine, if that be all!” said the Judge,\r\nwith well-grounded confidence in the benignity of his aspect. “But,\r\nCousin Hepzibah, you confess a great deal, and very much to the purpose. Now,\r\nlisten, and I will frankly explain my reasons for insisting on this interview.\r\nAt the death, thirty years since, of our uncle Jaffrey, it was found,—I\r\nknow not whether the circumstance ever attracted much of your attention, among\r\nthe sadder interests that clustered round that event,—but it was found\r\nthat his visible estate, of every kind, fell far short of any estimate ever\r\nmade of it. He was supposed to be immensely rich. Nobody doubted that he stood\r\namong the weightiest men of his day. It was one of his eccentricities,\r\nhowever,—and not altogether a folly, neither,—to conceal the amount\r\nof his property by making distant and foreign investments, perhaps under other\r\nnames than his own, and by various means, familiar enough to capitalists, but\r\nunnecessary here to be specified. By Uncle Jaffrey’s last will and\r\ntestament, as you are aware, his entire property was bequeathed to me, with the\r\nsingle exception of a life interest to yourself in this old family mansion, and\r\nthe strip of patrimonial estate remaining attached to it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And do you seek to deprive us of that?” asked Hepzibah, unable to\r\nrestrain her bitter contempt. “Is this your price for ceasing to\r\npersecute poor Clifford?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly not, my dear cousin!” answered the Judge, smiling\r\nbenevolently. “On the contrary, as you must do me the justice to own, I\r\nhave constantly expressed my readiness to double or treble your resources,\r\nwhenever you should make up your mind to accept any kindness of that nature at\r\nthe hands of your kinsman. No, no! But here lies the gist of the matter. Of my\r\nuncle’s unquestionably great estate, as I have said, not the\r\nhalf—no, not one third, as I am fully convinced—was apparent after\r\nhis death. Now, I have the best possible reasons for believing that your\r\nbrother Clifford can give me a clew to the recovery of the remainder.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford!—Clifford know of any hidden wealth? Clifford have it in\r\nhis power to make you rich?” cried the old gentlewoman, affected with a\r\nsense of something like ridicule at the idea. “Impossible! You deceive\r\nyourself! It is really a thing to laugh at!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is as certain as that I stand here!” said Judge Pyncheon,\r\nstriking his gold-headed cane on the floor, and at the same time stamping his\r\nfoot, as if to express his conviction the more forcibly by the whole emphasis\r\nof his substantial person. “Clifford told me so himself!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no!” exclaimed Hepzibah incredulously. “You are\r\ndreaming, Cousin Jaffrey.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not belong to the dreaming class of men,” said the Judge\r\nquietly. “Some months before my uncle’s death, Clifford boasted to\r\nme of the possession of the secret of incalculable wealth. His purpose was to\r\ntaunt me, and excite my curiosity. I know it well. But, from a pretty distinct\r\nrecollection of the particulars of our conversation, I am thoroughly convinced\r\nthat there was truth in what he said. Clifford, at this moment, if he\r\nchooses,—and choose he must!—can inform me where to find the\r\nschedule, the documents, the evidences, in whatever shape they exist, of the\r\nvast amount of Uncle Jaffrey’s missing property. He has the secret. His\r\nboast was no idle word. It had a directness, an emphasis, a particularity, that\r\nshowed a backbone of solid meaning within the mystery of his expression.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But what could have been Clifford’s object,” asked Hepzibah,\r\n“in concealing it so long?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was one of the bad impulses of our fallen nature,” replied the\r\nJudge, turning up his eyes. “He looked upon me as his enemy. He\r\nconsidered me as the cause of his overwhelming disgrace, his imminent peril of\r\ndeath, his irretrievable ruin. There was no great probability, therefore, of\r\nhis volunteering information, out of his dungeon, that should elevate me still\r\nhigher on the ladder of prosperity. But the moment has now come when he must\r\ngive up his secret.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And what if he should refuse?” inquired Hepzibah.\r\n“Or,—as I steadfastly believe,—what if he has no knowledge of\r\nthis wealth?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear cousin,” said Judge Pyncheon, with a quietude which he had\r\nthe power of making more formidable than any violence, “since your\r\nbrother’s return, I have taken the precaution (a highly proper one in the\r\nnear kinsman and natural guardian of an individual so situated) to have his\r\ndeportment and habits constantly and carefully overlooked. Your neighbors have\r\nbeen eye-witnesses to whatever has passed in the garden. The butcher, the\r\nbaker, the fish-monger, some of the customers of your shop, and many a prying\r\nold woman, have told me several of the secrets of your interior. A still larger\r\ncircle—I myself, among the rest—can testify to his extravagances at\r\nthe arched window. Thousands beheld him, a week or two ago, on the point of\r\nflinging himself thence into the street. From all this testimony, I am led to\r\napprehend—reluctantly, and with deep grief—that Clifford’s\r\nmisfortunes have so affected his intellect, never very strong, that he cannot\r\nsafely remain at large. The alternative, you must be aware,—and its\r\nadoption will depend entirely on the decision which I am now about to\r\nmake,—the alternative is his confinement, probably for the remainder of\r\nhis life, in a public asylum for persons in his unfortunate state of\r\nmind.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You cannot mean it!” shrieked Hepzibah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Should my cousin Clifford,” continued Judge Pyncheon, wholly\r\nundisturbed, “from mere malice, and hatred of one whose interests ought\r\nnaturally to be dear to him,—a mode of passion that, as often as any\r\nother, indicates mental disease,—should he refuse me the information so\r\nimportant to myself, and which he assuredly possesses, I shall consider it the\r\none needed jot of evidence to satisfy my mind of his insanity. And, once sure\r\nof the course pointed out by conscience, you know me too well, Cousin Hepzibah,\r\nto entertain a doubt that I shall pursue it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“O Jaffrey,—Cousin Jaffrey,” cried Hepzibah mournfully, not\r\npassionately, “it is you that are diseased in mind, not Clifford! You\r\nhave forgotten that a woman was your mother!—that you have had sisters,\r\nbrothers, children of your own!—or that there ever was affection between\r\nman and man, or pity from one man to another, in this miserable world! Else,\r\nhow could you have dreamed of this? You are not young, Cousin\r\nJaffrey!—no, nor middle-aged,—but already an old man! The hair is\r\nwhite upon your head! How many years have you to live? Are you not rich enough\r\nfor that little time? Shall you be hungry,—shall you lack clothes, or a\r\nroof to shelter you,—between this point and the grave? No! but, with the\r\nhalf of what you now possess, you could revel in costly food and wines, and\r\nbuild a house twice as splendid as you now inhabit, and make a far greater show\r\nto the world,—and yet leave riches to your only son, to make him bless\r\nthe hour of your death! Then, why should you do this cruel, cruel\r\nthing?—so mad a thing, that I know not whether to call it wicked! Alas,\r\nCousin Jaffrey, this hard and grasping spirit has run in our blood these two\r\nhundred years. You are but doing over again, in another shape, what your\r\nancestor before you did, and sending down to your posterity the curse inherited\r\nfrom him!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Talk sense, Hepzibah, for Heaven’s sake!” exclaimed the\r\nJudge, with the impatience natural to a reasonable man, on hearing anything so\r\nutterly absurd as the above, in a discussion about matters of business.\r\n“I have told you my determination. I am not apt to change. Clifford must\r\ngive up his secret, or take the consequences. And let him decide quickly; for I\r\nhave several affairs to attend to this morning, and an important dinner\r\nengagement with some political friends.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford has no secret!” answered Hepzibah. “And God will\r\nnot let you do the thing you meditate!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We shall see,” said the unmoved Judge. “Meanwhile, choose\r\nwhether you will summon Clifford, and allow this business to be amicably\r\nsettled by an interview between two kinsmen, or drive me to harsher measures,\r\nwhich I should be most happy to feel myself justified in avoiding. The\r\nresponsibility is altogether on your part.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are stronger than I,” said Hepzibah, after a brief\r\nconsideration; “and you have no pity in your strength! Clifford is not\r\nnow insane; but the interview which you insist upon may go far to make him so.\r\nNevertheless, knowing you as I do, I believe it to be my best course to allow\r\nyou to judge for yourself as to the improbability of his possessing any\r\nvaluable secret. I will call Clifford. Be merciful in your dealings with\r\nhim!—be far more merciful than your heart bids you be!—for God is\r\nlooking at you, Jaffrey Pyncheon!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Judge followed his cousin from the shop, where the foregoing conversation\r\nhad passed, into the parlor, and flung himself heavily into the great ancestral\r\nchair. Many a former Pyncheon had found repose in its capacious arms: rosy\r\nchildren, after their sports; young men, dreamy with love; grown men, weary\r\nwith cares; old men, burdened with winters,—they had mused, and\r\nslumbered, and departed to a yet profounder sleep. It had been a long\r\ntradition, though a doubtful one, that this was the very chair, seated in which\r\nthe earliest of the Judge’s New England forefathers—he whose\r\npicture still hung upon the wall—had given a dead man’s silent and\r\nstern reception to the throng of distinguished guests. From that hour of evil\r\nomen until the present, it may be,—though we know not the secret of his\r\nheart,—but it may be that no wearier and sadder man had ever sunk into\r\nthe chair than this same Judge Pyncheon, whom we have just beheld so\r\nimmitigably hard and resolute. Surely, it must have been at no slight cost that\r\nhe had thus fortified his soul with iron. Such calmness is a mightier effort\r\nthan the violence of weaker men. And there was yet a heavy task for him to do.\r\nWas it a little matter—a trifle to be prepared for in a single moment,\r\nand to be rested from in another moment,—that he must now, after thirty\r\nyears, encounter a kinsman risen from a living tomb, and wrench a secret from\r\nhim, or else consign him to a living tomb again?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Did you speak?” asked Hepzibah, looking in from the threshold of\r\nthe parlor; for she imagined that the Judge had uttered some sound which she\r\nwas anxious to interpret as a relenting impulse. “I thought you called me\r\nback.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no” gruffly answered Judge Pyncheon with a harsh frown, while\r\nhis brow grew almost a black purple, in the shadow of the room. “Why\r\nshould I call you back? Time flies! Bid Clifford come to me!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Judge had taken his watch from his vest pocket and now held it in his hand,\r\nmeasuring the interval which was to ensue before the appearance of Clifford.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap16\"></a>XVI.<br>\r\nClifford’s Chamber</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nNever had the old house appeared so dismal to poor Hepzibah as when she\r\ndeparted on that wretched errand. There was a strange aspect in it. As she\r\ntrode along the foot-worn passages, and opened one crazy door after another,\r\nand ascended the creaking staircase, she gazed wistfully and fearfully around.\r\nIt would have been no marvel, to her excited mind, if, behind or beside her,\r\nthere had been the rustle of dead people’s garments, or pale visages\r\nawaiting her on the landing-place above. Her nerves were set all ajar by the\r\nscene of passion and terror through which she had just struggled. Her colloquy\r\nwith Judge Pyncheon, who so perfectly represented the person and attributes of\r\nthe founder of the family, had called back the dreary past. It weighed upon her\r\nheart. Whatever she had heard, from legendary aunts and grandmothers,\r\nconcerning the good or evil fortunes of the Pyncheons,—stories which had\r\nheretofore been kept warm in her remembrance by the chimney-corner glow that\r\nwas associated with them,—now recurred to her, sombre, ghastly, cold,\r\nlike most passages of family history, when brooded over in melancholy mood. The\r\nwhole seemed little else but a series of calamity, reproducing itself in\r\nsuccessive generations, with one general hue, and varying in little, save the\r\noutline. But Hepzibah now felt as if the Judge, and Clifford, and\r\nherself,—they three together,—were on the point of adding another\r\nincident to the annals of the house, with a bolder relief of wrong and sorrow,\r\nwhich would cause it to stand out from all the rest. Thus it is that the grief\r\nof the passing moment takes upon itself an individuality, and a character of\r\nclimax, which it is destined to lose after a while, and to fade into the dark\r\ngray tissue common to the grave or glad events of many years ago. It is but for\r\na moment, comparatively, that anything looks strange or startling,—a\r\ntruth that has the bitter and the sweet in it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Hepzibah could not rid herself of the sense of something unprecedented at\r\nthat instant passing and soon to be accomplished. Her nerves were in a shake.\r\nInstinctively she paused before the arched window, and looked out upon the\r\nstreet, in order to seize its permanent objects with her mental grasp, and thus\r\nto steady herself from the reel and vibration which affected her more immediate\r\nsphere. It brought her up, as we may say, with a kind of shock, when she beheld\r\neverything under the same appearance as the day before, and numberless\r\npreceding days, except for the difference between sunshine and sullen storm.\r\nHer eyes travelled along the street, from doorstep to doorstep, noting the wet\r\nsidewalks, with here and there a puddle in hollows that had been imperceptible\r\nuntil filled with water. She screwed her dim optics to their acutest point, in\r\nthe hope of making out, with greater distinctness, a certain window, where she\r\nhalf saw, half guessed, that a tailor’s seamstress was sitting at her\r\nwork. Hepzibah flung herself upon that unknown woman’s companionship,\r\neven thus far off. Then she was attracted by a chaise rapidly passing, and\r\nwatched its moist and glistening top, and its splashing wheels, until it had\r\nturned the corner, and refused to carry any further her idly trifling, because\r\nappalled and overburdened, mind. When the vehicle had disappeared, she allowed\r\nherself still another loitering moment; for the patched figure of good Uncle\r\nVenner was now visible, coming slowly from the head of the street downward,\r\nwith a rheumatic limp, because the east wind had got into his joints. Hepzibah\r\nwished that he would pass yet more slowly, and befriend her shivering solitude\r\na little longer. Anything that would take her out of the grievous present, and\r\ninterpose human beings betwixt herself and what was nearest to\r\nher,—whatever would defer for an instant the inevitable errand on which\r\nshe was bound,—all such impediments were welcome. Next to the lightest\r\nheart, the heaviest is apt to be most playful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah had little hardihood for her own proper pain, and far less for what\r\nshe must inflict on Clifford. Of so slight a nature, and so shattered by his\r\nprevious calamities, it could not well be short of utter ruin to bring him face\r\nto face with the hard, relentless man who had been his evil destiny through\r\nlife. Even had there been no bitter recollections, nor any hostile interest now\r\nat stake between them, the mere natural repugnance of the more sensitive system\r\nto the massive, weighty, and unimpressible one, must, in itself, have been\r\ndisastrous to the former. It would be like flinging a porcelain vase, with\r\nalready a crack in it, against a granite column. Never before had Hepzibah so\r\nadequately estimated the powerful character of her cousin\r\nJaffrey,—powerful by intellect, energy of will, the long habit of acting\r\namong men, and, as she believed, by his unscrupulous pursuit of selfish ends\r\nthrough evil means. It did but increase the difficulty that Judge Pyncheon was\r\nunder a delusion as to the secret which he supposed Clifford to possess. Men of\r\nhis strength of purpose and customary sagacity, if they chance to adopt a\r\nmistaken opinion in practical matters, so wedge it and fasten it among things\r\nknown to be true, that to wrench it out of their minds is hardly less difficult\r\nthan pulling up an oak. Thus, as the Judge required an impossibility of\r\nClifford, the latter, as he could not perform it, must needs perish. For what,\r\nin the grasp of a man like this, was to become of Clifford’s soft poetic\r\nnature, that never should have had a task more stubborn than to set a life of\r\nbeautiful enjoyment to the flow and rhythm of musical cadences! Indeed, what\r\nhad become of it already? Broken! Blighted! All but annihilated! Soon to be\r\nwholly so!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a moment, the thought crossed Hepzibah’s mind, whether Clifford might\r\nnot really have such knowledge of their deceased uncle’s vanished estate\r\nas the Judge imputed to him. She remembered some vague intimations, on her\r\nbrother’s part, which—if the supposition were not essentially\r\npreposterous—might have been so interpreted. There had been schemes of\r\ntravel and residence abroad, day-dreams of brilliant life at home, and splendid\r\ncastles in the air, which it would have required boundless wealth to build and\r\nrealize. Had this wealth been in her power, how gladly would Hepzibah have\r\nbestowed it all upon her iron-hearted kinsman, to buy for Clifford the freedom\r\nand seclusion of the desolate old house! But she believed that her\r\nbrother’s schemes were as destitute of actual substance and purpose as a\r\nchild’s pictures of its future life, while sitting in a little chair by\r\nits mother’s knee. Clifford had none but shadowy gold at his command; and\r\nit was not the stuff to satisfy Judge Pyncheon!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWas there no help in their extremity? It seemed strange that there should be\r\nnone, with a city round about her. It would be so easy to throw up the window,\r\nand send forth a shriek, at the strange agony of which everybody would come\r\nhastening to the rescue, well understanding it to be the cry of a human soul,\r\nat some dreadful crisis! But how wild, how almost laughable, the\r\nfatality,—and yet how continually it comes to pass, thought Hepzibah, in\r\nthis dull delirium of a world,—that whosoever, and with however kindly a\r\npurpose, should come to help, they would be sure to help the strongest side!\r\nMight and wrong combined, like iron magnetized, are endowed with irresistible\r\nattraction. There would be Judge Pyncheon,—a person eminent in the public\r\nview, of high station and great wealth, a philanthropist, a member of Congress\r\nand of the church, and intimately associated with whatever else bestows good\r\nname,—so imposing, in these advantageous lights, that Hepzibah herself\r\ncould hardly help shrinking from her own conclusions as to his hollow\r\nintegrity. The Judge, on one side! And who, on the other? The guilty Clifford!\r\nOnce a byword! Now, an indistinctly remembered ignominy!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, in spite of this perception that the Judge would draw all human\r\naid to his own behalf, Hepzibah was so unaccustomed to act for herself, that\r\nthe least word of counsel would have swayed her to any mode of action. Little\r\nPhœbe Pyncheon would at once have lighted up the whole scene, if not by any\r\navailable suggestion, yet simply by the warm vivacity of her character. The\r\nidea of the artist occurred to Hepzibah. Young and unknown, mere vagrant\r\nadventurer as he was, she had been conscious of a force in Holgrave which might\r\nwell adapt him to be the champion of a crisis. With this thought in her mind,\r\nshe unbolted a door, cobwebbed and long disused, but which had served as a\r\nformer medium of communication between her own part of the house and the gable\r\nwhere the wandering daguerreotypist had now established his temporary home. He\r\nwas not there. A book, face downward, on the table, a roll of manuscript, a\r\nhalf-written sheet, a newspaper, some tools of his present occupation, and\r\nseveral rejected daguerreotypes, conveyed an impression as if he were close at\r\nhand. But, at this period of the day, as Hepzibah might have anticipated, the\r\nartist was at his public rooms. With an impulse of idle curiosity, that\r\nflickered among her heavy thoughts, she looked at one of the daguerreotypes,\r\nand beheld Judge Pyncheon frowning at her. Fate stared her in the face. She\r\nturned back from her fruitless quest, with a heartsinking sense of\r\ndisappointment. In all her years of seclusion, she had never felt, as now, what\r\nit was to be alone. It seemed as if the house stood in a desert, or, by some\r\nspell, was made invisible to those who dwelt around, or passed beside it; so\r\nthat any mode of misfortune, miserable accident, or crime might happen in it\r\nwithout the possibility of aid. In her grief and wounded pride, Hepzibah had\r\nspent her life in divesting herself of friends; she had wilfully cast off the\r\nsupport which God has ordained his creatures to need from one another; and it\r\nwas now her punishment, that Clifford and herself would fall the easier victims\r\nto their kindred enemy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nReturning to the arched window, she lifted her eyes,—scowling, poor,\r\ndim-sighted Hepzibah, in the face of Heaven!—and strove hard to send up a\r\nprayer through the dense gray pavement of clouds. Those mists had gathered, as\r\nif to symbolize a great, brooding mass of human trouble, doubt, confusion, and\r\nchill indifference, between earth and the better regions. Her faith was too\r\nweak; the prayer too heavy to be thus uplifted. It fell back, a lump of lead,\r\nupon her heart. It smote her with the wretched conviction that Providence\r\nintermeddled not in these petty wrongs of one individual to his fellow, nor had\r\nany balm for these little agonies of a solitary soul; but shed its justice, and\r\nits mercy, in a broad, sunlike sweep, over half the universe at once. Its\r\nvastness made it nothing. But Hepzibah did not see that, just as there comes a\r\nwarm sunbeam into every cottage window, so comes a lovebeam of God’s care\r\nand pity for every separate need.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last, finding no other pretext for deferring the torture that she was to\r\ninflict on Clifford,—her reluctance to which was the true cause of her\r\nloitering at the window, her search for the artist, and even her abortive\r\nprayer,—dreading, also, to hear the stern voice of Judge Pyncheon from\r\nbelow stairs, chiding her delay,—she crept slowly, a pale, grief-stricken\r\nfigure, a dismal shape of woman, with almost torpid limbs, slowly to her\r\nbrother’s door, and knocked!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd how should there have been? Her hand, tremulous with the shrinking purpose\r\nwhich directed it, had smitten so feebly against the door that the sound could\r\nhardly have gone inward. She knocked again. Still no response! Nor was it to be\r\nwondered at. She had struck with the entire force of her heart’s\r\nvibration, communicating, by some subtile magnetism, her own terror to the\r\nsummons. Clifford would turn his face to the pillow, and cover his head beneath\r\nthe bedclothes, like a startled child at midnight. She knocked a third time,\r\nthree regular strokes, gentle, but perfectly distinct, and with meaning in\r\nthem; for, modulate it with what cautious art we will, the hand cannot help\r\nplaying some tune of what we feel upon the senseless wood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford returned no answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford! Dear brother!” said Hepzibah. “Shall I come\r\nin?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA silence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTwo or three times, and more, Hepzibah repeated his name, without result; till,\r\nthinking her brother’s sleep unwontedly profound, she undid the door, and\r\nentering, found the chamber vacant. How could he have come forth, and when,\r\nwithout her knowledge? Was it possible that, in spite of the stormy day, and\r\nworn out with the irksomeness within doors he had betaken himself to his\r\ncustomary haunt in the garden, and was now shivering under the cheerless\r\nshelter of the summer-house? She hastily threw up a window, thrust forth her\r\nturbaned head and the half of her gaunt figure, and searched the whole garden\r\nthrough, as completely as her dim vision would allow. She could see the\r\ninterior of the summer-house, and its circular seat, kept moist by the\r\ndroppings of the roof. It had no occupant. Clifford was not thereabouts;\r\nunless, indeed, he had crept for concealment (as, for a moment, Hepzibah\r\nfancied might be the case) into a great, wet mass of tangled and broad-leaved\r\nshadow, where the squash-vines were clambering tumultuously upon an old wooden\r\nframework, set casually aslant against the fence. This could not be, however;\r\nhe was not there; for, while Hepzibah was looking, a strange grimalkin stole\r\nforth from the very spot, and picked his way across the garden. Twice he paused\r\nto snuff the air, and then anew directed his course towards the parlor window.\r\nWhether it was only on account of the stealthy, prying manner common to the\r\nrace, or that this cat seemed to have more than ordinary mischief in his\r\nthoughts, the old gentlewoman, in spite of her much perplexity, felt an impulse\r\nto drive the animal away, and accordingly flung down a window stick. The cat\r\nstared up at her, like a detected thief or murderer, and, the next instant,\r\ntook to flight. No other living creature was visible in the garden. Chanticleer\r\nand his family had either not left their roost, disheartened by the\r\ninterminable rain, or had done the next wisest thing, by seasonably returning\r\nto it. Hepzibah closed the window.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut where was Clifford? Could it be that, aware of the presence of his Evil\r\nDestiny, he had crept silently down the staircase, while the Judge and Hepzibah\r\nstood talking in the shop, and had softly undone the fastenings of the outer\r\ndoor, and made his escape into the street? With that thought, she seemed to\r\nbehold his gray, wrinkled, yet childlike aspect, in the old-fashioned garments\r\nwhich he wore about the house; a figure such as one sometimes imagines himself\r\nto be, with the world’s eye upon him, in a troubled dream. This figure of\r\nher wretched brother would go wandering through the city, attracting all eyes,\r\nand everybody’s wonder and repugnance, like a ghost, the more to be\r\nshuddered at because visible at noontide. To incur the ridicule of the younger\r\ncrowd, that knew him not,—the harsher scorn and indignation of a few old\r\nmen, who might recall his once familiar features! To be the sport of boys, who,\r\nwhen old enough to run about the streets, have no more reverence for what is\r\nbeautiful and holy, nor pity for what is sad,—no more sense of sacred\r\nmisery, sanctifying the human shape in which it embodies itself,—than if\r\nSatan were the father of them all! Goaded by their taunts, their loud, shrill\r\ncries, and cruel laughter,—insulted by the filth of the public ways,\r\nwhich they would fling upon him,—or, as it might well be, distracted by\r\nthe mere strangeness of his situation, though nobody should afflict him with so\r\nmuch as a thoughtless word,—what wonder if Clifford were to break into\r\nsome wild extravagance which was certain to be interpreted as lunacy? Thus\r\nJudge Pyncheon’s fiendish scheme would be ready accomplished to his\r\nhands!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen Hepzibah reflected that the town was almost completely water-girdled. The\r\nwharves stretched out towards the centre of the harbor, and, in this inclement\r\nweather, were deserted by the ordinary throng of merchants, laborers, and\r\nsea-faring men; each wharf a solitude, with the vessels moored stem and stern,\r\nalong its misty length. Should her brother’s aimless footsteps stray\r\nthitherward, and he but bend, one moment, over the deep, black tide, would he\r\nnot bethink himself that here was the sure refuge within his reach, and that,\r\nwith a single step, or the slightest overbalance of his body, he might be\r\nforever beyond his kinsman’s gripe? Oh, the temptation! To make of his\r\nponderous sorrow a security! To sink, with its leaden weight upon him, and\r\nnever rise again!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe horror of this last conception was too much for Hepzibah. Even Jaffrey\r\nPyncheon must help her now! She hastened down the staircase, shrieking as she\r\nwent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford is gone!” she cried. “I cannot find my brother.\r\nHelp, Jaffrey Pyncheon! Some harm will happen to him!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe threw open the parlor-door. But, what with the shade of branches across the\r\nwindows, and the smoke-blackened ceiling, and the dark oak-panelling of the\r\nwalls, there was hardly so much daylight in the room that Hepzibah’s\r\nimperfect sight could accurately distinguish the Judge’s figure. She was\r\ncertain, however, that she saw him sitting in the ancestral arm-chair, near the\r\ncentre of the floor, with his face somewhat averted, and looking towards a\r\nwindow. So firm and quiet is the nervous system of such men as Judge Pyncheon,\r\nthat he had perhaps stirred not more than once since her departure, but, in the\r\nhard composure of his temperament, retained the position into which accident\r\nhad thrown him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I tell you, Jaffrey,” cried Hepzibah impatiently, as she turned\r\nfrom the parlor-door to search other rooms, “my brother is not in his\r\nchamber! You must help me seek him!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Judge Pyncheon was not the man to let himself be startled from an\r\neasy-chair with haste ill-befitting either the dignity of his character or his\r\nbroad personal basis, by the alarm of an hysteric woman. Yet, considering his\r\nown interest in the matter, he might have bestirred himself with a little more\r\nalacrity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you hear me, Jaffrey Pyncheon?” screamed Hepzibah, as she again\r\napproached the parlor-door, after an ineffectual search elsewhere.\r\n“Clifford is gone.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt this instant, on the threshold of the parlor, emerging from within, appeared\r\nClifford himself! His face was preternaturally pale; so deadly white, indeed,\r\nthat, through all the glimmering indistinctness of the passageway, Hepzibah\r\ncould discern his features, as if a light fell on them alone. Their vivid and\r\nwild expression seemed likewise sufficient to illuminate them; it was an\r\nexpression of scorn and mockery, coinciding with the emotions indicated by his\r\ngesture. As Clifford stood on the threshold, partly turning back, he pointed\r\nhis finger within the parlor, and shook it slowly as though he would have\r\nsummoned, not Hepzibah alone, but the whole world, to gaze at some object\r\ninconceivably ridiculous. This action, so ill-timed and\r\nextravagant,—accompanied, too, with a look that showed more like joy than\r\nany other kind of excitement,—compelled Hepzibah to dread that her stern\r\nkinsman’s ominous visit had driven her poor brother to absolute insanity.\r\nNor could she otherwise account for the Judge’s quiescent mood than by\r\nsupposing him craftily on the watch, while Clifford developed these symptoms of\r\na distracted mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Be quiet, Clifford!” whispered his sister, raising her hand to\r\nimpress caution. “Oh, for Heaven’s sake, be quiet!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let him be quiet! What can he do better?” answered Clifford, with\r\na still wilder gesture, pointing into the room which he had just quitted.\r\n“As for us, Hepzibah, we can dance now!—we can sing, laugh, play,\r\ndo what we will! The weight is gone, Hepzibah! It is gone off this weary old\r\nworld, and we may be as light-hearted as little Phœbe herself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd, in accordance with his words, he began to laugh, still pointing his finger\r\nat the object, invisible to Hepzibah, within the parlor. She was seized with a\r\nsudden intuition of some horrible thing. She thrust herself past Clifford, and\r\ndisappeared into the room; but almost immediately returned, with a cry choking\r\nin her throat. Gazing at her brother with an affrighted glance of inquiry, she\r\nbeheld him all in a tremor and a quake, from head to foot, while, amid these\r\ncommoted elements of passion or alarm, still flickered his gusty mirth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My God! what is to become of us?” gasped Hepzibah.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come!” said Clifford in a tone of brief decision, most unlike what\r\nwas usual with him. “We stay here too long! Let us leave the old house to\r\nour cousin Jaffrey! He will take good care of it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah now noticed that Clifford had on a cloak,—a garment of long\r\nago,—in which he had constantly muffled himself during these days of\r\neasterly storm. He beckoned with his hand, and intimated, so far as she could\r\ncomprehend him, his purpose that they should go together from the house. There\r\nare chaotic, blind, or drunken moments, in the lives of persons who lack real\r\nforce of character,—moments of test, in which courage would most assert\r\nitself,—but where these individuals, if left to themselves, stagger\r\naimlessly along, or follow implicitly whatever guidance may befall them, even\r\nif it be a child’s. No matter how preposterous or insane, a purpose is a\r\nGodsend to them. Hepzibah had reached this point. Unaccustomed to action or\r\nresponsibility,—full of horror at what she had seen, and afraid to\r\ninquire, or almost to imagine, how it had come to pass,—affrighted at the\r\nfatality which seemed to pursue her brother,—stupefied by the dim, thick,\r\nstifling atmosphere of dread which filled the house as with a death-smell, and\r\nobliterated all definiteness of thought,—she yielded without a question,\r\nand on the instant, to the will which Clifford expressed. For herself, she was\r\nlike a person in a dream, when the will always sleeps. Clifford, ordinarily so\r\ndestitute of this faculty, had found it in the tension of the crisis.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why do you delay so?” cried he sharply. “Put on your cloak\r\nand hood, or whatever it pleases you to wear! No matter what; you cannot look\r\nbeautiful nor brilliant, my poor Hepzibah! Take your purse, with money in it,\r\nand come along!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHepzibah obeyed these instructions, as if nothing else were to be done or\r\nthought of. She began to wonder, it is true, why she did not wake up, and at\r\nwhat still more intolerable pitch of dizzy trouble her spirit would struggle\r\nout of the maze, and make her conscious that nothing of all this had actually\r\nhappened. Of course it was not real; no such black, easterly day as this had\r\nyet begun to be; Judge Pyncheon had not talked with, her. Clifford had not\r\nlaughed, pointed, beckoned her away with him; but she had merely been\r\nafflicted—as lonely sleepers often are—with a great deal of\r\nunreasonable misery, in a morning dream!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now—now—I shall certainly awake!” thought Hepzibah, as\r\nshe went to and fro, making her little preparations. “I can bear it no\r\nlonger I must wake up now!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it came not, that awakening moment! It came not, even when, just before\r\nthey left the house, Clifford stole to the parlor-door, and made a parting\r\nobeisance to the sole occupant of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What an absurd figure the old fellow cuts now!” whispered he to\r\nHepzibah. “Just when he fancied he had me completely under his thumb!\r\nCome, come; make haste! or he will start up, like Giant Despair in pursuit of\r\nChristian and Hopeful, and catch us yet!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs they passed into the street, Clifford directed Hepzibah’s attention to\r\nsomething on one of the posts of the front door. It was merely the initials of\r\nhis own name, which, with somewhat of his characteristic grace about the forms\r\nof the letters, he had cut there when a boy. The brother and sister departed,\r\nand left Judge Pyncheon sitting in the old home of his forefathers, all by\r\nhimself; so heavy and lumpish that we can liken him to nothing better than a\r\ndefunct nightmare, which had perished in the midst of its wickedness, and left\r\nits flabby corpse on the breast of the tormented one, to be gotten rid of as it\r\nmight!\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap17\"></a>XVII.<br>\r\nThe Flight of Two Owls</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nSummer as it was, the east wind set poor Hepzibah’s few remaining teeth\r\nchattering in her head, as she and Clifford faced it, on their way up Pyncheon\r\nStreet, and towards the centre of the town. Not merely was it the shiver which\r\nthis pitiless blast brought to her frame (although her feet and hands,\r\nespecially, had never seemed so death-a-cold as now), but there was a moral\r\nsensation, mingling itself with the physical chill, and causing her to shake\r\nmore in spirit than in body. The world’s broad, bleak atmosphere was all\r\nso comfortless! Such, indeed, is the impression which it makes on every new\r\nadventurer, even if he plunge into it while the warmest tide of life is\r\nbubbling through his veins. What, then, must it have been to Hepzibah and\r\nClifford,—so time-stricken as they were, yet so like children in their\r\ninexperience,—as they left the doorstep, and passed from beneath the wide\r\nshelter of the Pyncheon Elm! They were wandering all abroad, on precisely such\r\na pilgrimage as a child often meditates, to the world’s end, with perhaps\r\na sixpence and a biscuit in his pocket. In Hepzibah’s mind, there was the\r\nwretched consciousness of being adrift. She had lost the faculty of\r\nself-guidance; but, in view of the difficulties around her, felt it hardly\r\nworth an effort to regain it, and was, moreover, incapable of making one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs they proceeded on their strange expedition, she now and then cast a look\r\nsidelong at Clifford, and could not but observe that he was possessed and\r\nswayed by a powerful excitement. It was this, indeed, that gave him the control\r\nwhich he had at once, and so irresistibly, established over his movements. It\r\nnot a little resembled the exhilaration of wine. Or, it might more fancifully\r\nbe compared to a joyous piece of music, played with wild vivacity, but upon a\r\ndisordered instrument. As the cracked jarring note might always be heard, and\r\nas it jarred loudest amidst the loftiest exultation of the melody, so was there\r\na continual quake through Clifford, causing him most to quiver while he wore a\r\ntriumphant smile, and seemed almost under a necessity to skip in his gait.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey met few people abroad, even on passing from the retired neighborhood of\r\nthe House of the Seven Gables into what was ordinarily the more thronged and\r\nbusier portion of the town. Glistening sidewalks, with little pools of rain,\r\nhere and there, along their unequal surface; umbrellas displayed ostentatiously\r\nin the shop-windows, as if the life of trade had concentrated itself in that\r\none article; wet leaves of the horse-chestnut or elm-trees, torn off untimely\r\nby the blast and scattered along the public way; an unsightly accumulation of\r\nmud in the middle of the street, which perversely grew the more unclean for its\r\nlong and laborious washing,—these were the more definable points of a\r\nvery sombre picture. In the way of movement and human life, there was the hasty\r\nrattle of a cab or coach, its driver protected by a waterproof cap over his\r\nhead and shoulders; the forlorn figure of an old man, who seemed to have crept\r\nout of some subterranean sewer, and was stooping along the kennel, and poking\r\nthe wet rubbish with a stick, in quest of rusty nails; a merchant or two, at\r\nthe door of the post-office, together with an editor and a miscellaneous\r\npolitician, awaiting a dilatory mail; a few visages of retired sea-captains at\r\nthe window of an insurance office, looking out vacantly at the vacant street,\r\nblaspheming at the weather, and fretting at the dearth as well of public news\r\nas local gossip. What a treasure-trove to these venerable quidnuncs, could they\r\nhave guessed the secret which Hepzibah and Clifford were carrying along with\r\nthem! But their two figures attracted hardly so much notice as that of a young\r\ngirl, who passed at the same instant, and happened to raise her skirt a trifle\r\ntoo high above her ankles. Had it been a sunny and cheerful day, they could\r\nhardly have gone through the streets without making themselves obnoxious to\r\nremark. Now, probably, they were felt to be in keeping with the dismal and\r\nbitter weather, and therefore did not stand out in strong relief, as if the sun\r\nwere shining on them, but melted into the gray gloom and were forgotten as soon\r\nas gone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Hepzibah! Could she have understood this fact, it would have brought her\r\nsome little comfort; for, to all her other troubles,—strange to\r\nsay!—there was added the womanish and old-maiden-like misery arising from\r\na sense of unseemliness in her attire. Thus, she was fain to shrink deeper into\r\nherself, as it were, as if in the hope of making people suppose that here was\r\nonly a cloak and hood, threadbare and woefully faded, taking an airing in the\r\nmidst of the storm, without any wearer!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs they went on, the feeling of indistinctness and unreality kept dimly\r\nhovering round about her, and so diffusing itself into her system that one of\r\nher hands was hardly palpable to the touch of the other. Any certainty would\r\nhave been preferable to this. She whispered to herself, again and again,\r\n“Am I awake?—Am I awake?” and sometimes exposed her face to\r\nthe chill spatter of the wind, for the sake of its rude assurance that she was.\r\nWhether it was Clifford’s purpose, or only chance, had led them thither,\r\nthey now found themselves passing beneath the arched entrance of a large\r\nstructure of gray stone. Within, there was a spacious breadth, and an airy\r\nheight from floor to roof, now partially filled with smoke and steam, which\r\neddied voluminously upward and formed a mimic cloud-region over their heads. A\r\ntrain of cars was just ready for a start; the locomotive was fretting and\r\nfuming, like a steed impatient for a headlong rush; and the bell rang out its\r\nhasty peal, so well expressing the brief summons which life vouchsafes to us in\r\nits hurried career. Without question or delay,—with the irresistible\r\ndecision, if not rather to be called recklessness, which had so strangely taken\r\npossession of him, and through him of Hepzibah,—Clifford impelled her\r\ntowards the cars, and assisted her to enter. The signal was given; the engine\r\npuffed forth its short, quick breaths; the train began its movement; and, along\r\nwith a hundred other passengers, these two unwonted travellers sped onward like\r\nthe wind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last, therefore, and after so long estrangement from everything that the\r\nworld acted or enjoyed, they had been drawn into the great current of human\r\nlife, and were swept away with it, as by the suction of fate itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStill haunted with the idea that not one of the past incidents, inclusive of\r\nJudge Pyncheon’s visit, could be real, the recluse of the Seven Gables\r\nmurmured in her brother’s ear,—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Clifford! Clifford! Is not this a dream?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A dream, Hepzibah!” repeated he, almost laughing in her face.\r\n“On the contrary, I have never been awake before!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile, looking from the window, they could see the world racing past them.\r\nAt one moment, they were rattling through a solitude; the next, a village had\r\ngrown up around them; a few breaths more, and it had vanished, as if swallowed\r\nby an earthquake. The spires of meeting-houses seemed set adrift from their\r\nfoundations; the broad-based hills glided away. Everything was unfixed from its\r\nage-long rest, and moving at whirlwind speed in a direction opposite to their\r\nown.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWithin the car there was the usual interior life of the railroad, offering\r\nlittle to the observation of other passengers, but full of novelty for this\r\npair of strangely enfranchised prisoners. It was novelty enough, indeed, that\r\nthere were fifty human beings in close relation with them, under one long and\r\nnarrow roof, and drawn onward by the same mighty influence that had taken their\r\ntwo selves into its grasp. It seemed marvellous how all these people could\r\nremain so quietly in their seats, while so much noisy strength was at work in\r\ntheir behalf. Some, with tickets in their hats (long travellers these, before\r\nwhom lay a hundred miles of railroad), had plunged into the English scenery and\r\nadventures of pamphlet novels, and were keeping company with dukes and earls.\r\nOthers, whose briefer span forbade their devoting themselves to studies so\r\nabstruse, beguiled the little tedium of the way with penny-papers. A party of\r\ngirls, and one young man, on opposite sides of the car, found huge amusement in\r\na game of ball. They tossed it to and fro, with peals of laughter that might be\r\nmeasured by mile-lengths; for, faster than the nimble ball could fly, the merry\r\nplayers fled unconsciously along, leaving the trail of their mirth afar behind,\r\nand ending their game under another sky than had witnessed its commencement.\r\nBoys, with apples, cakes, candy, and rolls of variously tinctured\r\nlozenges,—merchandise that reminded Hepzibah of her deserted\r\nshop,—appeared at each momentary stopping-place, doing up their business\r\nin a hurry, or breaking it short off, lest the market should ravish them away\r\nwith it. New people continually entered. Old acquaintances—for such they\r\nsoon grew to be, in this rapid current of affairs—continually departed.\r\nHere and there, amid the rumble and the tumult, sat one asleep. Sleep; sport;\r\nbusiness; graver or lighter study; and the common and inevitable movement\r\nonward! It was life itself!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford’s naturally poignant sympathies were all aroused. He caught the\r\ncolor of what was passing about him, and threw it back more vividly than he\r\nreceived it, but mixed, nevertheless, with a lurid and portentous hue.\r\nHepzibah, on the other hand, felt herself more apart from human kind than even\r\nin the seclusion which she had just quitted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are not happy, Hepzibah!” said Clifford, apart, in a tone of\r\nreproach. “You are thinking of that dismal old house, and of Cousin\r\nJaffrey”—here came the quake through him,—“and of\r\nCousin Jaffrey sitting there, all by himself! Take my advice,—follow my\r\nexample,—and let such things slip aside. Here we are, in the world,\r\nHepzibah!—in the midst of life!—in the throng of our fellow beings!\r\nLet you and I be happy! As happy as that youth and those pretty girls, at their\r\ngame of ball!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Happy—” thought Hepzibah, bitterly conscious, at the word,\r\nof her dull and heavy heart, with the frozen pain in it,—“happy. He\r\nis mad already; and, if I could once feel myself broad awake, I should go mad\r\ntoo!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf a fixed idea be madness, she was perhaps not remote from it. Fast and far as\r\nthey had rattled and clattered along the iron track, they might just as well,\r\nas regarded Hepzibah’s mental images, have been passing up and down\r\nPyncheon Street. With miles and miles of varied scenery between, there was no\r\nscene for her save the seven old gable-peaks, with their moss, and the tuft of\r\nweeds in one of the angles, and the shop-window, and a customer shaking the\r\ndoor, and compelling the little bell to jingle fiercely, but without disturbing\r\nJudge Pyncheon! This one old house was everywhere! It transported its great,\r\nlumbering bulk with more than railroad speed, and set itself phlegmatically\r\ndown on whatever spot she glanced at. The quality of Hepzibah’s mind was\r\ntoo unmalleable to take new impressions so readily as Clifford’s. He had\r\na winged nature; she was rather of the vegetable kind, and could hardly be kept\r\nlong alive, if drawn up by the roots. Thus it happened that the relation\r\nheretofore existing between her brother and herself was changed. At home, she\r\nwas his guardian; here, Clifford had become hers, and seemed to comprehend\r\nwhatever belonged to their new position with a singular rapidity of\r\nintelligence. He had been startled into manhood and intellectual vigor; or, at\r\nleast, into a condition that resembled them, though it might be both diseased\r\nand transitory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe conductor now applied for their tickets; and Clifford, who had made himself\r\nthe purse-bearer, put a bank-note into his hand, as he had observed others do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For the lady and yourself?” asked the conductor. “And how\r\nfar?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As far as that will carry us,” said Clifford. “It is no\r\ngreat matter. We are riding for pleasure merely.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You choose a strange day for it, sir!” remarked a gimlet-eyed old\r\ngentleman on the other side of the car, looking at Clifford and his companion,\r\nas if curious to make them out. “The best chance of pleasure, in an\r\neasterly rain, I take it, is in a man’s own house, with a nice little\r\nfire in the chimney.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I cannot precisely agree with you,” said Clifford, courteously\r\nbowing to the old gentleman, and at once taking up the clew of conversation\r\nwhich the latter had proffered. “It had just occurred to me, on the\r\ncontrary, that this admirable invention of the railroad—with the vast and\r\ninevitable improvements to be looked for, both as to speed and\r\nconvenience—is destined to do away with those stale ideas of home and\r\nfireside, and substitute something better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In the name of common-sense,” asked the old gentleman rather\r\ntestily, “what can be better for a man than his own parlor and\r\nchimney-corner?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These things have not the merit which many good people attribute to\r\nthem,” replied Clifford. “They may be said, in few and pithy words,\r\nto have ill served a poor purpose. My impression is, that our wonderfully\r\nincreased and still increasing facilities of locomotion are destined to bring\r\nus around again to the nomadic state. You are aware, my dear sir,—you\r\nmust have observed it in your own experience,—that all human progress is\r\nin a circle; or, to use a more accurate and beautiful figure, in an ascending\r\nspiral curve. While we fancy ourselves going straight forward, and attaining,\r\nat every step, an entirely new position of affairs, we do actually return to\r\nsomething long ago tried and abandoned, but which we now find etherealized,\r\nrefined, and perfected to its ideal. The past is but a coarse and sensual\r\nprophecy of the present and the future. To apply this truth to the topic now\r\nunder discussion. In the early epochs of our race, men dwelt in temporary huts,\r\nof bowers of branches, as easily constructed as a bird’s-nest, and which\r\nthey built,—if it should be called building, when such sweet homes of a\r\nsummer solstice rather grew than were made with hands,—which Nature, we\r\nwill say, assisted them to rear where fruit abounded, where fish and game were\r\nplentiful, or, most especially, where the sense of beauty was to be gratified\r\nby a lovelier shade than elsewhere, and a more exquisite arrangement of lake,\r\nwood, and hill. This life possessed a charm which, ever since man quitted it,\r\nhas vanished from existence. And it typified something better than itself. It\r\nhad its drawbacks; such as hunger and thirst, inclement weather, hot sunshine,\r\nand weary and foot-blistering marches over barren and ugly tracts, that lay\r\nbetween the sites desirable for their fertility and beauty. But in our\r\nascending spiral, we escape all this. These railroads—could but the\r\nwhistle be made musical, and the rumble and the jar got rid of—are\r\npositively the greatest blessing that the ages have wrought out for us. They\r\ngive us wings; they annihilate the toil and dust of pilgrimage; they\r\nspiritualize travel! Transition being so facile, what can be any man’s\r\ninducement to tarry in one spot? Why, therefore, should he build a more\r\ncumbrous habitation than can readily be carried off with him? Why should he\r\nmake himself a prisoner for life in brick, and stone, and old worm-eaten\r\ntimber, when he may just as easily dwell, in one sense, nowhere,—in a\r\nbetter sense, wherever the fit and beautiful shall offer him a home?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford’s countenance glowed, as he divulged this theory; a youthful\r\ncharacter shone out from within, converting the wrinkles and pallid duskiness\r\nof age into an almost transparent mask. The merry girls let their ball drop\r\nupon the floor, and gazed at him. They said to themselves, perhaps, that,\r\nbefore his hair was gray and the crow’s-feet tracked his temples, this\r\nnow decaying man must have stamped the impress of his features on many a\r\nwoman’s heart. But, alas! no woman’s eye had seen his face while it\r\nwas beautiful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should scarcely call it an improved state of things,” observed\r\nClifford’s new acquaintance, “to live everywhere and\r\nnowhere!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Would you not?” exclaimed Clifford, with singular energy.\r\n“It is as clear to me as sunshine,—were there any in the\r\nsky,—that the greatest possible stumbling-blocks in the path of human\r\nhappiness and improvement are these heaps of bricks and stones, consolidated\r\nwith mortar, or hewn timber, fastened together with spike-nails, which men\r\npainfully contrive for their own torment, and call them house and home! The\r\nsoul needs air; a wide sweep and frequent change of it. Morbid influences, in a\r\nthousand-fold variety, gather about hearths, and pollute the life of\r\nhouseholds. There is no such unwholesome atmosphere as that of an old home,\r\nrendered poisonous by one’s defunct forefathers and relatives. I speak of\r\nwhat I know. There is a certain house within my familiar\r\nrecollection,—one of those peaked-gable (there are seven of them),\r\nprojecting-storied edifices, such as you occasionally see in our older\r\ntowns,—a rusty, crazy, creaky, dry-rotted, dingy, dark, and miserable old\r\ndungeon, with an arched window over the porch, and a little shop-door on one\r\nside, and a great, melancholy elm before it! Now, sir, whenever my thoughts\r\nrecur to this seven-gabled mansion (the fact is so very curious that I must\r\nneeds mention it), immediately I have a vision or image of an elderly man, of\r\nremarkably stern countenance, sitting in an oaken elbow-chair, dead,\r\nstone-dead, with an ugly flow of blood upon his shirt-bosom! Dead, but with\r\nopen eyes! He taints the whole house, as I remember it. I could never flourish\r\nthere, nor be happy, nor do nor enjoy what God meant me to do and enjoy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis face darkened, and seemed to contract, and shrivel itself up, and wither\r\ninto age.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never, sir!” he repeated. “I could never draw cheerful\r\nbreath there!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should think not,” said the old gentleman, eyeing Clifford\r\nearnestly, and rather apprehensively. “I should conceive not, sir, with\r\nthat notion in your head!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Surely not,” continued Clifford; “and it were a relief to me\r\nif that house could be torn down, or burnt up, and so the earth be rid of it,\r\nand grass be sown abundantly over its foundation. Not that I should ever visit\r\nits site again! for, sir, the farther I get away from it, the more does the\r\njoy, the lightsome freshness, the heart-leap, the intellectual dance, the\r\nyouth, in short,—yes, my youth, my youth!—the more does it come\r\nback to me. No longer ago than this morning, I was old. I remember looking in\r\nthe glass, and wondering at my own gray hair, and the wrinkles, many and deep,\r\nright across my brow, and the furrows down my cheeks, and the prodigious\r\ntrampling of crow’s-feet about my temples! It was too soon! I could not\r\nbear it! Age had no right to come! I had not lived! But now do I look old? If\r\nso, my aspect belies me strangely; for—a great weight being off my\r\nmind—I feel in the very heyday of my youth, with the world and my best\r\ndays before me!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I trust you may find it so,” said the old gentleman, who seemed\r\nrather embarrassed, and desirous of avoiding the observation which\r\nClifford’s wild talk drew on them both. “You have my best wishes\r\nfor it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, dear Clifford, be quiet!” whispered his\r\nsister. “They think you mad.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Be quiet yourself, Hepzibah!” returned her brother. “No\r\nmatter what they think! I am not mad. For the first time in thirty years my\r\nthoughts gush up and find words ready for them. I must talk, and I will!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned again towards the old gentleman, and renewed the conversation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, my dear sir,” said he, “it is my firm belief and hope\r\nthat these terms of roof and hearth-stone, which have so long been held to\r\nembody something sacred, are soon to pass out of men’s daily use, and be\r\nforgotten. Just imagine, for a moment, how much of human evil will crumble\r\naway, with this one change! What we call real estate—the solid ground to\r\nbuild a house on—is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of\r\nthis world rests. A man will commit almost any wrong,—he will heap up an\r\nimmense pile of wickedness, as hard as granite, and which will weigh as heavily\r\nupon his soul, to eternal ages,—only to build a great, gloomy,\r\ndark-chambered mansion, for himself to die in, and for his posterity to be\r\nmiserable in. He lays his own dead corpse beneath the underpinning, as one may\r\nsay, and hangs his frowning picture on the wall, and, after thus converting\r\nhimself into an evil destiny, expects his remotest great-grandchildren to be\r\nhappy there. I do not speak wildly. I have just such a house in my mind’s\r\neye!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then, sir,” said the old gentleman, getting anxious to drop the\r\nsubject, “you are not to blame for leaving it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Within the lifetime of the child already born,” Clifford went on,\r\n“all this will be done away. The world is growing too ethereal and\r\nspiritual to bear these enormities a great while longer. To me, though, for a\r\nconsiderable period of time, I have lived chiefly in retirement, and know less\r\nof such things than most men,—even to me, the harbingers of a better era\r\nare unmistakable. Mesmerism, now! Will that effect nothing, think you, towards\r\npurging away the grossness out of human life?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All a humbug!” growled the old gentleman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These rapping spirits, that little Phœbe told us of, the other\r\nday,” said Clifford,—“what are these but the messengers of\r\nthe spiritual world, knocking at the door of substance? And it shall be flung\r\nwide open!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A humbug, again!” cried the old gentleman, growing more and more\r\ntesty at these glimpses of Clifford’s metaphysics. “I should like\r\nto rap with a good stick on the empty pates of the dolts who circulate such\r\nnonsense!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then there is electricity,—the demon, the angel, the mighty\r\nphysical power, the all-pervading intelligence!” exclaimed Clifford.\r\n“Is that a humbug, too? Is it a fact—or have I dreamt\r\nit—that, by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great\r\nnerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time? Rather, the\r\nround globe is a vast head, a brain, instinct with intelligence! Or, shall we\r\nsay, it is itself a thought, nothing but thought, and no longer the substance\r\nwhich we deemed it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you mean the telegraph,” said the old gentleman, glancing his\r\neye toward its wire, alongside the rail-track, “it is an excellent\r\nthing,—that is, of course, if the speculators in cotton and politics\r\ndon’t get possession of it. A great thing, indeed, sir, particularly as\r\nregards the detection of bank-robbers and murderers.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t quite like it, in that point of view,” replied\r\nClifford. “A bank-robber, and what you call a murderer, likewise, has his\r\nrights, which men of enlightened humanity and conscience should regard in so\r\nmuch the more liberal spirit, because the bulk of society is prone to\r\ncontrovert their existence. An almost spiritual medium, like the electric\r\ntelegraph, should be consecrated to high, deep, joyful, and holy missions.\r\nLovers, day by day—hour by hour, if so often moved to do it,—might\r\nsend their heart-throbs from Maine to Florida, with some such words as these\r\n‘I love you forever!’—‘My heart runs over with\r\nlove!’—‘I love you more than I can!’ and, again, at the\r\nnext message ‘I have lived an hour longer, and love you twice as\r\nmuch!’ Or, when a good man has departed, his distant friend should be\r\nconscious of an electric thrill, as from the world of happy spirits, telling\r\nhim ‘Your dear friend is in bliss!’ Or, to an absent husband,\r\nshould come tidings thus ‘An immortal being, of whom you are the father,\r\nhas this moment come from God!’ and immediately its little voice would\r\nseem to have reached so far, and to be echoing in his heart. But for these poor\r\nrogues, the bank-robbers,—who, after all, are about as honest as nine\r\npeople in ten, except that they disregard certain formalities, and prefer to\r\ntransact business at midnight rather than ’Change-hours,—and for\r\nthese murderers, as you phrase it, who are often excusable in the motives of\r\ntheir deed, and deserve to be ranked among public benefactors, if we consider\r\nonly its result,—for unfortunate individuals like these, I really cannot\r\napplaud the enlistment of an immaterial and miraculous power in the universal\r\nworld-hunt at their heels!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You can’t, hey?” cried the old gentleman, with a hard look.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Positively, no!” answered Clifford. “It puts them too\r\nmiserably at disadvantage. For example, sir, in a dark, low, cross-beamed,\r\npanelled room of an old house, let us suppose a dead man, sitting in an\r\narm-chair, with a blood-stain on his shirt-bosom,—and let us add to our\r\nhypothesis another man, issuing from the house, which he feels to be\r\nover-filled with the dead man’s presence,—and let us lastly imagine\r\nhim fleeing, Heaven knows whither, at the speed of a hurricane, by railroad!\r\nNow, sir, if the fugitive alight in some distant town, and find all the people\r\nbabbling about that self-same dead man, whom he has fled so far to avoid the\r\nsight and thought of, will you not allow that his natural rights have been\r\ninfringed? He has been deprived of his city of refuge, and, in my humble\r\nopinion, has suffered infinite wrong!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are a strange man; Sir!” said the old gentleman, bringing his\r\ngimlet-eye to a point on Clifford, as if determined to bore right into him.\r\n“I can’t see through you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, I’ll be bound you can’t!” cried Clifford,\r\nlaughing. “And yet, my dear sir, I am as transparent as the water of\r\nMaule’s well! But come, Hepzibah! We have flown far enough for once. Let\r\nus alight, as the birds do, and perch ourselves on the nearest twig, and\r\nconsult wither we shall fly next!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJust then, as it happened, the train reached a solitary way-station. Taking\r\nadvantage of the brief pause, Clifford left the car, and drew Hepzibah along\r\nwith him. A moment afterwards, the train—with all the life of its\r\ninterior, amid which Clifford had made himself so conspicuous an\r\nobject—was gliding away in the distance, and rapidly lessening to a point\r\nwhich, in another moment, vanished. The world had fled away from these two\r\nwanderers. They gazed drearily about them. At a little distance stood a wooden\r\nchurch, black with age, and in a dismal state of ruin and decay, with broken\r\nwindows, a great rift through the main body of the edifice, and a rafter\r\ndangling from the top of the square tower. Farther off was a farm-house, in the\r\nold style, as venerably black as the church, with a roof sloping downward from\r\nthe three-story peak, to within a man’s height of the ground. It seemed\r\nuninhabited. There were the relics of a wood-pile, indeed, near the door, but\r\nwith grass sprouting up among the chips and scattered logs. The small\r\nrain-drops came down aslant; the wind was not turbulent, but sullen, and full\r\nof chilly moisture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClifford shivered from head to foot. The wild effervescence of his\r\nmood—which had so readily supplied thoughts, fantasies, and a strange\r\naptitude of words, and impelled him to talk from the mere necessity of giving\r\nvent to this bubbling-up gush of ideas had entirely subsided. A powerful\r\nexcitement had given him energy and vivacity. Its operation over, he forthwith\r\nbegan to sink.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You must take the lead now, Hepzibah!” murmured he, with a torpid\r\nand reluctant utterance. “Do with me as you will!” She knelt down\r\nupon the platform where they were standing and lifted her clasped hands to the\r\nsky. The dull, gray weight of clouds made it invisible; but it was no hour for\r\ndisbelief,—no juncture this to question that there was a sky above, and\r\nan Almighty Father looking from it!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“O God!”—ejaculated poor, gaunt Hepzibah,—then paused a\r\nmoment, to consider what her prayer should be,—“O God,—our\r\nFather,—are we not thy children? Have mercy on us!”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap18\"></a>XVIII.<br>\r\nGovernor Pyncheon</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nJudge Pyncheon, while his two relatives have fled away with such ill-considered\r\nhaste, still sits in the old parlor, keeping house, as the familiar phrase is,\r\nin the absence of its ordinary occupants. To him, and to the venerable House of\r\nthe Seven Gables, does our story now betake itself, like an owl, bewildered in\r\nthe daylight, and hastening back to his hollow tree.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Judge has not shifted his position for a long while now. He has not stirred\r\nhand or foot, nor withdrawn his eyes so much as a hair’s-breadth from\r\ntheir fixed gaze towards the corner of the room, since the footsteps of\r\nHepzibah and Clifford creaked along the passage, and the outer door was closed\r\ncautiously behind their exit. He holds his watch in his left hand, but clutched\r\nin such a manner that you cannot see the dial-plate. How profound a fit of\r\nmeditation! Or, supposing him asleep, how infantile a quietude of conscience,\r\nand what wholesome order in the gastric region, are betokened by slumber so\r\nentirely undisturbed with starts, cramp, twitches, muttered dreamtalk,\r\ntrumpet-blasts through the nasal organ, or any slightest irregularity of\r\nbreath! You must hold your own breath, to satisfy yourself whether he breathes\r\nat all. It is quite inaudible. You hear the ticking of his watch; his breath\r\nyou do not hear. A most refreshing slumber, doubtless! And yet, the Judge\r\ncannot be asleep. His eyes are open! A veteran politician, such as he, would\r\nnever fall asleep with wide-open eyes, lest some enemy or mischief-maker,\r\ntaking him thus at unawares, should peep through these windows into his\r\nconsciousness, and make strange discoveries among the reminiscences, projects,\r\nhopes, apprehensions, weaknesses, and strong points, which he has heretofore\r\nshared with nobody. A cautious man is proverbially said to sleep with one eye\r\nopen. That may be wisdom. But not with both; for this were heedlessness! No,\r\nno! Judge Pyncheon cannot be asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is odd, however, that a gentleman so burdened with engagements,—and\r\nnoted, too, for punctuality,—should linger thus in an old lonely mansion,\r\nwhich he has never seemed very fond of visiting. The oaken chair, to be sure,\r\nmay tempt him with its roominess. It is, indeed, a spacious, and, allowing for\r\nthe rude age that fashioned it, a moderately easy seat, with capacity enough,\r\nat all events, and offering no restraint to the Judge’s breadth of beam.\r\nA bigger man might find ample accommodation in it. His ancestor, now pictured\r\nupon the wall, with all his English beef about him, used hardly to present a\r\nfront extending from elbow to elbow of this chair, or a base that would cover\r\nits whole cushion. But there are better chairs than this,—mahogany, black\r\nwalnut, rosewood, spring-seated and damask-cushioned, with varied slopes, and\r\ninnumerable artifices to make them easy, and obviate the irksomeness of too\r\ntame an ease,—a score of such might be at Judge Pyncheon’s service.\r\nYes! in a score of drawing-rooms he would be more than welcome. Mamma would\r\nadvance to meet him, with outstretched hand; the virgin daughter, elderly as he\r\nhas now got to be,—an old widower, as he smilingly describes\r\nhimself,—would shake up the cushion for the Judge, and do her pretty\r\nutmost to make him comfortable. For the Judge is a prosperous man. He cherishes\r\nhis schemes, moreover, like other people, and reasonably brighter than most\r\nothers; or did so, at least, as he lay abed this morning, in an agreeable\r\nhalf-drowse, planning the business of the day, and speculating on the\r\nprobabilities of the next fifteen years. With his firm health, and the little\r\ninroad that age has made upon him, fifteen years or twenty—yes, or\r\nperhaps five-and-twenty!—are no more than he may fairly call his own.\r\nFive-and-twenty years for the enjoyment of his real estate in town and country,\r\nhis railroad, bank, and insurance shares, his United States stock,—his\r\nwealth, in short, however invested, now in possession, or soon to be acquired;\r\ntogether with the public honors that have fallen upon him, and the weightier\r\nones that are yet to fall! It is good! It is excellent! It is enough!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStill lingering in the old chair! If the Judge has a little time to throw away,\r\nwhy does not he visit the insurance office, as is his frequent custom, and sit\r\nawhile in one of their leathern-cushioned arm-chairs, listening to the gossip\r\nof the day, and dropping some deeply designed chance-word, which will be\r\ncertain to become the gossip of to-morrow. And have not the bank directors a\r\nmeeting at which it was the Judge’s purpose to be present, and his office\r\nto preside? Indeed they have; and the hour is noted on a card, which is, or\r\nought to be, in Judge Pyncheon’s right vest-pocket. Let him go thither,\r\nand loll at ease upon his moneybags! He has lounged long enough in the old\r\nchair!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was to have been such a busy day. In the first place, the interview with\r\nClifford. Half an hour, by the Judge’s reckoning, was to suffice for\r\nthat; it would probably be less, but—taking into consideration that\r\nHepzibah was first to be dealt with, and that these women are apt to make many\r\nwords where a few would do much better—it might be safest to allow half\r\nan hour. Half an hour? Why, Judge, it is already two hours, by your own\r\nundeviatingly accurate chronometer. Glance your eye down at it and see! Ah; he\r\nwill not give himself the trouble either to bend his head, or elevate his hand,\r\nso as to bring the faithful time-keeper within his range of vision! Time, all\r\nat once, appears to have become a matter of no moment with the Judge!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd has he forgotten all the other items of his memoranda? Clifford’s\r\naffair arranged, he was to meet a State Street broker, who has undertaken to\r\nprocure a heavy percentage, and the best of paper, for a few loose thousands\r\nwhich the Judge happens to have by him, uninvested. The wrinkled note-shaver\r\nwill have taken his railroad trip in vain. Half an hour later, in the street\r\nnext to this, there was to be an auction of real estate, including a portion of\r\nthe old Pyncheon property, originally belonging to Maule’s garden ground.\r\nIt has been alienated from the Pyncheons these four-score years; but the Judge\r\nhad kept it in his eye, and had set his heart on reannexing it to the small\r\ndemesne still left around the Seven Gables; and now, during this odd fit of\r\noblivion, the fatal hammer must have fallen, and transferred our ancient\r\npatrimony to some alien possessor. Possibly, indeed, the sale may have been\r\npostponed till fairer weather. If so, will the Judge make it convenient to be\r\npresent, and favor the auctioneer with his bid, on the proximate occasion?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next affair was to buy a horse for his own driving. The one heretofore his\r\nfavorite stumbled, this very morning, on the road to town, and must be at once\r\ndiscarded. Judge Pyncheon’s neck is too precious to be risked on such a\r\ncontingency as a stumbling steed. Should all the above business be seasonably\r\ngot through with, he might attend the meeting of a charitable society; the very\r\nname of which, however, in the multiplicity of his benevolence, is quite\r\nforgotten; so that this engagement may pass unfulfilled, and no great harm\r\ndone. And if he have time, amid the press of more urgent matters, he must take\r\nmeasures for the renewal of Mrs. Pyncheon’s tombstone, which, the sexton\r\ntells him, has fallen on its marble face, and is cracked quite in twain. She\r\nwas a praiseworthy woman enough, thinks the Judge, in spite of her nervousness,\r\nand the tears that she was so oozy with, and her foolish behavior about the\r\ncoffee; and as she took her departure so seasonably, he will not grudge the\r\nsecond tombstone. It is better, at least, than if she had never needed any! The\r\nnext item on his list was to give orders for some fruit-trees, of a rare\r\nvariety, to be deliverable at his country-seat in the ensuing autumn. Yes, buy\r\nthem, by all means; and may the peaches be luscious in your mouth, Judge\r\nPyncheon! After this comes something more important. A committee of his\r\npolitical party has besought him for a hundred or two of dollars, in addition\r\nto his previous disbursements, towards carrying on the fall campaign. The Judge\r\nis a patriot; the fate of the country is staked on the November election; and\r\nbesides, as will be shadowed forth in another paragraph, he has no trifling\r\nstake of his own in the same great game. He will do what the committee asks;\r\nnay, he will be liberal beyond their expectations; they shall have a check for\r\nfive hundred dollars, and more anon, if it be needed. What next? A decayed\r\nwidow, whose husband was Judge Pyncheon’s early friend, has laid her case\r\nof destitution before him, in a very moving letter. She and her fair daughter\r\nhave scarcely bread to eat. He partly intends to call on her\r\nto-day,—perhaps so—perhaps not,—accordingly as he may happen\r\nto have leisure, and a small bank-note.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnother business, which, however, he puts no great weight on (it is well, you\r\nknow, to be heedful, but not over-anxious, as respects one’s personal\r\nhealth),—another business, then, was to consult his family physician.\r\nAbout what, for Heaven’s sake? Why, it is rather difficult to describe\r\nthe symptoms. A mere dimness of sight and dizziness of brain, was it?—or\r\ndisagreeable choking, or stifling, or gurgling, or bubbling, in the region of\r\nthe thorax, as the anatomists say?—or was it a pretty severe throbbing\r\nand kicking of the heart, rather creditable to him than otherwise, as showing\r\nthat the organ had not been left out of the Judge’s physical contrivance?\r\nNo matter what it was. The doctor probably would smile at the statement of such\r\ntrifles to his professional ear; the Judge would smile in his turn; and meeting\r\none another’s eyes, they would enjoy a hearty laugh together! But a fig\r\nfor medical advice. The Judge will never need it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPray, pray, Judge Pyncheon, look at your watch, Now! What—not a glance!\r\nIt is within ten minutes of the dinner hour! It surely cannot have slipped your\r\nmemory that the dinner of to-day is to be the most important, in its\r\nconsequences, of all the dinners you ever ate. Yes, precisely the most\r\nimportant; although, in the course of your somewhat eminent career, you have\r\nbeen placed high towards the head of the table, at splendid banquets, and have\r\npoured out your festive eloquence to ears yet echoing with Webster’s\r\nmighty organ-tones. No public dinner this, however. It is merely a gathering of\r\nsome dozen or so of friends from several districts of the State; men of\r\ndistinguished character and influence, assembling, almost casually, at the\r\nhouse of a common friend, likewise distinguished, who will make them welcome to\r\na little better than his ordinary fare. Nothing in the way of French cookery,\r\nbut an excellent dinner, nevertheless. Real turtle, we understand, and salmon,\r\ntautog, canvas-backs, pig, English mutton, good roast beef, or dainties of that\r\nserious kind, fit for substantial country gentlemen, as these honorable persons\r\nmostly are. The delicacies of the season, in short, and flavored by a brand of\r\nold Madeira which has been the pride of many seasons. It is the Juno brand; a\r\nglorious wine, fragrant, and full of gentle might; a bottled-up happiness, put\r\nby for use; a golden liquid, worth more than liquid gold; so rare and\r\nadmirable, that veteran wine-bibbers count it among their epochs to have tasted\r\nit! It drives away the heart-ache, and substitutes no head-ache! Could the\r\nJudge but quaff a glass, it might enable him to shake off the unaccountable\r\nlethargy which (for the ten intervening minutes, and five to boot, are already\r\npast) has made him such a laggard at this momentous dinner. It would all but\r\nrevive a dead man! Would you like to sip it now, Judge Pyncheon?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlas, this dinner. Have you really forgotten its true object? Then let us\r\nwhisper it, that you may start at once out of the oaken chair, which really\r\nseems to be enchanted, like the one in Comus, or that in which Moll Pitcher\r\nimprisoned your own grandfather. But ambition is a talisman more powerful than\r\nwitchcraft. Start up, then, and, hurrying through the streets, burst in upon\r\nthe company, that they may begin before the fish is spoiled! They wait for you;\r\nand it is little for your interest that they should wait. These\r\ngentlemen—need you be told it?—have assembled, not without purpose,\r\nfrom every quarter of the State. They are practised politicians, every man of\r\nthem, and skilled to adjust those preliminary measures which steal from the\r\npeople, without its knowledge, the power of choosing its own rulers. The\r\npopular voice, at the next gubernatorial election, though loud as thunder, will\r\nbe really but an echo of what these gentlemen shall speak, under their breath,\r\nat your friend’s festive board. They meet to decide upon their candidate.\r\nThis little knot of subtle schemers will control the convention, and, through\r\nit, dictate to the party. And what worthier candidate,—more wise and\r\nlearned, more noted for philanthropic liberality, truer to safe principles,\r\ntried oftener by public trusts, more spotless in private character, with a\r\nlarger stake in the common welfare, and deeper grounded, by hereditary descent,\r\nin the faith and practice of the Puritans,—what man can be presented for\r\nthe suffrage of the people, so eminently combining all these claims to the\r\nchief-rulership as Judge Pyncheon here before us?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMake haste, then! Do your part! The meed for which you have toiled, and fought,\r\nand climbed, and crept, is ready for your grasp! Be present at this\r\ndinner!—drink a glass or two of that noble wine!—make your pledges\r\nin as low a whisper as you will!—and you rise up from table virtually\r\ngovernor of the glorious old State! Governor Pyncheon of Massachusetts!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd is there no potent and exhilarating cordial in a certainty like this? It\r\nhas been the grand purpose of half your lifetime to obtain it. Now, when there\r\nneeds little more than to signify your acceptance, why do you sit so lumpishly\r\nin your great-great-grandfather’s oaken chair, as if preferring it to the\r\ngubernatorial one? We have all heard of King Log; but, in these jostling times,\r\none of that royal kindred will hardly win the race for an elective\r\nchief-magistracy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell; it is absolutely too late for dinner! Turtle, salmon, tautog, woodcock,\r\nboiled turkey, South-Down mutton, pig, roast-beef, have vanished, or exist only\r\nin fragments, with lukewarm potatoes, and gravies crusted over with cold fat.\r\nThe Judge, had he done nothing else, would have achieved wonders with his knife\r\nand fork. It was he, you know, of whom it used to be said, in reference to his\r\nogre-like appetite, that his Creator made him a great animal, but that the\r\ndinner-hour made him a great beast. Persons of his large sensual endowments\r\nmust claim indulgence, at their feeding-time. But, for once, the Judge is\r\nentirely too late for dinner! Too late, we fear, even to join the party at\r\ntheir wine! The guests are warm and merry; they have given up the Judge; and,\r\nconcluding that the Free-Soilers have him, they will fix upon another\r\ncandidate. Were our friend now to stalk in among them, with that wide-open\r\nstare, at once wild and stolid, his ungenial presence would be apt to change\r\ntheir cheer. Neither would it be seemly in Judge Pyncheon, generally so\r\nscrupulous in his attire, to show himself at a dinner-table with that crimson\r\nstain upon his shirt-bosom. By the bye, how came it there? It is an ugly sight,\r\nat any rate; and the wisest way for the Judge is to button his coat closely\r\nover his breast, and, taking his horse and chaise from the livery stable, to\r\nmake all speed to his own house. There, after a glass of brandy and water, and\r\na mutton-chop, a beefsteak, a broiled fowl, or some such hasty little dinner\r\nand supper all in one, he had better spend the evening by the fireside. He must\r\ntoast his slippers a long while, in order to get rid of the chilliness which\r\nthe air of this vile old house has sent curdling through his veins.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUp, therefore, Judge Pyncheon, up! You have lost a day. But to-morrow will be\r\nhere anon. Will you rise, betimes, and make the most of it? To-morrow.\r\nTo-morrow! To-morrow. We, that are alive, may rise betimes to-morrow. As for\r\nhim that has died to-day, his morrow will be the resurrection morn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile the twilight is glooming upward out of the corners of the room. The\r\nshadows of the tall furniture grow deeper, and at first become more definite;\r\nthen, spreading wider, they lose their distinctness of outline in the dark gray\r\ntide of oblivion, as it were, that creeps slowly over the various objects, and\r\nthe one human figure sitting in the midst of them. The gloom has not entered\r\nfrom without; it has brooded here all day, and now, taking its own inevitable\r\ntime, will possess itself of everything. The Judge’s face, indeed, rigid\r\nand singularly white, refuses to melt into this universal solvent. Fainter and\r\nfainter grows the light. It is as if another double-handful of darkness had\r\nbeen scattered through the air. Now it is no longer gray, but sable. There is\r\nstill a faint appearance at the window; neither a glow, nor a gleam, nor a\r\nglimmer,—any phrase of light would express something far brighter than\r\nthis doubtful perception, or sense, rather, that there is a window there. Has\r\nit yet vanished? No!—yes!—not quite! And there is still the swarthy\r\nwhiteness,—we shall venture to marry these ill-agreeing words,—the\r\nswarthy whiteness of Judge Pyncheon’s face. The features are all gone:\r\nthere is only the paleness of them left. And how looks it now? There is no\r\nwindow! There is no face! An infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated\r\nsight! Where is our universe? All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in\r\nchaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring\r\nabout in quest of what was once a world!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIs there no other sound? One other, and a fearful one. It is the ticking of the\r\nJudge’s watch, which, ever since Hepzibah left the room in search of\r\nClifford, he has been holding in his hand. Be the cause what it may, this\r\nlittle, quiet, never-ceasing throb of Time’s pulse, repeating its small\r\nstrokes with such busy regularity, in Judge Pyncheon’s motionless hand,\r\nhas an effect of terror, which we do not find in any other accompaniment of the\r\nscene.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, listen! That puff of the breeze was louder. It had a tone unlike the\r\ndreary and sullen one which has bemoaned itself, and afflicted all mankind with\r\nmiserable sympathy, for five days past. The wind has veered about! It now comes\r\nboisterously from the northwest, and, taking hold of the aged framework of the\r\nSeven Gables, gives it a shake, like a wrestler that would try strength with\r\nhis antagonist. Another and another sturdy tussle with the blast! The old house\r\ncreaks again, and makes a vociferous but somewhat unintelligible bellowing in\r\nits sooty throat (the big flue, we mean, of its wide chimney), partly in\r\ncomplaint at the rude wind, but rather, as befits their century and a half of\r\nhostile intimacy, in tough defiance. A rumbling kind of a bluster roars behind\r\nthe fire-board. A door has slammed above stairs. A window, perhaps, has been\r\nleft open, or else is driven in by an unruly gust. It is not to be conceived,\r\nbefore-hand, what wonderful wind-instruments are these old timber mansions, and\r\nhow haunted with the strangest noises, which immediately begin to sing, and\r\nsigh, and sob, and shriek,—and to smite with sledge-hammers, airy but\r\nponderous, in some distant chamber,—and to tread along the entries as\r\nwith stately footsteps, and rustle up and down the staircase, as with silks\r\nmiraculously stiff,—whenever the gale catches the house with a window\r\nopen, and gets fairly into it. Would that we were not an attendant spirit here!\r\nIt is too awful! This clamor of the wind through the lonely house; the\r\nJudge’s quietude, as he sits invisible; and that pertinacious ticking of\r\nhis watch!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs regards Judge Pyncheon’s invisibility, however, that matter will soon\r\nbe remedied. The northwest wind has swept the sky clear. The window is\r\ndistinctly seen. Through its panes, moreover, we dimly catch the sweep of the\r\ndark, clustering foliage outside, fluttering with a constant irregularity of\r\nmovement, and letting in a peep of starlight, now here, now there. Oftener than\r\nany other object, these glimpses illuminate the Judge’s face. But here\r\ncomes more effectual light. Observe that silvery dance upon the upper branches\r\nof the pear-tree, and now a little lower, and now on the whole mass of boughs,\r\nwhile, through their shifting intricacies, the moonbeams fall aslant into the\r\nroom. They play over the Judge’s figure and show that he has not stirred\r\nthroughout the hours of darkness. They follow the shadows, in changeful sport,\r\nacross his unchanging features. They gleam upon his watch. His grasp conceals\r\nthe dial-plate,—but we know that the faithful hands have met; for one of\r\nthe city clocks tells midnight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA man of sturdy understanding, like Judge Pyncheon, cares no more for twelve\r\no’clock at night than for the corresponding hour of noon. However just\r\nthe parallel drawn, in some of the preceding pages, between his Puritan\r\nancestor and himself, it fails in this point. The Pyncheon of two centuries\r\nago, in common with most of his contemporaries, professed his full belief in\r\nspiritual ministrations, although reckoning them chiefly of a malignant\r\ncharacter. The Pyncheon of to-night, who sits in yonder arm-chair, believes in\r\nno such nonsense. Such, at least, was his creed, some few hours since. His hair\r\nwill not bristle, therefore, at the stories which—in times when\r\nchimney-corners had benches in them, where old people sat poking into the ashes\r\nof the past, and raking out traditions like live coals—used to be told\r\nabout this very room of his ancestral house. In fact, these tales are too\r\nabsurd to bristle even childhood’s hair. What sense, meaning, or moral,\r\nfor example, such as even ghost-stories should be susceptible of, can be traced\r\nin the ridiculous legend, that, at midnight, all the dead Pyncheons are bound\r\nto assemble in this parlor? And, pray, for what? Why, to see whether the\r\nportrait of their ancestor still keeps its place upon the wall, in compliance\r\nwith his testamentary directions! Is it worth while to come out of their graves\r\nfor that?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe are tempted to make a little sport with the idea. Ghost-stories are hardly\r\nto be treated seriously any longer. The family-party of the defunct Pyncheons,\r\nwe presume, goes off in this wise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFirst comes the ancestor himself, in his black cloak, steeple-hat, and\r\ntrunk-breeches, girt about the waist with a leathern belt, in which hangs his\r\nsteel-hilted sword; he has a long staff in his hand, such as gentlemen in\r\nadvanced life used to carry, as much for the dignity of the thing as for the\r\nsupport to be derived from it. He looks up at the portrait; a thing of no\r\nsubstance, gazing at its own painted image! All is safe. The picture is still\r\nthere. The purpose of his brain has been kept sacred thus long after the man\r\nhimself has sprouted up in graveyard grass. See! he lifts his ineffectual hand,\r\nand tries the frame. All safe! But is that a smile?—is it not, rather a\r\nfrown of deadly import, that darkens over the shadow of his features? The stout\r\nColonel is dissatisfied! So decided is his look of discontent as to impart\r\nadditional distinctness to his features; through which, nevertheless, the\r\nmoonlight passes, and flickers on the wall beyond. Something has strangely\r\nvexed the ancestor! With a grim shake of the head, he turns away. Here come\r\nother Pyncheons, the whole tribe, in their half a dozen generations, jostling\r\nand elbowing one another, to reach the picture. We behold aged men and\r\ngrandames, a clergyman with the Puritanic stiffness still in his garb and mien,\r\nand a red-coated officer of the old French war; and there comes the\r\nshop-keeping Pyncheon of a century ago, with the ruffles turned back from his\r\nwrists; and there the periwigged and brocaded gentleman of the artist’s\r\nlegend, with the beautiful and pensive Alice, who brings no pride out of her\r\nvirgin grave. All try the picture-frame. What do these ghostly people seek? A\r\nmother lifts her child, that his little hands may touch it! There is evidently\r\na mystery about the picture, that perplexes these poor Pyncheons when they\r\nought to be at rest. In a corner, meanwhile, stands the figure of an elderly\r\nman, in a leathern jerkin and breeches, with a carpenter’s rule sticking\r\nout of his side pocket; he points his finger at the bearded Colonel and his\r\ndescendants, nodding, jeering, mocking, and finally bursting into obstreperous,\r\nthough inaudible laughter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIndulging our fancy in this freak, we have partly lost the power of restraint\r\nand guidance. We distinguish an unlooked-for figure in our visionary scene.\r\nAmong those ancestral people there is a young man, dressed in the very fashion\r\nof to-day: he wears a dark frock-coat, almost destitute of skirts, gray\r\npantaloons, gaiter boots of patent leather, and has a finely wrought gold chain\r\nacross his breast, and a little silver-headed whalebone stick in his hand. Were\r\nwe to meet this figure at noonday, we should greet him as young Jaffrey\r\nPyncheon, the Judge’s only surviving child, who has been spending the\r\nlast two years in foreign travel. If still in life, how comes his shadow\r\nhither? If dead, what a misfortune! The old Pyncheon property, together with\r\nthe great estate acquired by the young man’s father, would devolve on\r\nwhom? On poor, foolish Clifford, gaunt Hepzibah, and rustic little Phœbe! But\r\nanother and a greater marvel greets us! Can we believe our eyes? A stout,\r\nelderly gentleman has made his appearance; he has an aspect of eminent\r\nrespectability, wears a black coat and pantaloons, of roomy width, and might be\r\npronounced scrupulously neat in his attire, but for a broad crimson stain\r\nacross his snowy neckcloth and down his shirt-bosom. Is it the Judge, or no?\r\nHow can it be Judge Pyncheon? We discern his figure, as plainly as the\r\nflickering moonbeams can show us anything, still seated in the oaken chair! Be\r\nthe apparition whose it may, it advances to the picture, seems to seize the\r\nframe, tries to peep behind it, and turns away, with a frown as black as the\r\nancestral one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe fantastic scene just hinted at must by no means be considered as forming an\r\nactual portion of our story. We were betrayed into this brief extravagance by\r\nthe quiver of the moonbeams; they dance hand-in-hand with shadows, and are\r\nreflected in the looking-glass, which, you are aware, is always a kind of\r\nwindow or doorway into the spiritual world. We needed relief, moreover, from\r\nour too long and exclusive contemplation of that figure in the chair. This wild\r\nwind, too, has tossed our thoughts into strange confusion, but without tearing\r\nthem away from their one determined centre. Yonder leaden Judge sits immovably\r\nupon our soul. Will he never stir again? We shall go mad unless he stirs! You\r\nmay the better estimate his quietude by the fearlessness of a little mouse,\r\nwhich sits on its hind legs, in a streak of moonlight, close by Judge\r\nPyncheon’s foot, and seems to meditate a journey of exploration over this\r\ngreat black bulk. Ha! what has startled the nimble little mouse? It is the\r\nvisage of grimalkin, outside of the window, where he appears to have posted\r\nhimself for a deliberate watch. This grimalkin has a very ugly look. Is it a\r\ncat watching for a mouse, or the devil for a human soul? Would we could scare\r\nhim from the window!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThank Heaven, the night is well-nigh past! The moonbeams have no longer so\r\nsilvery a gleam, nor contrast so strongly with the blackness of the shadows\r\namong which they fall. They are paler now; the shadows look gray, not black.\r\nThe boisterous wind is hushed. What is the hour? Ah! the watch has at last\r\nceased to tick; for the Judge’s forgetful fingers neglected to wind it\r\nup, as usual, at ten o’clock, being half an hour or so before his\r\nordinary bedtime,—and it has run down, for the first time in five years.\r\nBut the great world-clock of Time still keeps its beat. The dreary\r\nnight—for, oh, how dreary seems its haunted waste, behind us!—gives\r\nplace to a fresh, transparent, cloudless morn. Blessed, blessed radiance! The\r\ndaybeam—even what little of it finds its way into this always dusky\r\nparlor—seems part of the universal benediction, annulling evil, and\r\nrendering all goodness possible, and happiness attainable. Will Judge Pyncheon\r\nnow rise up from his chair? Will he go forth, and receive the early sunbeams on\r\nhis brow? Will he begin this new day,—which God has smiled upon, and\r\nblessed, and given to mankind,—will he begin it with better purposes than\r\nthe many that have been spent amiss? Or are all the deep-laid schemes of\r\nyesterday as stubborn in his heart, and as busy in his brain, as ever?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this latter case, there is much to do. Will the Judge still insist with\r\nHepzibah on the interview with Clifford? Will he buy a safe, elderly\r\ngentleman’s horse? Will he persuade the purchaser of the old Pyncheon\r\nproperty to relinquish the bargain in his favor? Will he see his family\r\nphysician, and obtain a medicine that shall preserve him, to be an honor and\r\nblessing to his race, until the utmost term of patriarchal longevity? Will\r\nJudge Pyncheon, above all, make due apologies to that company of honorable\r\nfriends, and satisfy them that his absence from the festive board was\r\nunavoidable, and so fully retrieve himself in their good opinion that he shall\r\nyet be Governor of Massachusetts? And all these great purposes accomplished,\r\nwill he walk the streets again, with that dog-day smile of elaborate\r\nbenevolence, sultry enough to tempt flies to come and buzz in it? Or will he,\r\nafter the tomb-like seclusion of the past day and night, go forth a humbled and\r\nrepentant man, sorrowful, gentle, seeking no profit, shrinking from worldly\r\nhonor, hardly daring to love God, but bold to love his fellow man, and to do\r\nhim what good he may? Will he bear about with him,—no odious grin of\r\nfeigned benignity, insolent in its pretence, and loathsome in its\r\nfalsehood,—but the tender sadness of a contrite heart, broken, at last,\r\nbeneath its own weight of sin? For it is our belief, whatever show of honor he\r\nmay have piled upon it, that there was heavy sin at the base of this\r\nman’s being.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRise up, Judge Pyncheon! The morning sunshine glimmers through the foliage,\r\nand, beautiful and holy as it is, shuns not to kindle up your face. Rise up,\r\nthou subtle, worldly, selfish, iron-hearted hypocrite, and make thy choice\r\nwhether still to be subtle, worldly, selfish, iron-hearted, and hypocritical,\r\nor to tear these sins out of thy nature, though they bring the lifeblood with\r\nthem! The Avenger is upon thee! Rise up, before it be too late!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat! Thou art not stirred by this last appeal? No, not a jot! And there we see\r\na fly,—one of your common house-flies, such as are always buzzing on the\r\nwindow-pane,—which has smelt out Governor Pyncheon, and alights, now on\r\nhis forehead, now on his chin, and now, Heaven help us! is creeping over the\r\nbridge of his nose, towards the would-be chief-magistrate’s wide-open\r\neyes! Canst thou not brush the fly away? Art thou too sluggish? Thou man, that\r\nhadst so many busy projects yesterday! Art thou too weak, that wast so\r\npowerful? Not brush away a fly? Nay, then, we give thee up!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd hark! the shop-bell rings. After hours like these latter ones, through\r\nwhich we have borne our heavy tale, it is good to be made sensible that there\r\nis a living world, and that even this old, lonely mansion retains some manner\r\nof connection with it. We breathe more freely, emerging from Judge\r\nPyncheon’s presence into the street before the Seven Gables.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap19\"></a>XIX.<br>\r\nAlice’s Posies</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nUncle Venner, trundling a wheelbarrow, was the earliest person stirring in the\r\nneighborhood the day after the storm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPyncheon Street, in front of the House of the Seven Gables, was a far\r\npleasanter scene than a by-lane, confined by shabby fences, and bordered with\r\nwooden dwellings of the meaner class, could reasonably be expected to present.\r\nNature made sweet amends, that morning, for the five unkindly days which had\r\npreceded it. It would have been enough to live for, merely to look up at the\r\nwide benediction of the sky, or as much of it as was visible between the\r\nhouses, genial once more with sunshine. Every object was agreeable, whether to\r\nbe gazed at in the breadth, or examined more minutely. Such, for example, were\r\nthe well-washed pebbles and gravel of the sidewalk; even the sky-reflecting\r\npools in the centre of the street; and the grass, now freshly verdant, that\r\ncrept along the base of the fences, on the other side of which, if one peeped\r\nover, was seen the multifarious growth of gardens. Vegetable productions, of\r\nwhatever kind, seemed more than negatively happy, in the juicy warmth and\r\nabundance of their life. The Pyncheon Elm, throughout its great circumference,\r\nwas all alive, and full of the morning sun and a sweet-tempered little breeze,\r\nwhich lingered within this verdant sphere, and set a thousand leafy tongues\r\na-whispering all at once. This aged tree appeared to have suffered nothing from\r\nthe gale. It had kept its boughs unshattered, and its full complement of\r\nleaves; and the whole in perfect verdure, except a single branch, that, by the\r\nearlier change with which the elm-tree sometimes prophesies the autumn, had\r\nbeen transmuted to bright gold. It was like the golden branch that gained\r\nAeneas and the Sibyl admittance into Hades.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis one mystic branch hung down before the main entrance of the Seven Gables,\r\nso nigh the ground that any passer-by might have stood on tiptoe and plucked it\r\noff. Presented at the door, it would have been a symbol of his right to enter,\r\nand be made acquainted with all the secrets of the house. So little faith is\r\ndue to external appearance, that there was really an inviting aspect over the\r\nvenerable edifice, conveying an idea that its history must be a decorous and\r\nhappy one, and such as would be delightful for a fireside tale. Its windows\r\ngleamed cheerfully in the slanting sunlight. The lines and tufts of green moss,\r\nhere and there, seemed pledges of familiarity and sisterhood with Nature; as if\r\nthis human dwelling-place, being of such old date, had established its\r\nprescriptive title among primeval oaks and whatever other objects, by virtue of\r\ntheir long continuance, have acquired a gracious right to be. A person of\r\nimaginative temperament, while passing by the house, would turn, once and\r\nagain, and peruse it well: its many peaks, consenting together in the clustered\r\nchimney; the deep projection over its basement-story; the arched window,\r\nimparting a look, if not of grandeur, yet of antique gentility, to the broken\r\nportal over which it opened; the luxuriance of gigantic burdocks, near the\r\nthreshold; he would note all these characteristics, and be conscious of\r\nsomething deeper than he saw. He would conceive the mansion to have been the\r\nresidence of the stubborn old Puritan, Integrity, who, dying in some forgotten\r\ngeneration, had left a blessing in all its rooms and chambers, the efficacy of\r\nwhich was to be seen in the religion, honesty, moderate competence, or upright\r\npoverty and solid happiness, of his descendants, to this day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne object, above all others, would take root in the imaginative\r\nobserver’s memory. It was the great tuft of flowers,—weeds, you\r\nwould have called them, only a week ago,—the tuft of crimson-spotted\r\nflowers, in the angle between the two front gables. The old people used to give\r\nthem the name of Alice’s Posies, in remembrance of fair Alice Pyncheon,\r\nwho was believed to have brought their seeds from Italy. They were flaunting in\r\nrich beauty and full bloom to-day, and seemed, as it were, a mystic expression\r\nthat something within the house was consummated.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was but little after sunrise, when Uncle Venner made his appearance, as\r\naforesaid, impelling a wheelbarrow along the street. He was going his matutinal\r\nrounds to collect cabbage-leaves, turnip-tops, potato-skins, and the\r\nmiscellaneous refuse of the dinner-pot, which the thrifty housewives of the\r\nneighborhood were accustomed to put aside, as fit only to feed a pig. Uncle\r\nVenner’s pig was fed entirely, and kept in prime order, on these\r\neleemosynary contributions; insomuch that the patched philosopher used to\r\npromise that, before retiring to his farm, he would make a feast of the portly\r\ngrunter, and invite all his neighbors to partake of the joints and spare-ribs\r\nwhich they had helped to fatten. Miss Hepzibah Pyncheon’s housekeeping\r\nhad so greatly improved, since Clifford became a member of the family, that her\r\nshare of the banquet would have been no lean one; and Uncle Venner,\r\naccordingly, was a good deal disappointed not to find the large earthen pan,\r\nfull of fragmentary eatables, that ordinarily awaited his coming at the back\r\ndoorstep of the Seven Gables.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I never knew Miss Hepzibah so forgetful before,” said the\r\npatriarch to himself. “She must have had a dinner yesterday,—no\r\nquestion of that! She always has one, nowadays. So where’s the pot-liquor\r\nand potato-skins, I ask? Shall I knock, and see if she’s stirring yet?\r\nNo, no,—’twon’t do! If little Phœbe was about the house, I\r\nshould not mind knocking; but Miss Hepzibah, likely as not, would scowl down at\r\nme out of the window, and look cross, even if she felt pleasantly. So,\r\nI’ll come back at noon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith these reflections, the old man was shutting the gate of the little\r\nback-yard. Creaking on its hinges, however, like every other gate and door\r\nabout the premises, the sound reached the ears of the occupant of the northern\r\ngable, one of the windows of which had a side-view towards the gate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good-morning, Uncle Venner!” said the daguerreotypist, leaning out\r\nof the window. “Do you hear nobody stirring?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not a soul,” said the man of patches. “But that’s no\r\nwonder. ’Tis barely half an hour past sunrise, yet. But I’m really\r\nglad to see you, Mr. Holgrave! There’s a strange, lonesome look about\r\nthis side of the house; so that my heart misgave me, somehow or other, and I\r\nfelt as if there was nobody alive in it. The front of the house looks a good\r\ndeal cheerier; and Alice’s Posies are blooming there beautifully; and if\r\nI were a young man, Mr. Holgrave, my sweetheart should have one of those\r\nflowers in her bosom, though I risked my neck climbing for it! Well, and did\r\nthe wind keep you awake last night?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It did, indeed!” answered the artist, smiling. “If I were a\r\nbeliever in ghosts,—and I don’t quite know whether I am or\r\nnot,—I should have concluded that all the old Pyncheons were running riot\r\nin the lower rooms, especially in Miss Hepzibah’s part of the house. But\r\nit is very quiet now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Miss Hepzibah will be apt to over-sleep herself, after being\r\ndisturbed, all night, with the racket,” said Uncle Venner. “But it\r\nwould be odd, now, wouldn’t it, if the Judge had taken both his cousins\r\ninto the country along with him? I saw him go into the shop yesterday.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“At what hour?” inquired Holgrave.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, along in the forenoon,” said the old man. “Well, well! I\r\nmust go my rounds, and so must my wheelbarrow. But I’ll be back here at\r\ndinner-time; for my pig likes a dinner as well as a breakfast. No meal-time,\r\nand no sort of victuals, ever seems to come amiss to my pig. Good morning to\r\nyou! And, Mr. Holgrave, if I were a young man, like you, I’d get one of\r\nAlice’s Posies, and keep it in water till Phœbe comes back.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have heard,” said the daguerreotypist, as he drew in his head,\r\n“that the water of Maule’s well suits those flowers best.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere the conversation ceased, and Uncle Venner went on his way. For half an\r\nhour longer, nothing disturbed the repose of the Seven Gables; nor was there\r\nany visitor, except a carrier-boy, who, as he passed the front doorstep, threw\r\ndown one of his newspapers; for Hepzibah, of late, had regularly taken it in.\r\nAfter a while, there came a fat woman, making prodigious speed, and stumbling\r\nas she ran up the steps of the shop-door. Her face glowed with fire-heat, and,\r\nit being a pretty warm morning, she bubbled and hissed, as it were, as if all\r\na-fry with chimney-warmth, and summer-warmth, and the warmth of her own\r\ncorpulent velocity. She tried the shop-door; it was fast. She tried it again,\r\nwith so angry a jar that the bell tinkled angrily back at her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The deuce take Old Maid Pyncheon!” muttered the irascible\r\nhousewife. “Think of her pretending to set up a cent-shop, and then lying\r\nabed till noon! These are what she calls gentlefolk’s airs, I suppose!\r\nBut I’ll either start her ladyship, or break the door down!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe shook it accordingly, and the bell, having a spiteful little temper of its\r\nown, rang obstreperously, making its remonstrances heard,—not, indeed, by\r\nthe ears for which they were intended,—but by a good lady on the opposite\r\nside of the street. She opened the window, and addressed the impatient\r\napplicant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You’ll find nobody there, Mrs. Gubbins.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I must and will find somebody here!” cried Mrs. Gubbins,\r\ninflicting another outrage on the bell. “I want a half-pound of pork, to\r\nfry some first-rate flounders for Mr. Gubbins’s breakfast; and, lady or\r\nnot, Old Maid Pyncheon shall get up and serve me with it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But do hear reason, Mrs. Gubbins!” responded the lady opposite.\r\n“She, and her brother too, have both gone to their cousin’s, Judge\r\nPyncheon’s at his country-seat. There’s not a soul in the house,\r\nbut that young daguerreotype-man that sleeps in the north gable. I saw old\r\nHepzibah and Clifford go away yesterday; and a queer couple of ducks they were,\r\npaddling through the mud-puddles! They’re gone, I’ll assure\r\nyou.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And how do you know they’re gone to the Judge’s?”\r\nasked Mrs. Gubbins. “He’s a rich man; and there’s been a\r\nquarrel between him and Hepzibah this many a day, because he won’t give\r\nher a living. That’s the main reason of her setting up a\r\ncent-shop.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know that well enough,” said the neighbor. “But\r\nthey’re gone,—that’s one thing certain. And who but a blood\r\nrelation, that couldn’t help himself, I ask you, would take in that\r\nawful-tempered old maid, and that dreadful Clifford? That’s it, you may\r\nbe sure.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Gubbins took her departure, still brimming over with hot wrath against the\r\nabsent Hepzibah. For another half-hour, or, perhaps, considerably more, there\r\nwas almost as much quiet on the outside of the house as within. The elm,\r\nhowever, made a pleasant, cheerful, sunny sigh, responsive to the breeze that\r\nwas elsewhere imperceptible; a swarm of insects buzzed merrily under its\r\ndrooping shadow, and became specks of light whenever they darted into the\r\nsunshine; a locust sang, once or twice, in some inscrutable seclusion of the\r\ntree; and a solitary little bird, with plumage of pale gold, came and hovered\r\nabout Alice’s Posies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last our small acquaintance, Ned Higgins, trudged up the street, on his way\r\nto school; and happening, for the first time in a fortnight, to be the\r\npossessor of a cent, he could by no means get past the shop-door of the Seven\r\nGables. But it would not open. Again and again, however, and half a dozen other\r\nagains, with the inexorable pertinacity of a child intent upon some object\r\nimportant to itself, did he renew his efforts for admittance. He had,\r\ndoubtless, set his heart upon an elephant; or, possibly, with Hamlet, he meant\r\nto eat a crocodile. In response to his more violent attacks, the bell gave, now\r\nand then, a moderate tinkle, but could not be stirred into clamor by any\r\nexertion of the little fellow’s childish and tiptoe strength. Holding by\r\nthe door-handle, he peeped through a crevice of the curtain, and saw that the\r\ninner door, communicating with the passage towards the parlor, was closed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Miss Pyncheon!” screamed the child, rapping on the window-pane,\r\n“I want an elephant!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere being no answer to several repetitions of the summons, Ned began to grow\r\nimpatient; and his little pot of passion quickly boiling over, he picked up a\r\nstone, with a naughty purpose to fling it through the window; at the same time\r\nblubbering and sputtering with wrath. A man—one of two who happened to be\r\npassing by—caught the urchin’s arm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the trouble, old gentleman?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want old Hepzibah, or Phœbe, or any of them!” answered Ned,\r\nsobbing. “They won’t open the door; and I can’t get my\r\nelephant!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Go to school, you little scamp!” said the man.\r\n“There’s another cent-shop round the corner. ’Tis very\r\nstrange, Dixey,” added he to his companion, “what’s become of\r\nall these Pyncheon’s! Smith, the livery-stable keeper, tells me Judge\r\nPyncheon put his horse up yesterday, to stand till after dinner, and has not\r\ntaken him away yet. And one of the Judge’s hired men has been in, this\r\nmorning, to make inquiry about him. He’s a kind of person, they say, that\r\nseldom breaks his habits, or stays out o’ nights.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, he’ll turn up safe enough!” said Dixey. “And as\r\nfor Old Maid Pyncheon, take my word for it, she has run in debt, and gone off\r\nfrom her creditors. I foretold, you remember, the first morning she set up\r\nshop, that her devilish scowl would frighten away customers. They\r\ncouldn’t stand it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I never thought she’d make it go,” remarked his friend.\r\n“This business of cent-shops is overdone among the women-folks. My wife\r\ntried it, and lost five dollars on her outlay!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Poor business!” said Dixey, shaking his head. “Poor\r\nbusiness!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the course of the morning, there were various other attempts to open a\r\ncommunication with the supposed inhabitants of this silent and impenetrable\r\nmansion. The man of root-beer came, in his neatly painted wagon, with a couple\r\nof dozen full bottles, to be exchanged for empty ones; the baker, with a lot of\r\ncrackers which Hepzibah had ordered for her retail custom; the butcher, with a\r\nnice titbit which he fancied she would be eager to secure for Clifford. Had any\r\nobserver of these proceedings been aware of the fearful secret hidden within\r\nthe house, it would have affected him with a singular shape and modification of\r\nhorror, to see the current of human life making this small eddy\r\nhereabouts,—whirling sticks, straws and all such trifles, round and\r\nround, right over the black depth where a dead corpse lay unseen!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe butcher was so much in earnest with his sweetbread of lamb, or whatever the\r\ndainty might be, that he tried every accessible door of the Seven Gables, and\r\nat length came round again to the shop, where he ordinarily found admittance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s a nice article, and I know the old lady would jump at\r\nit,” said he to himself. “She can’t be gone away! In fifteen\r\nyears that I have driven my cart through Pyncheon Street, I’ve never\r\nknown her to be away from home; though often enough, to be sure, a man might\r\nknock all day without bringing her to the door. But that was when she’d\r\nonly herself to provide for.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPeeping through the same crevice of the curtain where, only a little while\r\nbefore, the urchin of elephantine appetite had peeped, the butcher beheld the\r\ninner door, not closed, as the child had seen it, but ajar, and almost wide\r\nopen. However it might have happened, it was the fact. Through the passage-way\r\nthere was a dark vista into the lighter but still obscure interior of the\r\nparlor. It appeared to the butcher that he could pretty clearly discern what\r\nseemed to be the stalwart legs, clad in black pantaloons, of a man sitting in a\r\nlarge oaken chair, the back of which concealed all the remainder of his figure.\r\nThis contemptuous tranquillity on the part of an occupant of the house, in\r\nresponse to the butcher’s indefatigable efforts to attract notice, so\r\npiqued the man of flesh that he determined to withdraw.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“So,” thought he, “there sits Old Maid Pyncheon’s\r\nbloody brother, while I’ve been giving myself all this trouble! Why, if a\r\nhog hadn’t more manners, I’d stick him! I call it demeaning a\r\nman’s business to trade with such people; and from this time forth, if\r\nthey want a sausage or an ounce of liver, they shall run after the cart for\r\nit!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe tossed the titbit angrily into his cart, and drove off in a pet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNot a great while afterwards there was a sound of music turning the corner and\r\napproaching down the street, with several intervals of silence, and then a\r\nrenewed and nearer outbreak of brisk melody. A mob of children was seen moving\r\nonward, or stopping, in unison with the sound, which appeared to proceed from\r\nthe centre of the throng; so that they were loosely bound together by slender\r\nstrains of harmony, and drawn along captive; with ever and anon an accession of\r\nsome little fellow in an apron and straw-hat, capering forth from door or\r\ngateway. Arriving under the shadow of the Pyncheon Elm, it proved to be the\r\nItalian boy, who, with his monkey and show of puppets, had once before played\r\nhis hurdy-gurdy beneath the arched window. The pleasant face of\r\nPhœbe—and doubtless, too, the liberal recompense which she had flung\r\nhim—still dwelt in his remembrance. His expressive features kindled up,\r\nas he recognized the spot where this trifling incident of his erratic life had\r\nchanced. He entered the neglected yard (now wilder than ever, with its growth\r\nof hog-weed and burdock), stationed himself on the doorstep of the main\r\nentrance, and, opening his show-box, began to play. Each individual of the\r\nautomatic community forthwith set to work, according to his or her proper\r\nvocation: the monkey, taking off his Highland bonnet, bowed and scraped to the\r\nby-standers most obsequiously, with ever an observant eye to pick up a stray\r\ncent; and the young foreigner himself, as he turned the crank of his machine,\r\nglanced upward to the arched window, expectant of a presence that would make\r\nhis music the livelier and sweeter. The throng of children stood near; some on\r\nthe sidewalk; some within the yard; two or three establishing themselves on the\r\nvery door-step; and one squatting on the threshold. Meanwhile, the locust kept\r\nsinging in the great old Pyncheon Elm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t hear anybody in the house,” said one of the children\r\nto another. “The monkey won’t pick up anything here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is somebody at home,” affirmed the urchin on the threshold.\r\n“I heard a step!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStill the young Italian’s eye turned sidelong upward; and it really\r\nseemed as if the touch of genuine, though slight and almost playful, emotion\r\ncommunicated a juicier sweetness to the dry, mechanical process of his\r\nminstrelsy. These wanderers are readily responsive to any natural\r\nkindness—be it no more than a smile, or a word itself not understood, but\r\nonly a warmth in it—which befalls them on the roadside of life. They\r\nremember these things, because they are the little enchantments which, for the\r\ninstant,—for the space that reflects a landscape in a\r\nsoap-bubble,—build up a home about them. Therefore, the Italian boy would\r\nnot be discouraged by the heavy silence with which the old house seemed\r\nresolute to clog the vivacity of his instrument. He persisted in his melodious\r\nappeals; he still looked upward, trusting that his dark, alien countenance\r\nwould soon be brightened by Phœbe’s sunny aspect. Neither could he be\r\nwilling to depart without again beholding Clifford, whose sensibility, like\r\nPhœbe’s smile, had talked a kind of heart’s language to the\r\nforeigner. He repeated all his music over and over again, until his auditors\r\nwere getting weary. So were the little wooden people in his show-box, and the\r\nmonkey most of all. There was no response, save the singing of the locust.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No children live in this house,” said a schoolboy, at last.\r\n“Nobody lives here but an old maid and an old man. You’ll get\r\nnothing here! Why don’t you go along?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You fool, you, why do you tell him?” whispered a shrewd little\r\nYankee, caring nothing for the music, but a good deal for the cheap rate at\r\nwhich it was had. “Let him play as he likes! If there’s nobody to\r\npay him, that’s his own lookout!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnce more, however, the Italian ran over his round of melodies. To the common\r\nobserver—who could understand nothing of the case, except the music and\r\nthe sunshine on the hither side of the door—it might have been amusing to\r\nwatch the pertinacity of the street-performer. Will he succeed at last? Will\r\nthat stubborn door be suddenly flung open? Will a group of joyous children, the\r\nyoung ones of the house, come dancing, shouting, laughing, into the open air,\r\nand cluster round the show-box, looking with eager merriment at the puppets,\r\nand tossing each a copper for long-tailed Mammon, the monkey, to pick up?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut to us, who know the inner heart of the Seven Gables as well as its exterior\r\nface, there is a ghastly effect in this repetition of light popular tunes at\r\nits door-step. It would be an ugly business, indeed, if Judge Pyncheon (who\r\nwould not have cared a fig for Paganini’s fiddle in his most harmonious\r\nmood) should make his appearance at the door, with a bloody shirt-bosom, and a\r\ngrim frown on his swarthily white visage, and motion the foreign vagabond away!\r\nWas ever before such a grinding out of jigs and waltzes, where nobody was in\r\nthe cue to dance? Yes, very often. This contrast, or intermingling of tragedy\r\nwith mirth, happens daily, hourly, momently. The gloomy and desolate old house,\r\ndeserted of life, and with awful Death sitting sternly in its solitude, was the\r\nemblem of many a human heart, which, nevertheless, is compelled to hear the\r\nthrill and echo of the world’s gayety around it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore the conclusion of the Italian’s performance, a couple of men\r\nhappened to be passing, On their way to dinner. “I say, you young French\r\nfellow!” called out one of them,—“come away from that\r\ndoorstep, and go somewhere else with your nonsense! The Pyncheon family live\r\nthere; and they are in great trouble, just about this time. They don’t\r\nfeel musical to-day. It is reported all over town that Judge Pyncheon, who owns\r\nthe house, has been murdered; and the city marshal is going to look into the\r\nmatter. So be off with you, at once!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the Italian shouldered his hurdy-gurdy, he saw on the doorstep a card, which\r\nhad been covered, all the morning, by the newspaper that the carrier had flung\r\nupon it, but was now shuffled into sight. He picked it up, and perceiving\r\nsomething written in pencil, gave it to the man to read. In fact, it was an\r\nengraved card of Judge Pyncheon’s with certain pencilled memoranda on the\r\nback, referring to various businesses which it had been his purpose to transact\r\nduring the preceding day. It formed a prospective epitome of the day’s\r\nhistory; only that affairs had not turned out altogether in accordance with the\r\nprogramme. The card must have been lost from the Judge’s vest-pocket in\r\nhis preliminary attempt to gain access by the main entrance of the house.\r\nThough well soaked with rain, it was still partially legible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Look here; Dixey!” cried the man. “This has something to do\r\nwith Judge Pyncheon. See!—here’s his name printed on it; and here,\r\nI suppose, is some of his handwriting.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let’s go to the city marshal with it!” said Dixey. “It\r\nmay give him just the clew he wants. After all,” whispered he in his\r\ncompanion’s ear, “it would be no wonder if the Judge has gone into\r\nthat door and never come out again! A certain cousin of his may have been at\r\nhis old tricks. And Old Maid Pyncheon having got herself in debt by the\r\ncent-shop,—and the Judge’s pocket-book being well filled,—and\r\nbad blood amongst them already! Put all these things together and see what they\r\nmake!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hush, hush!” whispered the other. “It seems like a sin to be\r\nthe first to speak of such a thing. But I think, with you, that we had better\r\ngo to the city marshal.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, yes!” said Dixey. “Well!—I always said there was\r\nsomething devilish in that woman’s scowl!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe men wheeled about, accordingly, and retraced their steps up the street. The\r\nItalian, also, made the best of his way off, with a parting glance up at the\r\narched window. As for the children, they took to their heels, with one accord,\r\nand scampered as if some giant or ogre were in pursuit, until, at a good\r\ndistance from the house, they stopped as suddenly and simultaneously as they\r\nhad set out. Their susceptible nerves took an indefinite alarm from what they\r\nhad overheard. Looking back at the grotesque peaks and shadowy angles of the\r\nold mansion, they fancied a gloom diffused about it which no brightness of the\r\nsunshine could dispel. An imaginary Hepzibah scowled and shook her finger at\r\nthem, from several windows at the same moment. An imaginary Clifford—for\r\n(and it would have deeply wounded him to know it) he had always been a horror\r\nto these small people—stood behind the unreal Hepzibah, making awful\r\ngestures, in a faded dressing-gown. Children are even more apt, if possible,\r\nthan grown people, to catch the contagion of a panic terror. For the rest of\r\nthe day, the more timid went whole streets about, for the sake of avoiding the\r\nSeven Gables; while the bolder signalized their hardihood by challenging their\r\ncomrades to race past the mansion at full speed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt could not have been more than half an hour after the disappearance of the\r\nItalian boy, with his unseasonable melodies, when a cab drove down the street.\r\nIt stopped beneath the Pyncheon Elm; the cabman took a trunk, a canvas bag, and\r\na bandbox, from the top of his vehicle, and deposited them on the doorstep of\r\nthe old house; a straw bonnet, and then the pretty figure of a young girl, came\r\ninto view from the interior of the cab. It was Phœbe! Though not altogether so\r\nblooming as when she first tripped into our story,—for, in the few\r\nintervening weeks, her experiences had made her graver, more womanly, and\r\ndeeper-eyed, in token of a heart that had begun to suspect its\r\ndepths,—still there was the quiet glow of natural sunshine over her.\r\nNeither had she forfeited her proper gift of making things look real, rather\r\nthan fantastic, within her sphere. Yet we feel it to be a questionable venture,\r\neven for Phœbe, at this juncture, to cross the threshold of the Seven Gables.\r\nIs her healthful presence potent enough to chase away the crowd of pale,\r\nhideous, and sinful phantoms, that have gained admittance there since her\r\ndeparture? Or will she, likewise, fade, sicken, sadden, and grow into\r\ndeformity, and be only another pallid phantom, to glide noiselessly up and down\r\nthe stairs, and affright children as she pauses at the window?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt least, we would gladly forewarn the unsuspecting girl that there is nothing\r\nin human shape or substance to receive her, unless it be the figure of Judge\r\nPyncheon, who—wretched spectacle that he is, and frightful in our\r\nremembrance, since our night-long vigil with him!—still keeps his place\r\nin the oaken chair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe first tried the shop-door. It did not yield to her hand; and the white\r\ncurtain, drawn across the window which formed the upper section of the door,\r\nstruck her quick perceptive faculty as something unusual. Without making\r\nanother effort to enter here, she betook herself to the great portal, under the\r\narched window. Finding it fastened, she knocked. A reverberation came from the\r\nemptiness within. She knocked again, and a third time; and, listening intently,\r\nfancied that the floor creaked, as if Hepzibah were coming, with her ordinary\r\ntiptoe movement, to admit her. But so dead a silence ensued upon this imaginary\r\nsound, that she began to question whether she might not have mistaken the\r\nhouse, familiar as she thought herself with its exterior.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer notice was now attracted by a child’s voice, at some distance. It\r\nappeared to call her name. Looking in the direction whence it proceeded, Phœbe\r\nsaw little Ned Higgins, a good way down the street, stamping, shaking his head\r\nviolently, making deprecatory gestures with both hands, and shouting to her at\r\nmouth-wide screech.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no, Phœbe!” he screamed. “Don’t you go in!\r\nThere’s something wicked there!\r\nDon’t—don’t—don’t go in!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, as the little personage could not be induced to approach near enough to\r\nexplain himself, Phœbe concluded that he had been frightened, on some of his\r\nvisits to the shop, by her cousin Hepzibah; for the good lady’s\r\nmanifestations, in truth, ran about an equal chance of scaring children out of\r\ntheir wits, or compelling them to unseemly laughter. Still, she felt the more,\r\nfor this incident, how unaccountably silent and impenetrable the house had\r\nbecome. As her next resort, Phœbe made her way into the garden, where on so\r\nwarm and bright a day as the present, she had little doubt of finding Clifford,\r\nand perhaps Hepzibah also, idling away the noontide in the shadow of the arbor.\r\nImmediately on her entering the garden gate, the family of hens half ran, half\r\nflew to meet her; while a strange grimalkin, which was prowling under the\r\nparlor window, took to his heels, clambered hastily over the fence, and\r\nvanished. The arbor was vacant, and its floor, table, and circular bench were\r\nstill damp, and bestrewn with twigs and the disarray of the past storm. The\r\ngrowth of the garden seemed to have got quite out of bounds; the weeds had\r\ntaken advantage of Phœbe’s absence, and the long-continued rain, to run\r\nrampant over the flowers and kitchen-vegetables. Maule’s well had\r\noverflowed its stone border, and made a pool of formidable breadth in that\r\ncorner of the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe impression of the whole scene was that of a spot where no human foot had\r\nleft its print for many preceding days,—probably not since Phœbe’s\r\ndeparture,—for she saw a side-comb of her own under the table of the\r\narbor, where it must have fallen on the last afternoon when she and Clifford\r\nsat there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl knew that her two relatives were capable of far greater oddities than\r\nthat of shutting themselves up in their old house, as they appeared now to have\r\ndone. Nevertheless, with indistinct misgivings of something amiss, and\r\napprehensions to which she could not give shape, she approached the door that\r\nformed the customary communication between the house and garden. It was secured\r\nwithin, like the two which she had already tried. She knocked, however; and\r\nimmediately, as if the application had been expected, the door was drawn open,\r\nby a considerable exertion of some unseen person’s strength, not wide,\r\nbut far enough to afford her a sidelong entrance. As Hepzibah, in order not to\r\nexpose herself to inspection from without, invariably opened a door in this\r\nmanner, Phœbe necessarily concluded that it was her cousin who now admitted\r\nher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWithout hesitation, therefore, she stepped across the threshold, and had no\r\nsooner entered than the door closed behind her.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap20\"></a>XX.<br>\r\nThe Flower of Eden</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPhœbe, coming so suddenly from the sunny daylight, was altogether bedimmed in\r\nsuch density of shadow as lurked in most of the passages of the old house. She\r\nwas not at first aware by whom she had been admitted. Before her eyes had\r\nadapted themselves to the obscurity, a hand grasped her own with a firm but\r\ngentle and warm pressure, thus imparting a welcome which caused her heart to\r\nleap and thrill with an indefinable shiver of enjoyment. She felt herself drawn\r\nalong, not towards the parlor, but into a large and unoccupied apartment, which\r\nhad formerly been the grand reception-room of the Seven Gables. The sunshine\r\ncame freely into all the uncurtained windows of this room, and fell upon the\r\ndusty floor; so that Phœbe now clearly saw—what, indeed, had been no\r\nsecret, after the encounter of a warm hand with hers—that it was not\r\nHepzibah nor Clifford, but Holgrave, to whom she owed her reception. The\r\nsubtile, intuitive communication, or, rather, the vague and formless impression\r\nof something to be told, had made her yield unresistingly to his impulse.\r\nWithout taking away her hand, she looked eagerly in his face, not quick to\r\nforebode evil, but unavoidably conscious that the state of the family had\r\nchanged since her departure, and therefore anxious for an explanation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe artist looked paler than ordinary; there was a thoughtful and severe\r\ncontraction of his forehead, tracing a deep, vertical line between the\r\neyebrows. His smile, however, was full of genuine warmth, and had in it a joy,\r\nby far the most vivid expression that Phœbe had ever witnessed, shining out of\r\nthe New England reserve with which Holgrave habitually masked whatever lay near\r\nhis heart. It was the look wherewith a man, brooding alone over some fearful\r\nobject, in a dreary forest or illimitable desert, would recognize the familiar\r\naspect of his dearest friend, bringing up all the peaceful ideas that belong to\r\nhome, and the gentle current of every-day affairs. And yet, as he felt the\r\nnecessity of responding to her look of inquiry, the smile disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I ought not to rejoice that you have come, Phœbe,” said he.\r\n“We meet at a strange moment!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What has happened!” she exclaimed. “Why is the house so\r\ndeserted? Where are Hepzibah and Clifford?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Gone! I cannot imagine where they are!” answered Holgrave.\r\n“We are alone in the house!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hepzibah and Clifford gone?” cried Phœbe. “It is not\r\npossible! And why have you brought me into this room, instead of the parlor?\r\nAh, something terrible has happened! I must run and see!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no, Phœbe!” said Holgrave holding her back. “It is as I\r\nhave told you. They are gone, and I know not whither. A terrible event has,\r\nindeed happened, but not to them, nor, as I undoubtingly believe, through any\r\nagency of theirs. If I read your character rightly, Phœbe,” he\r\ncontinued, fixing his eyes on hers with stern anxiety, intermixed with\r\ntenderness, “gentle as you are, and seeming to have your sphere among\r\ncommon things, you yet possess remarkable strength. You have wonderful poise,\r\nand a faculty which, when tested, will prove itself capable of dealing with\r\nmatters that fall far out of the ordinary rule.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, no, I am very weak!” replied Phœbe, trembling. “But\r\ntell me what has happened!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are strong!” persisted Holgrave. “You must be both\r\nstrong and wise; for I am all astray, and need your counsel. It may be you can\r\nsuggest the one right thing to do!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tell me!—tell me!” said Phœbe, all in a tremble. “It\r\noppresses,—it terrifies me,—this mystery! Anything else I can\r\nbear!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe artist hesitated. Notwithstanding what he had just said, and most\r\nsincerely, in regard to the self-balancing power with which Phœbe impressed\r\nhim, it still seemed almost wicked to bring the awful secret of yesterday to\r\nher knowledge. It was like dragging a hideous shape of death into the cleanly\r\nand cheerful space before a household fire, where it would present all the\r\nuglier aspect, amid the decorousness of everything about it. Yet it could not\r\nbe concealed from her; she must needs know it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Phœbe,” said he, “do you remember this?” He put into\r\nher hand a daguerreotype; the same that he had shown her at their first\r\ninterview in the garden, and which so strikingly brought out the hard and\r\nrelentless traits of the original.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What has this to do with Hepzibah and Clifford?” asked Phœbe,\r\nwith impatient surprise that Holgrave should so trifle with her at such a\r\nmoment. “It is Judge Pyncheon! You have shown it to me before!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But here is the same face, taken within this half-hour” said the\r\nartist, presenting her with another miniature. “I had just finished it\r\nwhen I heard you at the door.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is death!” shuddered Phœbe, turning very pale. “Judge\r\nPyncheon dead!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Such as there represented,” said Holgrave, “he sits in the\r\nnext room. The Judge is dead, and Clifford and Hepzibah have vanished! I know\r\nno more. All beyond is conjecture. On returning to my solitary chamber, last\r\nevening, I noticed no light, either in the parlor, or Hepzibah’s room, or\r\nClifford’s; no stir nor footstep about the house. This morning, there was\r\nthe same death-like quiet. From my window, I overheard the testimony of a\r\nneighbor, that your relatives were seen leaving the house in the midst of\r\nyesterday’s storm. A rumor reached me, too, of Judge Pyncheon being\r\nmissed. A feeling which I cannot describe—an indefinite sense of some\r\ncatastrophe, or consummation—impelled me to make my way into this part of\r\nthe house, where I discovered what you see. As a point of evidence that may be\r\nuseful to Clifford, and also as a memorial valuable to myself,—for,\r\nPhœbe, there are hereditary reasons that connect me strangely with that\r\nman’s fate,—I used the means at my disposal to preserve this\r\npictorial record of Judge Pyncheon’s death.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven in her agitation, Phœbe could not help remarking the calmness of\r\nHolgrave’s demeanor. He appeared, it is true, to feel the whole awfulness\r\nof the Judge’s death, yet had received the fact into his mind without any\r\nmixture of surprise, but as an event preordained, happening inevitably, and so\r\nfitting itself into past occurrences that it could almost have been prophesied.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why have you not thrown open the doors, and called in witnesses?”\r\ninquired she with a painful shudder. “It is terrible to be here\r\nalone!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But Clifford!” suggested the artist. “Clifford and Hepzibah!\r\nWe must consider what is best to be done in their behalf. It is a wretched\r\nfatality that they should have disappeared! Their flight will throw the worst\r\ncoloring over this event of which it is susceptible. Yet how easy is the\r\nexplanation, to those who know them! Bewildered and terror-stricken by the\r\nsimilarity of this death to a former one, which was attended with such\r\ndisastrous consequences to Clifford, they have had no idea but of removing\r\nthemselves from the scene. How miserably unfortunate! Had Hepzibah but shrieked\r\naloud,—had Clifford flung wide the door, and proclaimed Judge\r\nPyncheon’s death,—it would have been, however awful in itself, an\r\nevent fruitful of good consequences to them. As I view it, it would have gone\r\nfar towards obliterating the black stain on Clifford’s character.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And how,” asked Phœbe, “could any good come from what is so\r\nvery dreadful?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because,” said the artist, “if the matter can be fairly\r\nconsidered and candidly interpreted, it must be evident that Judge Pyncheon\r\ncould not have come unfairly to his end. This mode of death had been an\r\nidiosyncrasy with his family, for generations past; not often occurring,\r\nindeed, but, when it does occur, usually attacking individuals about the\r\nJudge’s time of life, and generally in the tension of some mental crisis,\r\nor, perhaps, in an access of wrath. Old Maule’s prophecy was probably\r\nfounded on a knowledge of this physical predisposition in the Pyncheon race.\r\nNow, there is a minute and almost exact similarity in the appearances connected\r\nwith the death that occurred yesterday and those recorded of the death of\r\nClifford’s uncle thirty years ago. It is true, there was a certain\r\narrangement of circumstances, unnecessary to be recounted, which made it\r\npossible nay, as men look at these things, probable, or even certain—that\r\nold Jaffrey Pyncheon came to a violent death, and by Clifford’s\r\nhands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Whence came those circumstances?” exclaimed Phœbe. “He\r\nbeing innocent, as we know him to be!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They were arranged,” said Holgrave,—“at least such has\r\nlong been my conviction,—they were arranged after the uncle’s\r\ndeath, and before it was made public, by the man who sits in yonder parlor. His\r\nown death, so like that former one, yet attended by none of those suspicious\r\ncircumstances, seems the stroke of God upon him, at once a punishment for his\r\nwickedness, and making plain the innocence of Clifford. But this\r\nflight,—it distorts everything! He may be in concealment, near at hand.\r\nCould we but bring him back before the discovery of the Judge’s death,\r\nthe evil might be rectified.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We must not hide this thing a moment longer!” said Phœbe.\r\n“It is dreadful to keep it so closely in our hearts. Clifford is\r\ninnocent. God will make it manifest! Let us throw open the doors, and call all\r\nthe neighborhood to see the truth!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are right, Phœbe,” rejoined Holgrave. “Doubtless you\r\nare right.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet the artist did not feel the horror, which was proper to Phœbe’s\r\nsweet and order-loving character, at thus finding herself at issue with\r\nsociety, and brought in contact with an event that transcended ordinary rules.\r\nNeither was he in haste, like her, to betake himself within the precincts of\r\ncommon life. On the contrary, he gathered a wild enjoyment,—as it were, a\r\nflower of strange beauty, growing in a desolate spot, and blossoming in the\r\nwind,—such a flower of momentary happiness he gathered from his present\r\nposition. It separated Phœbe and himself from the world, and bound them to\r\neach other, by their exclusive knowledge of Judge Pyncheon’s mysterious\r\ndeath, and the counsel which they were forced to hold respecting it. The\r\nsecret, so long as it should continue such, kept them within the circle of a\r\nspell, a solitude in the midst of men, a remoteness as entire as that of an\r\nisland in mid-ocean; once divulged, the ocean would flow betwixt them, standing\r\non its widely sundered shores. Meanwhile, all the circumstances of their\r\nsituation seemed to draw them together; they were like two children who go hand\r\nin hand, pressing closely to one another’s side, through a shadow-haunted\r\npassage. The image of awful Death, which filled the house, held them united by\r\nhis stiffened grasp.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese influences hastened the development of emotions that might not otherwise\r\nhave flowered so. Possibly, indeed, it had been Holgrave’s purpose to let\r\nthem die in their undeveloped germs. “Why do we delay so?” asked\r\nPhœbe. “This secret takes away my breath! Let us throw open the\r\ndoors!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In all our lives there can never come another moment like this!”\r\nsaid Holgrave. “Phœbe, is it all terror?—nothing but terror? Are\r\nyou conscious of no joy, as I am, that has made this the only point of life\r\nworth living for?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It seems a sin,” replied Phœbe, trembling, “to think of joy\r\nat such a time!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Could you but know, Phœbe, how it was with me the hour before you\r\ncame!” exclaimed the artist. “A dark, cold, miserable hour! The\r\npresence of yonder dead man threw a great black shadow over everything; he made\r\nthe universe, so far as my perception could reach, a scene of guilt and of\r\nretribution more dreadful than the guilt. The sense of it took away my youth. I\r\nnever hoped to feel young again! The world looked strange, wild, evil, hostile;\r\nmy past life, so lonesome and dreary; my future, a shapeless gloom, which I\r\nmust mould into gloomy shapes! But, Phœbe, you crossed the threshold; and\r\nhope, warmth, and joy came in with you! The black moment became at once a\r\nblissful one. It must not pass without the spoken word. I love you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How can you love a simple girl like me?” asked Phœbe, compelled\r\nby his earnestness to speak. “You have many, many thoughts, with which I\r\nshould try in vain to sympathize. And I,—I, too,—I have tendencies\r\nwith which you would sympathize as little. That is less matter. But I have not\r\nscope enough to make you happy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are my only possibility of happiness!” answered Holgrave.\r\n“I have no faith in it, except as you bestow it on me!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And then—I am afraid!” continued Phœbe, shrinking towards\r\nHolgrave, even while she told him so frankly the doubts with which he affected\r\nher. “You will lead me out of my own quiet path. You will make me strive\r\nto follow you where it is pathless. I cannot do so. It is not my nature. I\r\nshall sink down and perish!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Phœbe!” exclaimed Holgrave, with almost a sigh, and a smile\r\nthat was burdened with thought.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It will be far otherwise than as you forebode. The world owes all its\r\nonward impulses to men ill at ease. The happy man inevitably confines himself\r\nwithin ancient limits. I have a presentiment that, hereafter, it will be my lot\r\nto set out trees, to make fences,—perhaps, even, in due time, to build a\r\nhouse for another generation,—in a word, to conform myself to laws and\r\nthe peaceful practice of society. Your poise will be more powerful than any\r\noscillating tendency of mine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I would not have it so!” said Phœbe earnestly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you love me?” asked Holgrave. “If we love one another,\r\nthe moment has room for nothing more. Let us pause upon it, and be satisfied.\r\nDo you love me, Phœbe?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You look into my heart,” said she, letting her eyes drop.\r\n“You know I love you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd it was in this hour, so full of doubt and awe, that the one miracle was\r\nwrought, without which every human existence is a blank. The bliss which makes\r\nall things true, beautiful, and holy shone around this youth and maiden. They\r\nwere conscious of nothing sad nor old. They transfigured the earth, and made it\r\nEden again, and themselves the two first dwellers in it. The dead man, so close\r\nbeside them, was forgotten. At such a crisis, there is no death; for\r\nimmortality is revealed anew, and embraces everything in its hallowed\r\natmosphere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut how soon the heavy earth-dream settled down again!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hark!” whispered Phœbe. “Somebody is at the street\r\ndoor!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now let us meet the world!” said Holgrave. “No doubt, the\r\nrumor of Judge Pyncheon’s visit to this house, and the flight of Hepzibah\r\nand Clifford, is about to lead to the investigation of the premises. We have no\r\nway but to meet it. Let us open the door at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, to their surprise, before they could reach the street door,—even\r\nbefore they quitted the room in which the foregoing interview had\r\npassed,—they heard footsteps in the farther passage. The door, therefore,\r\nwhich they supposed to be securely locked,—which Holgrave, indeed, had\r\nseen to be so, and at which Phœbe had vainly tried to enter,—must have\r\nbeen opened from without. The sound of footsteps was not harsh, bold, decided,\r\nand intrusive, as the gait of strangers would naturally be, making\r\nauthoritative entrance into a dwelling where they knew themselves unwelcome. It\r\nwas feeble, as of persons either weak or weary; there was the mingled murmur of\r\ntwo voices, familiar to both the listeners.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can it be?” whispered Holgrave.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is they!” answered Phœbe. “Thank God!—thank\r\nGod!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then, as if in sympathy with Phœbe’s whispered ejaculation, they\r\nheard Hepzibah’s voice more distinctly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thank God, my brother, we are at home!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well!—Yes!—thank God!” responded Clifford. “A\r\ndreary home, Hepzibah! But you have done well to bring me hither! Stay! That\r\nparlor door is open. I cannot pass by it! Let me go and rest me in the arbor,\r\nwhere I used,—oh, very long ago, it seems to me, after what has befallen\r\nus,—where I used to be so happy with little Phœbe!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the house was not altogether so dreary as Clifford imagined it. They had\r\nnot made many steps,—in truth, they were lingering in the entry, with the\r\nlistlessness of an accomplished purpose, uncertain what to do next,—when\r\nPhœbe ran to meet them. On beholding her, Hepzibah burst into tears. With all\r\nher might, she had staggered onward beneath the burden of grief and\r\nresponsibility, until now that it was safe to fling it down. Indeed, she had\r\nnot energy to fling it down, but had ceased to uphold it, and suffered it to\r\npress her to the earth. Clifford appeared the stronger of the two.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is our own little Phœbe!—Ah! and Holgrave with, her”\r\nexclaimed he, with a glance of keen and delicate insight, and a smile,\r\nbeautiful, kind, but melancholy. “I thought of you both, as we came down\r\nthe street, and beheld Alice’s Posies in full bloom. And so the flower of\r\nEden has bloomed, likewise, in this old, darksome house to-day.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap21\"></a>XXI.<br>\r\nThe Departure</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe sudden death of so prominent a member of the social world as the Honorable\r\nJudge Jaffrey Pyncheon created a sensation (at least, in the circles more\r\nimmediately connected with the deceased) which had hardly quite subsided in a\r\nfortnight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt may be remarked, however, that, of all the events which constitute a\r\nperson’s biography, there is scarcely one—none, certainly, of\r\nanything like a similar importance—to which the world so easily\r\nreconciles itself as to his death. In most other cases and contingencies, the\r\nindividual is present among us, mixed up with the daily revolution of affairs,\r\nand affording a definite point for observation. At his decease, there is only a\r\nvacancy, and a momentary eddy,—very small, as compared with the apparent\r\nmagnitude of the ingurgitated object,—and a bubble or two, ascending out\r\nof the black depth and bursting at the surface. As regarded Judge Pyncheon, it\r\nseemed probable, at first blush, that the mode of his final departure might\r\ngive him a larger and longer posthumous vogue than ordinarily attends the\r\nmemory of a distinguished man. But when it came to be understood, on the\r\nhighest professional authority, that the event was a natural, and—except\r\nfor some unimportant particulars, denoting a slight idiosyncrasy—by no\r\nmeans an unusual form of death, the public, with its customary alacrity,\r\nproceeded to forget that he had ever lived. In short, the honorable Judge was\r\nbeginning to be a stale subject before half the country newspapers had found\r\ntime to put their columns in mourning, and publish his exceedingly eulogistic\r\nobituary.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNevertheless, creeping darkly through the places which this excellent person\r\nhad haunted in his lifetime, there was a hidden stream of private talk, such as\r\nit would have shocked all decency to speak loudly at the street-corners. It is\r\nvery singular, how the fact of a man’s death often seems to give people a\r\ntruer idea of his character, whether for good or evil, than they have ever\r\npossessed while he was living and acting among them. Death is so genuine a fact\r\nthat it excludes falsehood, or betrays its emptiness; it is a touchstone that\r\nproves the gold, and dishonors the baser metal. Could the departed, whoever he\r\nmay be, return in a week after his decease, he would almost invariably find\r\nhimself at a higher or lower point than he had formerly occupied, on the scale\r\nof public appreciation. But the talk, or scandal, to which we now allude, had\r\nreference to matters of no less old a date than the supposed murder, thirty or\r\nforty years ago, of the late Judge Pyncheon’s uncle. The medical opinion\r\nwith regard to his own recent and regretted decease had almost entirely\r\nobviated the idea that a murder was committed in the former case. Yet, as the\r\nrecord showed, there were circumstances irrefragably indicating that some\r\nperson had gained access to old Jaffrey Pyncheon’s private apartments, at\r\nor near the moment of his death. His desk and private drawers, in a room\r\ncontiguous to his bedchamber, had been ransacked; money and valuable articles\r\nwere missing; there was a bloody hand-print on the old man’s linen; and,\r\nby a powerfully welded chain of deductive evidence, the guilt of the robbery\r\nand apparent murder had been fixed on Clifford, then residing with his uncle in\r\nthe House of the Seven Gables.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhencesoever originating, there now arose a theory that undertook so to account\r\nfor these circumstances as to exclude the idea of Clifford’s agency. Many\r\npersons affirmed that the history and elucidation of the facts, long so\r\nmysterious, had been obtained by the daguerreotypist from one of those\r\nmesmerical seers who, nowadays, so strangely perplex the aspect of human\r\naffairs, and put everybody’s natural vision to the blush, by the marvels\r\nwhich they see with their eyes shut.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to this version of the story, Judge Pyncheon, exemplary as we have\r\nportrayed him in our narrative, was, in his youth, an apparently irreclaimable\r\nscapegrace. The brutish, the animal instincts, as is often the case, had been\r\ndeveloped earlier than the intellectual qualities, and the force of character,\r\nfor which he was afterwards remarkable. He had shown himself wild, dissipated,\r\naddicted to low pleasures, little short of ruffianly in his propensities, and\r\nrecklessly expensive, with no other resources than the bounty of his uncle.\r\nThis course of conduct had alienated the old bachelor’s affection, once\r\nstrongly fixed upon him. Now it is averred,—but whether on authority\r\navailable in a court of justice, we do not pretend to have\r\ninvestigated,—that the young man was tempted by the devil, one night, to\r\nsearch his uncle’s private drawers, to which he had unsuspected means of\r\naccess. While thus criminally occupied, he was startled by the opening of the\r\nchamber-door. There stood old Jaffrey Pyncheon, in his nightclothes! The\r\nsurprise of such a discovery, his agitation, alarm, and horror, brought on the\r\ncrisis of a disorder to which the old bachelor had an hereditary liability; he\r\nseemed to choke with blood, and fell upon the floor, striking his temple a\r\nheavy blow against the corner of a table. What was to be done? The old man was\r\nsurely dead! Assistance would come too late! What a misfortune, indeed, should\r\nit come too soon, since his reviving consciousness would bring the recollection\r\nof the ignominious offence which he had beheld his nephew in the very act of\r\ncommitting!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he never did revive. With the cool hardihood that always pertained to him,\r\nthe young man continued his search of the drawers, and found a will, of recent\r\ndate, in favor of Clifford,—which he destroyed,—and an older one,\r\nin his own favor, which he suffered to remain. But before retiring, Jaffrey\r\nbethought himself of the evidence, in these ransacked drawers, that some one\r\nhad visited the chamber with sinister purposes. Suspicion, unless averted,\r\nmight fix upon the real offender. In the very presence of the dead man,\r\ntherefore, he laid a scheme that should free himself at the expense of\r\nClifford, his rival, for whose character he had at once a contempt and a\r\nrepugnance. It is not probable, be it said, that he acted with any set purpose\r\nof involving Clifford in a charge of murder. Knowing that his uncle did not die\r\nby violence, it may not have occurred to him, in the hurry of the crisis, that\r\nsuch an inference might be drawn. But, when the affair took this darker aspect,\r\nJaffrey’s previous steps had already pledged him to those which remained.\r\nSo craftily had he arranged the circumstances, that, at Clifford’s trial,\r\nhis cousin hardly found it necessary to swear to anything false, but only to\r\nwithhold the one decisive explanation, by refraining to state what he had\r\nhimself done and witnessed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus Jaffrey Pyncheon’s inward criminality, as regarded Clifford, was,\r\nindeed, black and damnable; while its mere outward show and positive commission\r\nwas the smallest that could possibly consist with so great a sin. This is just\r\nthe sort of guilt that a man of eminent respectability finds it easiest to\r\ndispose of. It was suffered to fade out of sight or be reckoned a venial\r\nmatter, in the Honorable Judge Pyncheon’s long subsequent survey of his\r\nown life. He shuffled it aside, among the forgotten and forgiven frailties of\r\nhis youth, and seldom thought of it again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe leave the Judge to his repose. He could not be styled fortunate at the hour\r\nof death. Unknowingly, he was a childless man, while striving to add more\r\nwealth to his only child’s inheritance. Hardly a week after his decease,\r\none of the Cunard steamers brought intelligence of the death, by cholera, of\r\nJudge Pyncheon’s son, just at the point of embarkation for his native\r\nland. By this misfortune Clifford became rich; so did Hepzibah; so did our\r\nlittle village maiden, and, through her, that sworn foe of wealth and all\r\nmanner of conservatism,—the wild reformer,—Holgrave!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was now far too late in Clifford’s life for the good opinion of\r\nsociety to be worth the trouble and anguish of a formal vindication. What he\r\nneeded was the love of a very few; not the admiration, or even the respect, of\r\nthe unknown many. The latter might probably have been won for him, had those on\r\nwhom the guardianship of his welfare had fallen deemed it advisable to expose\r\nClifford to a miserable resuscitation of past ideas, when the condition of\r\nwhatever comfort he might expect lay in the calm of forgetfulness. After such\r\nwrong as he had suffered, there is no reparation. The pitiable mockery of it,\r\nwhich the world might have been ready enough to offer, coming so long after the\r\nagony had done its utmost work, would have been fit only to provoke bitterer\r\nlaughter than poor Clifford was ever capable of. It is a truth (and it would be\r\na very sad one but for the higher hopes which it suggests) that no great\r\nmistake, whether acted or endured, in our mortal sphere, is ever really set\r\nright. Time, the continual vicissitude of circumstances, and the invariable\r\ninopportunity of death, render it impossible. If, after long lapse of years,\r\nthe right seems to be in our power, we find no niche to set it in. The better\r\nremedy is for the sufferer to pass on, and leave what he once thought his\r\nirreparable ruin far behind him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe shock of Judge Pyncheon’s death had a permanently invigorating and\r\nultimately beneficial effect on Clifford. That strong and ponderous man had\r\nbeen Clifford’s nightmare. There was no free breath to be drawn, within\r\nthe sphere of so malevolent an influence. The first effect of freedom, as we\r\nhave witnessed in Clifford’s aimless flight, was a tremulous\r\nexhilaration. Subsiding from it, he did not sink into his former intellectual\r\napathy. He never, it is true, attained to nearly the full measure of what might\r\nhave been his faculties. But he recovered enough of them partially to light up\r\nhis character, to display some outline of the marvellous grace that was\r\nabortive in it, and to make him the object of no less deep, although less\r\nmelancholy interest than heretofore. He was evidently happy. Could we pause to\r\ngive another picture of his daily life, with all the appliances now at command\r\nto gratify his instinct for the Beautiful, the garden scenes, that seemed so\r\nsweet to him, would look mean and trivial in comparison.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nVery soon after their change of fortune, Clifford, Hepzibah, and little Phœbe,\r\nwith the approval of the artist, concluded to remove from the dismal old House\r\nof the Seven Gables, and take up their abode, for the present, at the elegant\r\ncountry-seat of the late Judge Pyncheon. Chanticleer and his family had already\r\nbeen transported thither, where the two hens had forthwith begun an\r\nindefatigable process of egg-laying, with an evident design, as a matter of\r\nduty and conscience, to continue their illustrious breed under better auspices\r\nthan for a century past. On the day set for their departure, the principal\r\npersonages of our story, including good Uncle Venner, were assembled in the\r\nparlor.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The country-house is certainly a very fine one, so far as the plan\r\ngoes,” observed Holgrave, as the party were discussing their future\r\narrangements. “But I wonder that the late Judge—being so opulent,\r\nand with a reasonable prospect of transmitting his wealth to descendants of his\r\nown—should not have felt the propriety of embodying so excellent a piece\r\nof domestic architecture in stone, rather than in wood. Then, every generation\r\nof the family might have altered the interior, to suit its own taste and\r\nconvenience; while the exterior, through the lapse of years, might have been\r\nadding venerableness to its original beauty, and thus giving that impression of\r\npermanence which I consider essential to the happiness of any one\r\nmoment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why,” cried Phœbe, gazing into the artist’s face with\r\ninfinite amazement, “how wonderfully your ideas are changed! A house of\r\nstone, indeed! It is but two or three weeks ago that you seemed to wish people\r\nto live in something as fragile and temporary as a bird’s-nest!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Phœbe, I told you how it would be!” said the artist, with a\r\nhalf-melancholy laugh. “You find me a conservative already! Little did I\r\nthink ever to become one. It is especially unpardonable in this dwelling of so\r\nmuch hereditary misfortune, and under the eye of yonder portrait of a model\r\nconservative, who, in that very character, rendered himself so long the evil\r\ndestiny of his race.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That picture!” said Clifford, seeming to shrink from its stern\r\nglance. “Whenever I look at it, there is an old dreamy recollection\r\nhaunting me, but keeping just beyond the grasp of my mind. Wealth, it seems to\r\nsay!—boundless wealth!—unimaginable wealth! I could fancy that,\r\nwhen I was a child, or a youth, that portrait had spoken, and told me a rich\r\nsecret, or had held forth its hand, with the written record of hidden opulence.\r\nBut those old matters are so dim with me, nowadays! What could this dream have\r\nbeen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Perhaps I can recall it,” answered Holgrave. “See! There are\r\na hundred chances to one that no person, unacquainted with the secret, would\r\never touch this spring.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A secret spring!” cried Clifford. “Ah, I remember now! I did\r\ndiscover it, one summer afternoon, when I was idling and dreaming about the\r\nhouse, long, long ago. But the mystery escapes me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe artist put his finger on the contrivance to which he had referred. In\r\nformer days, the effect would probably have been to cause the picture to start\r\nforward. But, in so long a period of concealment, the machinery had been eaten\r\nthrough with rust; so that at Holgrave’s pressure, the portrait, frame\r\nand all, tumbled suddenly from its position, and lay face downward on the\r\nfloor. A recess in the wall was thus brought to light, in which lay an object\r\nso covered with a century’s dust that it could not immediately be\r\nrecognized as a folded sheet of parchment. Holgrave opened it, and displayed an\r\nancient deed, signed with the hieroglyphics of several Indian sagamores, and\r\nconveying to Colonel Pyncheon and his heirs, forever, a vast extent of\r\nterritory at the Eastward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is the very parchment, the attempt to recover which cost the\r\nbeautiful Alice Pyncheon her happiness and life,” said the artist,\r\nalluding to his legend. “It is what the Pyncheons sought in vain, while\r\nit was valuable; and now that they find the treasure, it has long been\r\nworthless.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Poor Cousin Jaffrey! This is what deceived him,” exclaimed\r\nHepzibah. “When they were young together, Clifford probably made a kind\r\nof fairy-tale of this discovery. He was always dreaming hither and thither\r\nabout the house, and lighting up its dark corners with beautiful stories. And\r\npoor Jaffrey, who took hold of everything as if it were real, thought my\r\nbrother had found out his uncle’s wealth. He died with this delusion in\r\nhis mind!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But,” said Phœbe, apart to Holgrave, “how came you to know\r\nthe secret?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dearest Phœbe,” said Holgrave, “how will it please you\r\nto assume the name of Maule? As for the secret, it is the only inheritance that\r\nhas come down to me from my ancestors. You should have known sooner (only that\r\nI was afraid of frightening you away) that, in this long drama of wrong and\r\nretribution, I represent the old wizard, and am probably as much a wizard as\r\never he was. The son of the executed Matthew Maule, while building this house,\r\ntook the opportunity to construct that recess, and hide away the Indian deed,\r\non which depended the immense land-claim of the Pyncheons. Thus they bartered\r\ntheir eastern territory for Maule’s garden-ground.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And now” said Uncle Venner “I suppose their whole claim is\r\nnot worth one man’s share in my farm yonder!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Uncle Venner,” cried Phœbe, taking the patched\r\nphilosopher’s hand, “you must never talk any more about your farm!\r\nYou shall never go there, as long as you live! There is a cottage in our new\r\ngarden,—the prettiest little yellowish-brown cottage you ever saw; and\r\nthe sweetest-looking place, for it looks just as if it were made of\r\ngingerbread,—and we are going to fit it up and furnish it, on purpose for\r\nyou. And you shall do nothing but what you choose, and shall be as happy as the\r\nday is long, and shall keep Cousin Clifford in spirits with the wisdom and\r\npleasantness which is always dropping from your lips!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! my dear child,” quoth good Uncle Venner, quite overcome,\r\n“if you were to speak to a young man as you do to an old one, his chance\r\nof keeping his heart another minute would not be worth one of the buttons on my\r\nwaistcoat! And—soul alive!—that great sigh, which you made me\r\nheave, has burst off the very last of them! But, never mind! It was the\r\nhappiest sigh I ever did heave; and it seems as if I must have drawn in a gulp\r\nof heavenly breath, to make it with. Well, well, Miss Phœbe! They’ll\r\nmiss me in the gardens hereabouts, and round by the back doors; and Pyncheon\r\nStreet, I’m afraid, will hardly look the same without old Uncle Venner,\r\nwho remembers it with a mowing field on one side, and the garden of the Seven\r\nGables on the other. But either I must go to your country-seat, or you must\r\ncome to my farm,—that’s one of two things certain; and I leave you\r\nto choose which!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, come with us, by all means, Uncle Venner!” said Clifford, who\r\nhad a remarkable enjoyment of the old man’s mellow, quiet, and simple\r\nspirit. “I want you always to be within five minutes, saunter of my\r\nchair. You are the only philosopher I ever knew of whose wisdom has not a drop\r\nof bitter essence at the bottom!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear me!” cried Uncle Venner, beginning partly to realize what\r\nmanner of man he was. “And yet folks used to set me down among the simple\r\nones, in my younger days! But I suppose I am like a Roxbury russet,—a\r\ngreat deal the better, the longer I can be kept. Yes; and my words of wisdom,\r\nthat you and Phœbe tell me of, are like the golden dandelions, which never\r\ngrow in the hot months, but may be seen glistening among the withered grass,\r\nand under the dry leaves, sometimes as late as December. And you are welcome,\r\nfriends, to my mess of dandelions, if there were twice as many!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA plain, but handsome, dark-green barouche had now drawn up in front of the\r\nruinous portal of the old mansion-house. The party came forth, and (with the\r\nexception of good Uncle Venner, who was to follow in a few days) proceeded to\r\ntake their places. They were chatting and laughing very pleasantly together;\r\nand—as proves to be often the case, at moments when we ought to palpitate\r\nwith sensibility—Clifford and Hepzibah bade a final farewell to the abode\r\nof their forefathers, with hardly more emotion than if they had made it their\r\narrangement to return thither at tea-time. Several children were drawn to the\r\nspot by so unusual a spectacle as the barouche and pair of gray horses.\r\nRecognizing little Ned Higgins among them, Hepzibah put her hand into her\r\npocket, and presented the urchin, her earliest and staunchest customer, with\r\nsilver enough to people the Domdaniel cavern of his interior with as various a\r\nprocession of quadrupeds as passed into the ark.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTwo men were passing, just as the barouche drove off.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, Dixey,” said one of them, “what do you think of this?\r\nMy wife kept a cent-shop three months, and lost five dollars on her outlay. Old\r\nMaid Pyncheon has been in trade just about as long, and rides off in her\r\ncarriage with a couple of hundred thousand,—reckoning her share, and\r\nClifford’s, and Phœbe’s,—and some say twice as much! If you\r\nchoose to call it luck, it is all very well; but if we are to take it as the\r\nwill of Providence, why, I can’t exactly fathom it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pretty good business!” quoth the sagacious\r\nDixey,—“pretty good business!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMaule’s well, all this time, though left in solitude, was throwing up a\r\nsuccession of kaleidoscopic pictures, in which a gifted eye might have seen\r\nforeshadowed the coming fortunes of Hepzibah and Clifford, and the descendant\r\nof the legendary wizard, and the village maiden, over whom he had thrown\r\nlove’s web of sorcery. The Pyncheon Elm, moreover, with what foliage the\r\nSeptember gale had spared to it, whispered unintelligible prophecies. And wise\r\nUncle Venner, passing slowly from the ruinous porch, seemed to hear a strain of\r\nmusic, and fancied that sweet Alice Pyncheon—after witnessing these\r\ndeeds, this bygone woe and this present happiness, of her kindred\r\nmortals—had given one farewell touch of a spirit’s joy upon her\r\nharpsichord, as she floated heavenward from the H<small>OUSE OF THE</small>\r\nS<small>EVEN</small> G<small>ABLES</small>!\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES ***</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

I arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure\r\nmy dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success\r\nof my undertaking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\r\nPetersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\r\nbraces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this\r\nfeeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\r\nwhich I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\r\nInspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\r\nand vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\r\nfrost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\r\nregion of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\r\nvisible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\r\nperpetual splendour.  There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put\r\nsome trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished;\r\nand, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\r\nwonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable\r\nglobe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the\r\nphenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered\r\nsolitudes.  What may not be expected in a country of eternal light?  I\r\nmay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may\r\nregulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\r\nvoyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  I\r\nshall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world\r\nnever before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\r\nthe foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\r\nconquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\r\nlaborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\r\nboat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his\r\nnative river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you\r\ncannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\r\nmankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\r\nto those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\r\nrequisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at\r\nall possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\r\nletter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\r\nto heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\r\na steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\r\neye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\r\nhave read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\r\nbeen made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\r\nthrough the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a\r\nhistory of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\r\nwhole of our good Uncle Thomas’ library.  My education was neglected,\r\nyet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study\r\nday and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\r\nI had felt, as a child, on learning that my father’s dying injunction\r\nhad forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\r\nwhose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also\r\nbecame a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\r\nI imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\r\nnames of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well\r\nacquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\r\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\r\nthoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I\r\ncan, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\r\ngreat enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I\r\naccompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\r\nI voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\r\nworked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\r\nnights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\r\nbranches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\r\nthe greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an\r\nunder-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\r\nmust own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\r\ndignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\r\nearnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\r\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\r\nevery enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\r\nvoice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\r\nfirm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\r\nabout to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\r\nwill demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\r\nof others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly\r\nquickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\r\nmy opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The\r\ncold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs—a dress which I have\r\nalready adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\r\ndeck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\r\nprevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no\r\nambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\r\nArchangel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\r\nintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\r\ninsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\r\namong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\r\nsail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\r\ncan I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\r\nwill pass before you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon,\r\nor never.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFarewell, my dear, excellent Margaret. Heaven shower down blessings on you,\r\nand save me, that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your\r\nlove and kindness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nYour affectionate brother,<br>\r\nR. Walton\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"letter2\"></a>Letter 2</h2>\r\n<p class=\"letter2\">\r\n<i>To Mrs. Saville, England.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nArchangel, 28th March, 17—.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow!\r\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise.  I have hired a\r\nvessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have\r\nalready engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly\r\npossessed of dauntless courage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy, and the\r\nabsence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil, I have no\r\nfriend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\r\nwill be none to participate my joy; if I am assailed by disappointment, no\r\none will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. I shall commit my thoughts\r\nto paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of\r\nfeeling. I desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose\r\neyes would reply to mine. You may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but I\r\nbitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\r\ncourageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\r\ntastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\r\nfriend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\r\nand too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\r\nthat I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\r\non a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas’ books of voyages.\r\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\r\ncountry; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\r\nmost important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\r\nnecessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\r\ncountry. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\r\nschoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\r\ndaydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\r\ncall it) <i>keeping;</i> and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\r\nenough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to\r\nendeavour to regulate my mind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\r\nwide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\r\nsome feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\r\nrugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\r\nand enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\r\nmore characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\r\nEnglishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\r\nunsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\r\nhumanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\r\nfinding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\r\nin my enterprise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\r\nship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\r\ncircumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\r\nme very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\r\nspent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\r\ngroundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\r\nthe usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\r\nnecessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\r\nof heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\r\nmyself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\r\nof him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\r\nhappiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\r\na young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\r\nsum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\r\nhis mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\r\ntears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\r\nconfessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\r\nand that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\r\nreassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\r\ninstantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\r\nmoney, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\r\nbestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\r\nprize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\r\nwoman’s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\r\nman decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\r\nwhen he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\r\nuntil he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\r\ninclinations. “What a noble fellow!” you will exclaim. He is\r\nso; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\r\nof ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\r\nthe more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\r\notherwise he would command.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\r\nconceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\r\nwavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\r\nis only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The\r\nwinter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\r\nis considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\r\nsooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me\r\nsufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\r\nsafety of others is committed to my care.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\r\nundertaking.  It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\r\nthe trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\r\nI am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to “the\r\nland of mist and snow,” but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\r\nbe alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\r\nwoeful as the “Ancient Mariner.”  You will smile at my allusion, but I\r\nwill disclose a secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my\r\npassionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\r\nproduction of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something\r\nat work in my soul which I do not understand.  I am practically\r\nindustrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and\r\nlabour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief\r\nin the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out\r\nof the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited\r\nregions I am about to explore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut to return to dearer considerations.

I am, however, in good\r\nspirits:  my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the\r\nfloating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers\r\nof the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. We\r\nhave already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of\r\nsummer, and although not so warm as in England, the southern gales,\r\nwhich blow us speedily towards those shores which I so ardently desire\r\nto attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which I had not\r\nexpected.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a\r\nletter.

Our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we\r\nwere compassed round by a very thick fog.  We accordingly lay to,\r\nhoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout two o’clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out\r\nin every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to\r\nhave no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\r\ngrow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\r\nattracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\r\nsituation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\r\ndogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\r\nbeing which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\nsat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress\r\nof the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\r\ndistant inequalities of the ice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\r\nmany hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\r\nit was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\r\nice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\r\ngreatest attention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\r\nnight the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\r\nmorning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\r\nfloat about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\r\nrest for a few hours.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\r\nfound all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\r\ntalking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\r\nhad seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\r\nfragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\r\nbeing within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\r\nHe was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\r\nsome undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the\r\nmaster said, “Here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\r\non the open sea.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\r\nforeign accent.  “Before I come on board your vessel,” said he,\r\n“will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\r\nto me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\r\nsupposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\r\nhave exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I\r\nreplied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\r\nnorthern pole.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUpon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\r\nGood God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\r\nhis safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were\r\nnearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\r\nsuffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted\r\nto carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\r\nair he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\r\nrestored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\r\nswallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we\r\nwrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\r\nkitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\r\nwhich restored him wonderfully.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTwo days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\r\nfeared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he\r\nhad in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\r\nattended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more\r\ninteresting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\r\nwildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\r\nperforms an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\r\ntrifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\r\na beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he\r\nis generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\r\nteeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\r\nthe men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\r\nallow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\r\nand mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\r\nOnce, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\r\nin so strange a vehicle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\r\nhe replied, “To seek one who fled from me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\r\nsaw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis aroused the stranger’s attention, and he asked a multitude of\r\nquestions concerning the route which the dæmon, as he called him, had\r\npursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, “I have,\r\ndoubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\r\npeople; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\r\ntrouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\r\nbenevolently restored me to life.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSoon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\r\nice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer\r\nwith any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\r\nmidnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\r\nbefore that time; but of this I could not judge.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\r\nstranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\r\nthe sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\r\nthe cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\r\nI have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant\r\nnotice if any new object should appear in sight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the\r\npresent day.  The stranger has gradually improved in health but is very\r\nsilent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.\r\nYet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\r\ninterested in him, although they have had very little communication\r\nwith him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\r\nconstant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must\r\nhave been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\r\nso attractive and amiable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI said in one of my letters, my dear Margaret, that I should find no friend\r\non the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who, before his spirit had been\r\nbroken by misery, I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother\r\nof my heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,\r\nshould I have any fresh incidents to record.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nAugust 13th, 17—.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy affection for my guest increases every day.  He excites at once my\r\nadmiration and my pity to an astonishing degree.  How can I see so\r\nnoble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant\r\ngrief?  He is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and\r\nwhen he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,\r\nyet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,\r\napparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. Yet, although\r\nunhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he\r\ninterests himself deeply in the projects of others. He has frequently\r\nconversed with me on mine, which I have communicated to him without\r\ndisguise. He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my\r\neventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken\r\nto secure it. I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the\r\nlanguage of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul\r\nand to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly I would\r\nsacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my\r\nenterprise. One man’s life or death were but a small price to pay for\r\nthe acquirement of the knowledge which I sought, for the dominion I should\r\nacquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. As I spoke, a\r\ndark gloom spread over my listener’s countenance. At first I\r\nperceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before\r\nhis eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle\r\nfast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. I\r\npaused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: “Unhappy man! Do you\r\nshare my madness? Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? Hear me;\r\nlet me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the\r\nparoxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened\r\npowers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were\r\nnecessary to restore his composure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise\r\nhimself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of\r\ndespair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. He asked\r\nme the history of my earlier years. The tale was quickly told, but it\r\nawakened various trains of reflection. I spoke of my desire of finding a\r\nfriend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than\r\nhad ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could\r\nboast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I agree with you,” replied the stranger; “we are\r\nunfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than\r\nourselves—such a friend ought to be—do not lend his aid to\r\nperfectionate our weak and faulty natures. I once had a friend, the most\r\nnoble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting\r\nfriendship. You have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for\r\ndespair. But I—I have lost everything and cannot begin life\r\nanew.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled\r\ngrief that touched me to the heart.  But he was silent and presently\r\nretired to his cabin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he\r\ndoes the beauties of nature.  The starry sky, the sea, and every sight\r\nafforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of\r\nelevating his soul from earth.  Such a man has a double existence:  he\r\nmay suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he\r\nhas retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a\r\nhalo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWill you smile at the enthusiasm I express concerning this divine\r\nwanderer?  You would not if you saw him.  You have been tutored and\r\nrefined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore\r\nsomewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to\r\nappreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man.  Sometimes I\r\nhave endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that\r\nelevates him so immeasurably above any other person I ever knew.  I\r\nbelieve it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing\r\npower of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled\r\nfor clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a\r\nvoice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nAugust 19th, 17—.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYesterday the stranger said to me, “You may easily perceive, Captain\r\nWalton, that I have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes.  I had\r\ndetermined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with\r\nme, but you have won me to alter my determination.  You seek for\r\nknowledge and wisdom, as I once did; and I ardently hope that the\r\ngratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine\r\nhas been.  I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be\r\nuseful to you; yet, when I reflect that you are pursuing the same\r\ncourse, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me\r\nwhat I am, I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one\r\nthat may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you\r\nin case of failure.  Prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually\r\ndeemed marvellous.  Were we among the tamer scenes of nature I might\r\nfear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things\r\nwill appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would\r\nprovoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers\r\nof nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys in its series\r\ninternal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou may easily imagine that I was much gratified by the offered\r\ncommunication, yet I could not endure that he should renew his grief by\r\na recital of his misfortunes.  I felt the greatest eagerness to hear\r\nthe promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong\r\ndesire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power.  I expressed\r\nthese feelings in my answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I thank you,” he replied, “for your sympathy, but it is\r\nuseless; my fate is nearly fulfilled.  I wait but for one event, and then I\r\nshall repose in peace.  I understand your feeling,” continued he,\r\nperceiving that I wished to interrupt him; “but you are mistaken, my\r\nfriend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my\r\ndestiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is\r\ndetermined.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when I\r\nshould be at leisure. This promise drew from me the warmest thanks. I have\r\nresolved every night, when I am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to\r\nrecord, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during\r\nthe day. If I should be engaged, I will at least make notes. This\r\nmanuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who\r\nknow him, and who hear it from his own lips—with what interest and\r\nsympathy shall I read it in some future day! Even now, as I commence my\r\ntask, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me\r\nwith all their melancholy sweetness; I see his thin hand raised in\r\nanimation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul\r\nwithin. Strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which\r\nembraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it—thus!\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap01\"></a>Chapter 1</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nI am by birth a Genevese, and my family is one of the most\r\ndistinguished of that republic.  My ancestors had been for many years\r\ncounsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public\r\nsituations with honour and reputation.  He was respected by all who\r\nknew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public\r\nbusiness.  He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the\r\naffairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his\r\nmarrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a\r\nhusband and the father of a family.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, I cannot\r\nrefrain from relating them.  One of his most intimate friends was a\r\nmerchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous\r\nmischances, into poverty.  This man, whose name was Beaufort, was of a\r\nproud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty\r\nand oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been\r\ndistinguished for his rank and magnificence.  Having paid his debts,\r\ntherefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his\r\ndaughter to the town of Lucerne, where he lived unknown and in\r\nwretchedness.  My father loved Beaufort with the truest friendship and\r\nwas deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.\r\nHe bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct\r\nso little worthy of the affection that united them.  He lost no time in\r\nendeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin\r\nthe world again through his credit and assistance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten\r\nmonths before my father discovered his abode. Overjoyed at this discovery,\r\nhe hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the\r\nReuss. But when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. Beaufort\r\nhad saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but\r\nit was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in\r\nthe meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a\r\nmerchant’s house. The interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;\r\nhis grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for\r\nreflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end\r\nof three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw\r\nwith despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that\r\nthere was no other prospect of support.  But Caroline Beaufort\r\npossessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support\r\nher in her adversity.  She procured plain work; she plaited straw and\r\nby various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to\r\nsupport life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral months passed in this manner.  Her father grew worse; her time\r\nwas more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence\r\ndecreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving\r\nher an orphan and a beggar.  This last blow overcame her, and she knelt\r\nby Beaufort’s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the\r\nchamber.  He came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who\r\ncommitted herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he\r\nconducted her to Geneva and placed her under the protection of a\r\nrelation.  Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but\r\nthis circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted\r\naffection.  There was a sense of justice in my father’s upright mind\r\nwhich rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\r\nstrongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\r\nlate-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\r\na greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and\r\nworship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\r\ndoting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\r\nvirtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\r\nher for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\r\nto his behaviour to her.  Everything was made to yield to her wishes\r\nand her convenience.  He strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is\r\nsheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\r\nwith all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and\r\nbenevolent mind.  Her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto\r\nconstant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through.  During\r\nthe two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had\r\ngradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after\r\ntheir union they sought the pleasant climate of Italy, and the change\r\nof scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,\r\nas a restorative for her weakened frame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom Italy they visited Germany and France. I, their eldest child, was born\r\nat Naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. I remained\r\nfor several years their only child. Much as they were attached to each\r\nother, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very\r\nmine of love to bestow them upon me. My mother’s tender caresses and\r\nmy father’s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my\r\nfirst recollections. I was their plaything and their idol, and something\r\nbetter—their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on\r\nthem by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\r\ntheir hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\r\ntheir duties towards me. With this deep consciousness of what they owed\r\ntowards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\r\nof tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\r\nevery hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\r\nand of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\r\none train of enjoyment to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\r\ndaughter, but I continued their single offspring. When I was about five\r\nyears old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\r\npassed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\r\ndisposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\r\nmother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\r\npassion—remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\r\nrelieved—for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\r\nafflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\r\nattracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\r\nof half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\r\nshape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\r\naccompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\r\nhard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\r\nfive hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\r\nabove all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\r\ndark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\r\nhair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\r\nclothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\r\nclear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\r\nher face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\r\nher without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\r\nand bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\r\nadmiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\r\nnot her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\r\nGerman and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\r\nthese good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\r\nlong married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\r\ncharge was one of those Italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory\r\nof Italy—one among the <i>schiavi ognor frementi,</i> who exerted\r\nhimself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\r\nweakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\r\nwas not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\r\na beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\r\nabode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen my father returned from Milan, he found playing with me in the hall of\r\nour villa a child fairer than pictured cherub—a creature who seemed\r\nto shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter\r\nthan the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\r\npermission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\r\ncharge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\r\na blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\r\nand want when Providence afforded her such powerful protection. They\r\nconsulted their village priest, and the result was that Elizabeth Lavenza\r\nbecame the inmate of my parents’ house—my more than\r\nsister—the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and\r\nmy pleasures.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEveryone loved Elizabeth.  The passionate and almost reverential\r\nattachment with which all regarded her became, while I shared it, my\r\npride and my delight.  On the evening previous to her being brought to\r\nmy home, my mother had said playfully, “I have a pretty present for my\r\nVictor—tomorrow he shall have it.”  And when, on the morrow, she\r\npresented Elizabeth to me as her promised gift, I, with childish\r\nseriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon Elizabeth\r\nas mine—mine to protect, love, and cherish.  All praises bestowed on\r\nher I received as made to a possession of my own.  We called each other\r\nfamiliarly by the name of cousin.  No word, no expression could body\r\nforth the kind of relation in which she stood to me—my more than\r\nsister, since till death she was to be mine only.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>Chapter 2</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in\r\nour ages.  I need not say that we were strangers to any species of\r\ndisunion or dispute.  Harmony was the soul of our companionship, and\r\nthe diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us\r\nnearer together.  Elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated\r\ndisposition; but, with all my ardour, I was capable of a more intense\r\napplication and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.\r\nShe busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;\r\nand in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our Swiss\r\nhome —the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,\r\ntempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of\r\nour Alpine summers—she found ample scope for admiration and delight.\r\nWhile my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the\r\nmagnificent appearances of things, I delighted in investigating their\r\ncauses.  The world was to me a secret which I desired to divine.\r\nCuriosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,\r\ngladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the\r\nearliest sensations I can remember.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave\r\nup entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native\r\ncountry. We possessed a house in Geneva, and a <i>campagne</i> on Belrive,\r\nthe eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a\r\nleague from the city. We resided principally in the latter, and the\r\nlives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. It was my\r\ntemper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. I was\r\nindifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but I united\r\nmyself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. Henry\r\nClerval was the son of a merchant of Geneva. He was a boy of singular\r\ntalent and fancy. He loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for\r\nits own sake. He was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance.  He\r\ncomposed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and\r\nknightly adventure. He tried to make us act plays and to enter into\r\nmasquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of\r\nRoncesvalles, of the Round Table of King Arthur, and the chivalrous\r\ntrain who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands\r\nof the infidels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself.  My\r\nparents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.\r\nWe felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to\r\ntheir caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights\r\nwhich we enjoyed.  When I mingled with other families I distinctly\r\ndiscerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted\r\nthe development of filial love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some\r\nlaw in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits\r\nbut to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things\r\nindiscriminately.  I confess that neither the structure of languages,\r\nnor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states\r\npossessed attractions for me.  It was the secrets of heaven and earth\r\nthat I desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of\r\nthings or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man\r\nthat occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,\r\nor in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMeanwhile Clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral\r\nrelations of things.  The busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,\r\nand the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was\r\nto become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the\r\ngallant and adventurous benefactors of our species.  The saintly soul\r\nof Elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.\r\nHer sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of\r\nher celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us.  She was\r\nthe living spirit of love to soften and attract; I might have become\r\nsullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that\r\nshe was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness.  And\r\nClerval—could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of Clerval?  Yet\r\nhe might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his\r\ngenerosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for\r\nadventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of\r\nbeneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring\r\nambition.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,\r\nbefore misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of\r\nextensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. Besides,\r\nin drawing the picture of my early days, I also record those events which\r\nled, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when I would\r\naccount to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my\r\ndestiny I find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost\r\nforgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent\r\nwhich, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNatural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; I desire,\r\ntherefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my\r\npredilection for that science. When I was thirteen years of age we all went\r\non a party of pleasure to the baths near Thonon; the inclemency of the\r\nweather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. In this house I\r\nchanced to find a volume of the works of Cornelius Agrippa. I opened it\r\nwith apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful\r\nfacts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. A new\r\nlight seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, I communicated my\r\ndiscovery to my father. My father looked carelessly at the title page of my\r\nbook and said, “Ah! Cornelius Agrippa! My dear Victor, do not waste\r\nyour time upon this; it is sad trash.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me\r\nthat the principles of Agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern\r\nsystem of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers\r\nthan the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while\r\nthose of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances I\r\nshould certainly have thrown Agrippa aside and have contented my\r\nimagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my\r\nformer studies. It is even possible that the train of my ideas would never\r\nhave received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. But the cursory glance\r\nmy father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was\r\nacquainted with its contents, and I continued to read with the greatest\r\navidity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this\r\nauthor, and afterwards of Paracelsus and Albertus Magnus. I read and\r\nstudied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me\r\ntreasures known to few besides myself. I have described myself as always\r\nhaving been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of\r\nnature. In spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern\r\nphilosophers, I always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.\r\nSir Isaac Newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking\r\nup shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. Those of his\r\nsuccessors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom I was acquainted\r\nappeared even to my boy’s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same\r\npursuit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted\r\nwith their practical uses.  The most learned philosopher knew little\r\nmore.  He had partially unveiled the face of Nature, but her immortal\r\nlineaments were still a wonder and a mystery.  He might dissect,\r\nanatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes\r\nin their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him.  I\r\nhad gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep\r\nhuman beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and\r\nignorantly I had repined.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew\r\nmore. I took their word for all that they averred, and I became their\r\ndisciple. It may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth\r\ncentury; but while I followed the routine of education in the schools of\r\nGeneva, I was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite\r\nstudies. My father was not scientific, and I was left to struggle with a\r\nchild’s blindness, added to a student’s thirst for knowledge.\r\nUnder the guidance of my new preceptors I entered with the greatest\r\ndiligence into the search of the philosopher’s stone and the elixir\r\nof life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. Wealth was an\r\ninferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if I could\r\nbanish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but\r\na violent death!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNor were these my only visions. The raising of ghosts or devils was a\r\npromise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which\r\nI most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, I\r\nattributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a\r\nwant of skill or fidelity in my instructors. And thus for a time I was\r\noccupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand\r\ncontradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of\r\nmultifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish\r\nreasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near\r\nBelrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. It\r\nadvanced from behind the mountains of Jura, and the thunder burst at once\r\nwith frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. I remained,\r\nwhile the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.\r\nAs I stood at the door, on a sudden I beheld a stream of fire issue from an\r\nold and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so\r\nsoon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing\r\nremained but a blasted stump. When we visited it the next morning, we found\r\nthe tree shattered in a singular manner. It was not splintered by the\r\nshock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. I never beheld\r\nanything so utterly destroyed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore this I was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of\r\nelectricity.  On this occasion a man of great research in natural\r\nphilosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on\r\nthe explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of\r\nelectricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.\r\nAll that he said threw greatly into the shade Cornelius Agrippa,\r\nAlbertus Magnus, and Paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by\r\nsome fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my\r\naccustomed studies.  It seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever\r\nbe known.  All that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew\r\ndespicable.  By one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps\r\nmost subject to in early youth, I at once gave up my former\r\noccupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed\r\nand abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a\r\nwould-be science which could never even step within the threshold of\r\nreal knowledge.  In this mood of mind I betook myself to the\r\nmathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as\r\nbeing built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments\r\nare we bound to prosperity or ruin.  When I look back, it seems to me\r\nas if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the\r\nimmediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life—the last effort\r\nmade by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even\r\nthen hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me.  Her victory was\r\nannounced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which\r\nfollowed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting\r\nstudies.  It was thus that I was to be taught to associate evil with\r\ntheir prosecution, happiness with their disregard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.\r\nDestiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and\r\nterrible destruction.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap03\"></a>Chapter 3</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that I\r\nshould become a student at the university of Ingolstadt.  I had\r\nhitherto attended the schools of Geneva, but my father thought it\r\nnecessary for the completion of my education that I should be made\r\nacquainted with other customs than those of my native country.  My\r\ndeparture was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day\r\nresolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life\r\noccurred—an omen, as it were, of my future misery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was\r\nin the greatest danger. During her illness many arguments had been urged to\r\npersuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. She had at first\r\nyielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her\r\nfavourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. She\r\nattended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity\r\nof the distemper—Elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this\r\nimprudence were fatal to her preserver. On the third day my mother\r\nsickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the\r\nlooks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. On her\r\ndeathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert\r\nher. She joined the hands of Elizabeth and myself. “My\r\nchildren,” she said, “my firmest hopes of future happiness were\r\nplaced on the prospect of your union. This expectation will now be the\r\nconsolation of your father. Elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to\r\nmy younger children. Alas! I regret that I am taken from you; and, happy\r\nand beloved as I have been, is it not hard to quit you all? But these are\r\nnot thoughts befitting me; I will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to\r\ndeath and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.\r\nI need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent\r\nby that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the\r\nsoul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance.  It is so\r\nlong before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day\r\nand whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed\r\nfor ever—that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been\r\nextinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear\r\ncan be hushed, never more to be heard.  These are the reflections of\r\nthe first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the\r\nevil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences.  Yet from whom has\r\nnot that rude hand rent away some dear connection?  And why should I\r\ndescribe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel?  The time at\r\nlength arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and\r\nthe smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a\r\nsacrilege, is not banished.  My mother was dead, but we had still\r\nduties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the\r\nrest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the\r\nspoiler has not seized.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy departure for Ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,\r\nwas now again determined upon.  I obtained from my father a respite of\r\nsome weeks.  It appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,\r\nakin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of\r\nlife.  I was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me.  I was\r\nunwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above\r\nall, I desired to see my sweet Elizabeth in some degree consoled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.\r\nShe looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and\r\nzeal.  She devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call\r\nher uncle and cousins.  Never was she so enchanting as at this time,\r\nwhen she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.\r\nShe forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe day of my departure at length arrived.  Clerval spent the last\r\nevening with us.  He had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit\r\nhim to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain.  His\r\nfather was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the\r\naspirations and ambition of his son.  Henry deeply felt the misfortune\r\nof being debarred from a liberal education.  He said little, but when\r\nhe spoke I read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a\r\nrestrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details\r\nof commerce.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe sat late.  We could not tear ourselves away from each other nor\r\npersuade ourselves to say the word “Farewell!”  It was said, and we\r\nretired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the\r\nother was deceived; but when at morning’s dawn I descended to the\r\ncarriage which was to convey me away, they were all there—my father\r\nagain to bless me, Clerval to press my hand once more, my Elizabeth to\r\nrenew her entreaties that I would write often and to bestow the last\r\nfeminine attentions on her playmate and friend.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in\r\nthe most melancholy reflections.  I, who had ever been surrounded by\r\namiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual\r\npleasure—I was now alone.  In the university whither I was going I\r\nmust form my own friends and be my own protector.  My life had hitherto\r\nbeen remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible\r\nrepugnance to new countenances.  I loved my brothers, Elizabeth, and\r\nClerval; these were “old familiar faces,” but I believed myself\r\ntotally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my reflections as\r\nI commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.  I\r\nardently desired the acquisition of knowledge.  I had often, when at home,\r\nthought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had\r\nlonged to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\r\nNow my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to\r\nrepent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my\r\njourney to Ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing.  At length the\r\nhigh white steeple of the town met my eyes.  I alighted and was\r\nconducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as I pleased.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next morning I delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to\r\nsome of the principal professors.  Chance—or rather the evil\r\ninfluence, the Angel of Destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me\r\nfrom the moment I turned my reluctant steps from my father’s\r\ndoor—led me first to M. Krempe, professor of natural philosophy.  He\r\nwas an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. He\r\nasked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches\r\nof science appertaining to natural philosophy.  I replied carelessly, and\r\npartly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal\r\nauthors I had studied.  The professor stared.  “Have you,” he\r\nsaid, “really spent your time in studying such nonsense?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI replied in the affirmative.  “Every minute,” continued M. Krempe with\r\nwarmth, “every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\r\nand entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\r\nand useless names.  Good God!  In what desert land have you lived,\r\nwhere no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\r\nhave so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\r\nare ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\r\nage, to find a disciple of Albertus Magnus and Paracelsus.  My dear\r\nsir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\r\ntreating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\r\ndismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\r\nweek he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\r\nphilosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\r\nprofessor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\r\nomitted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\r\nconsidered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\r\nreturned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\r\nshape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\r\nrepulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\r\nfavour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a\r\nstrain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\r\nto concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been\r\ncontent with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\r\nscience.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\r\nextreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\r\nsteps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\r\ndiscoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\r\nBesides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\r\nIt was very different when the masters of the science sought\r\nimmortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\r\nthe scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\r\nitself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\r\nscience was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of\r\nboundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\r\nresidence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\r\nacquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\r\nabode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\r\nwhich M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I\r\ncould not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\r\nsentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\r\nWaldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPartly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\r\nroom, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\r\nunlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\r\naspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\r\ntemples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\r\nwas short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\r\nHe began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\r\nthe various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\r\nwith fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\r\na cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\r\nits elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\r\nconcluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\r\nshall never forget:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The ancient teachers of this science,” said he,\r\n“promised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\r\npromise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\r\nthe elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\r\nonly made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\r\ncrucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\r\nof nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\r\nheavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\r\nthe air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\r\nthey can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\r\nmock the invisible world with its own shadows.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch were the professor’s words—rather let me say such the words of\r\nthe fate—enounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul\r\nwere grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\r\ntouched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\r\nsounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\r\none purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\r\nFrankenstein—more, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\r\nalready marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\r\nunfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of\r\ninsurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\r\nhad no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morning’s dawn,\r\nsleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternight’s thoughts were as a dream.\r\nThere only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\r\ndevote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\r\nnatural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His\r\nmanners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\r\nfor there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\r\nhis own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I\r\ngave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\r\ngiven to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little\r\nnarration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\r\nAgrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\r\nexhibited. He said that “These were men to whose indefatigable zeal\r\nmodern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\r\nknowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\r\nand arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\r\ngreat degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The\r\nlabours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\r\nfail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.”  I\r\nlistened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\r\nor affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\r\nprejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\r\nterms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\r\ninstructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\r\nmade me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\r\nlabours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\r\nprocure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am happy,” said M. Waldman, “to have gained a\r\ndisciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\r\nyour success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\r\ngreatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\r\nI have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\r\nneglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\r\nchemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\r\nwish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\r\nexperimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\r\nphilosophy, including mathematics.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\r\nvarious machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\r\npromising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\r\nthe science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\r\nbooks which I had requested, and I took my leave.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap04\"></a>Chapter 4</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\r\nmost comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\r\nI read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\r\nwhich modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the\r\nlectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\r\nuniversity, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\r\nand real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\r\nphysiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In\r\nM. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by\r\ndogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\r\ngood nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways\r\nhe smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\r\ninquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at\r\nfirst fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\r\nsoon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\r\nlight of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\r\nwas rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\r\nmy proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,\r\nwith a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\r\nexpressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years\r\npassed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\r\nengaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\r\nhoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive\r\nof the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as\r\nothers have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\r\na scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\r\nA mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\r\ninfallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\r\ncontinually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\r\nsolely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\r\nyears I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\r\ninstruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\r\nuniversity.  When I had arrived at this point and had become as well\r\nacquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as\r\ndepended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt, my\r\nresidence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, I thought\r\nof returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident\r\nhappened that protracted my stay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\r\nthe structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\r\nlife.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\r\nIt was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\r\nmystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\r\nacquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\r\ninquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\r\nthenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\r\nnatural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been\r\nanimated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\r\nstudy would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the\r\ncauses of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I became\r\nacquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\r\nmust also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\r\nIn my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\r\nmind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever\r\nremember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared\r\nthe apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\r\na churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of\r\nlife, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become\r\nfood for the worm.  Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of\r\nthis decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and\r\ncharnel-houses.  My attention was fixed upon every object the most\r\ninsupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.  I saw how the\r\nfine form of man was degraded and wasted; I beheld the corruption of\r\ndeath succeed to the blooming cheek of life; I saw how the worm\r\ninherited the wonders of the eye and brain.  I paused, examining and\r\nanalysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change\r\nfrom life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this\r\ndarkness a sudden light broke in upon me—a light so brilliant and\r\nwondrous, yet so simple, that while I became dizzy with the immensity\r\nof the prospect which it illustrated, I was surprised that among so\r\nmany men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same\r\nscience, that I alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a\r\nsecret.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nRemember, I am not recording the vision of a madman.  The sun does not\r\nmore certainly shine in the heavens than that which I now affirm is\r\ntrue.  Some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the\r\ndiscovery were distinct and probable.  After days and nights of\r\nincredible labour and fatigue, I succeeded in discovering the cause of\r\ngeneration and life; nay, more, I became myself capable of bestowing\r\nanimation upon lifeless matter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe astonishment which I had at first experienced on this discovery\r\nsoon gave place to delight and rapture.  After so much time spent in\r\npainful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the\r\nmost gratifying consummation of my toils.  But this discovery was so\r\ngreat and overwhelming that all the steps by which I had been\r\nprogressively led to it were obliterated, and I beheld only the result.\r\nWhat had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation\r\nof the world was now within my grasp.  Not that, like a magic scene, it\r\nall opened upon me at once:  the information I had obtained was of a\r\nnature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as I should point them\r\ntowards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\r\naccomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\r\nand found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly\r\nineffectual light.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes\r\nexpress, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with\r\nwhich I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end\r\nof my story, and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that\r\nsubject.  I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as I then was,\r\nto your destruction and infallible misery.  Learn from me, if not by my\r\nprecepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of\r\nknowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town\r\nto be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature\r\nwill allow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated\r\na long time concerning the manner in which I should employ it.\r\nAlthough I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to\r\nprepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of\r\nfibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable\r\ndifficulty and labour.  I doubted at first whether I should attempt the\r\ncreation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my\r\nimagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to\r\ndoubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful\r\nas man.  The materials at present within my command hardly appeared\r\nadequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should\r\nultimately succeed.  I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my\r\noperations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be\r\nimperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\r\nplace in science and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present\r\nattempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor\r\ncould I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\r\nargument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I\r\nbegan the creation of a human being.  As the minuteness of the parts\r\nformed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\r\nintention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\r\nabout eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having\r\nformed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\r\ncollecting and arranging my materials, I began.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\r\na hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death\r\nappeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\r\npour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless\r\nme as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\r\nowe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his\r\nchild so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these\r\nreflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\r\nmatter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\r\nrenew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\r\nwith unremitting ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\r\nperson had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on the very\r\nbrink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\r\nnext day or the next hour might realise.  One secret which I alone\r\npossessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\r\ngazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\r\neagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who shall conceive\r\nthe horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\r\nof the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\r\nclay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\r\nthen a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\r\nto have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was\r\nindeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\r\nacuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\r\nreturned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and\r\ndisturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\r\nframe.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\r\nand separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\r\nI kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\r\ntheir sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The\r\ndissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\r\nand often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\r\nwhilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\r\nbrought my work near to a conclusion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\r\none pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\r\nbestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\r\nvintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the\r\nsame feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\r\nto forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\r\nnot seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\r\nwell remembered the words of my father:  “I know that while you are\r\npleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\r\nhear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any\r\ninterruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties\r\nare equally neglected.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI knew well therefore what would be my father’s feelings, but I could\r\nnot tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\r\nhad taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.  I wished, as it\r\nwere, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\r\nuntil the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\r\nshould be completed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\r\nto vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\r\njustified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\r\nblame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\r\npeaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\r\ndisturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\r\nis an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself\r\nhas a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\r\nthose simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\r\nstudy is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\r\nmind.  If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\r\nwhatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic\r\naffections, Greece had not been enslaved, Cæsar would have spared his\r\ncountry, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the\r\nempires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I forget that I am moralizing in the most interesting part of my\r\ntale, and your looks remind me to proceed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my\r\nsilence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.\r\nWinter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but I did not\r\nwatch the blossom or the expanding leaves—sights which before always\r\nyielded me supreme delight—so deeply was I engrossed in my\r\noccupation. The leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near\r\nto a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well I had\r\nsucceeded. But my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and I appeared\r\nrather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other\r\nunwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.\r\nEvery night I was oppressed by a slow fever, and I became nervous to a most\r\npainful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and I shunned my fellow\r\ncreatures as if I had been guilty of a crime. Sometimes I grew alarmed at\r\nthe wreck I perceived that I had become; the energy of my purpose alone\r\nsustained me: my labours would soon end, and I believed that exercise and\r\namusement would then drive away incipient disease; and I promised myself\r\nboth of these when my creation should be complete.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap05\"></a>Chapter 5</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\r\nof my toils.  With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\r\ncollected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\r\nspark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was\r\nalready one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\r\npanes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\r\nhalf-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\r\nopen; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\r\nthe wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\r\nform?  His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\r\nbeautiful.  Beautiful!  Great God!  His yellow skin scarcely covered\r\nthe work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\r\nblack, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\r\nluxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\r\nthat seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\r\nthey were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\r\nof human nature.  I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\r\npurpose of infusing life into an inanimate body.  For this I had\r\ndeprived myself of rest and health.  I had desired it with an ardour\r\nthat far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\r\nof the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\r\nheart.  Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\r\nrushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\r\nbed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.  At length lassitude\r\nsucceeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\r\nbed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\r\nBut it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\r\ndreams.  I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\r\nthe streets of Ingolstadt.  Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\r\nbut as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\r\nthe hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\r\nheld the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\r\nform, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\r\nI started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\r\nteeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\r\nyellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\r\nshutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\r\ncreated.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\r\nmay be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some\r\ninarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have\r\nspoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\r\ndetain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the\r\ncourtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\r\nduring the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\r\nagitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\r\nit were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\r\nhad so miserably given life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOh!  No mortal could support the horror of that countenance.  A mummy\r\nagain endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch.  I\r\nhad gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\r\nmuscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\r\nsuch as even Dante could not have conceived.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI passed the night wretchedly.  Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\r\nhardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\r\nsank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness.  Mingled with\r\nthis horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\r\nbeen my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\r\nhell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMorning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\r\nsleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\r\nand clock, which indicated the sixth hour.  The porter opened the gates\r\nof the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\r\nthe streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\r\nwretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\r\nview.  I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\r\nfelt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\r\nfrom a black and comfortless sky.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\r\nbodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind.  I\r\ntraversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\r\nwhat I was doing.  My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\r\nhurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n  Like one who, on a lonely road,<br>\r\n  Doth walk in fear and dread,<br>\r\n  And, having once turned round, walks on,<br>\r\n  And turns no more his head;<br>\r\n  Because he knows a frightful fiend<br>\r\n  Doth close behind him tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nContinuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\r\ndiligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\r\nbut I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\r\ntowards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\r\nthat it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\r\non the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\r\ninstantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\r\n“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\r\nthe very moment of my alighting!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\r\nto my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\r\nto my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\r\nand misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\r\ncalm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\r\nmanner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\r\nsome time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\r\npermitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\r\nhe, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\r\nnecessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\r\nand, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\r\nanswer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\r\nschoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\r\na year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\r\naffection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\r\npermitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\r\nknowledge.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\r\nmy father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\r\nyou so seldom.  By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\r\naccount myself.  But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\r\nshort and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\r\nyou appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\r\nseveral nights.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\r\noccupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\r\nbut I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\r\nend and that I am at length free.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\r\nallude to, the occurrences of the preceding night.  I walked with a\r\nquick pace, and we soon arrived at my college.  I then reflected, and\r\nthe thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\r\napartment might still be there, alive and walking about.  I dreaded to\r\nbehold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\r\nEntreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\r\nstairs, I darted up towards my own room.  My hand was already on the\r\nlock of the door before I recollected myself.  I then paused, and a\r\ncold shivering came over me.  I threw the door forcibly open, as\r\nchildren are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\r\nwaiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.  I stepped\r\nfearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\r\nfrom its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good\r\nfortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\r\nhad indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\r\nbut I was unable to contain myself.  It was not joy only that possessed\r\nme; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\r\nbeat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\r\nplace; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\r\nClerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\r\nbut when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\r\nfor which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\r\nlaughter frightened and astonished him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\r\nis the matter?  Do not laugh in that manner.  How ill you are!  What is the\r\ncause of all this?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\r\nthought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “<i>he</i> can\r\ntell. Oh, save me!  Save me!”  I imagined that the monster seized me;\r\nI struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Clerval!  What must have been his feelings?  A meeting, which he\r\nanticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.  But I\r\nwas not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\r\nrecover my senses for a long, long time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\r\nseveral months.  During all that time Henry was my only nurse.  I\r\nafterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\r\nfor so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\r\nElizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\r\ndisorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\r\nnurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\r\ndid not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\r\naction that he could towards them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\r\nunremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\r\nThe form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\r\nbefore my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my\r\nwords surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\r\nof my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\r\ncontinually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\r\nindeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\r\ngrieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became\r\ncapable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\r\nperceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\r\nbuds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was\r\na divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\r\nconvalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\r\nmy bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\r\ncheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\r\nyou are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\r\npromised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\r\nrepay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\r\nhave been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\r\nwell as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\r\nmay speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\r\nwhom I dared not even think?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\r\ncolour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\r\nand cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\r\nown handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\r\nyour long silence.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is that all, my dear Henry?  How could you suppose that my first\r\nthought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\r\nwho are so deserving of my love?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\r\nto see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\r\nyour cousin, I believe.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap06\"></a>Chapter 6</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nClerval then put the following letter into my hands.  It was from my\r\nown Elizabeth:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\n“My dearest Cousin,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\r\nkind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account.  You are\r\nforbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\r\nis necessary to calm our apprehensions.  For a long time I have thought\r\nthat each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\r\nrestrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt.  I have\r\nprevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\r\nlong a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\r\nperform it myself!  I figure to myself that the task of attending on\r\nyour sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\r\nguess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\r\nyour poor cousin.  Yet that is over now:  Clerval writes that indeed\r\nyou are getting better.  I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\r\nintelligence soon in your own handwriting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Get well—and return to us.  You will find a happy, cheerful home and\r\nfriends who love you dearly.  Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\r\nasks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\r\ncare will ever cloud his benevolent countenance.  How pleased you would\r\nbe to remark the improvement of our Ernest!  He is now sixteen and full\r\nof activity and spirit.  He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\r\ninto foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\r\nelder brother returns to us.  My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\r\na military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\r\npowers of application.  He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\r\ntime is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\r\nlake.  I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\r\nand permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\r\nplace since you left us.  The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\r\nnever change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\r\nregulated by the same immutable laws.  My trifling occupations take up\r\nmy time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\r\nnone but happy, kind faces around me.  Since you left us, but one\r\nchange has taken place in our little household.  Do you remember on\r\nwhat occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?  Probably you do not;\r\nI will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz,\r\nher mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\r\nthird.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\r\nthrough a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\r\nafter the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed\r\nthis, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\r\nto allow her to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our\r\ncountry have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\r\nprevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less\r\ndistinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\r\nlower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\r\nmore refined and moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\r\nthing as a servant in France and England.  Justine, thus received in\r\nour family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\r\nfortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\r\nsacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\r\nrecollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\r\nglance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\r\nAriosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\r\nfrank-hearted and happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\r\nby which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\r\nwhich she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;\r\nJustine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not\r\nmean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\r\nyou could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\r\nAlthough her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\r\nyet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She\r\nthought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\r\nphraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\r\ngrief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\r\nwith the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very ill; but other\r\ntrials were reserved for her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\r\nexception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.  The\r\nconscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\r\ndeaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\r\npartiality.  She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\r\nconfirmed the idea which she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months\r\nafter your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\r\nrepentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; she\r\nwas much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\r\nand a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\r\nfor vivacity.  Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\r\nto restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her\r\nrepentance.  She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\r\nbut much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\r\nbrothers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\r\ninto a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\r\nnow at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather,\r\nat the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us;\r\nand I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is very clever and gentle,\r\nand extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\r\nexpression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\r\nWilliam.  I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\r\nsweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair.  When he\r\nsmiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\r\nhealth.  He has already had one or two little <i>wives,</i> but Louisa Biron\r\nis his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\r\ngossip concerning the good people of Geneva.  The pretty Miss Mansfield\r\nhas already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\r\nmarriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq.  Her ugly\r\nsister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\r\nfavourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\r\nsince the departure of Clerval from Geneva.  But he has already\r\nrecovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\r\nlively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier.  She is a widow, and much\r\nolder than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\r\neverybody.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\r\nreturns upon me as I conclude.  Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one\r\nword will be a blessing to us.  Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\r\nkindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\r\ngrateful.  Adieu!  my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\r\nyou, write!\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\n“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”<br><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her\r\nletter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\r\nthey must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\r\nmy convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\r\nfortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\r\nseveral professors of the university.  In doing this, I underwent a\r\nkind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\r\nsustained.  Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\r\nbeginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\r\nto the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite restored\r\nto health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\r\nof my nervous symptoms.  Henry saw this, and had removed all my\r\napparatus from my view.  He had also changed my apartment; for he\r\nperceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\r\npreviously been my laboratory.  But these cares of Clerval were made of\r\nno avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted torture\r\nwhen he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\r\nhad made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the\r\nsubject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\r\nmodesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\r\nitself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  What\r\ncould I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he\r\nhad placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\r\nwere to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death.  I\r\nwrithed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\r\nClerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\r\nsensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\r\ntotal ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn.  I\r\nthanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak.  I saw plainly\r\nthat he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\r\nme; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\r\nthat knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\r\nhim that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\r\nI feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nM. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\r\nalmost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\r\nmore pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n\r\nthe fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\r\noutstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\r\nyoungster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\r\nas in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\r\nhe is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\r\nay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\r\n“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\r\nYoung men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\r\nmyself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nM. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\r\nthe conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\r\nliterary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me.  He\r\ncame to the university with the design of making himself complete\r\nmaster of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\r\nthe plan of life he had marked out for himself.  Resolved to pursue no\r\ninglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\r\nscope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\r\nlanguages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\r\nthe same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\r\nwished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\r\ngreat relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\r\nonly instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.  I\r\ndid not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\r\nI did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\r\namusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\r\nrepaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\r\nelevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\r\nany other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to\r\nconsist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\r\nof a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.  How\r\ndifferent from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSummer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\r\nfixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\r\naccidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\r\nand my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.  I felt this\r\ndelay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\r\nfriends.  My return had only been delayed so long, from an\r\nunwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\r\nacquainted with any of its inhabitants.  The winter, however, was spent\r\ncheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\r\nits beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\r\nwhich was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\r\npedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\r\npersonal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited.  I acceded\r\nwith pleasure to this proposition:  I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\r\nhad always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\r\nthat I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe passed a fortnight in these perambulations:  my health and spirits\r\nhad long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\r\nsalubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\r\nthe conversation of my friend.  Study had before secluded me from the\r\nintercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\r\nClerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\r\nme to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\r\nExcellent friend!  how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\r\nelevate my mind until it was on a level with your own.  A selfish\r\npursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\r\naffection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\r\nwho, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\r\nWhen happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\r\ndelightful sensations.  A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\r\necstasy.  The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\r\nbloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud.  I\r\nwas undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\r\nupon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\r\ninvincible burden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHenry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\r\nexerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\r\nhis soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\r\nastonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\r\nimitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\r\nfancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\r\nme out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\r\ndancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\r\nhigh, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap07\"></a>Chapter 7</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nOn my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\n“My dear Victor,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\r\nyour return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\r\nlines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you.  But\r\nthat would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it.  What would be\r\nyour surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\r\nbehold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness?  And how, Victor, can\r\nI relate our misfortune?  Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\r\nour joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\r\nson?  I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\r\nimpossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\r\nwhich are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\r\nmy heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay!  Victor, he is murdered!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\r\ncircumstances of the transaction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\r\nwalk in Plainpalais.  The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\r\nour walk farther than usual.  It was already dusk before we thought of\r\nreturning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\r\non before, were not to be found.  We accordingly rested on a seat until\r\nthey should return.  Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\r\nhis brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\r\nhad run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\r\nafterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\r\nuntil night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\r\nreturned to the house.  He was not there.  We returned again, with\r\ntorches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\r\nlost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\r\nElizabeth also suffered extreme anguish.  About five in the morning I\r\ndiscovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\r\nactive in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\r\nprint of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\r\ncountenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth.  She was very earnest to\r\nsee the corpse.  At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\r\nand entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\r\nvictim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God!  I have murdered my\r\ndarling child!’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty.  When she again\r\nlived, it was only to weep and sigh.  She told me, that that same\r\nevening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\r\nminiature that she possessed of your mother.  This picture is gone, and\r\nwas doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed.  We\r\nhave no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\r\nare unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth.  She weeps\r\ncontinually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\r\nher words pierce my heart.  We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\r\nadditional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\r\nYour dear mother!  Alas, Victor!  I now say, Thank God she did not live\r\nto witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\r\nbut with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\r\nfestering, the wounds of our minds.  Enter the house of mourning, my\r\nfriend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\r\nwith hatred for your enemies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\n“Your affectionate and afflicted father,<br>\r\n“Alphonse Frankenstein.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\n“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”<br><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\r\nsurprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\r\nexpressed on receiving new from my friends.  I threw the letter on the\r\ntable, and covered my face with my hands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\r\nweep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy?  My dear friend,\r\nwhat has happened?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\r\nroom in the extremest agitation.  Tears also gushed from the eyes of\r\nClerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\r\n“your disaster is irreparable.  What do you intend to do?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\r\nhe could only express his heartfelt sympathy.  “Poor William!” said he,\r\n“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother!  Who that had\r\nseen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\r\nuntimely loss!  To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp!  How\r\nmuch more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence!  Poor little\r\nfellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\r\nhe is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\r\nA sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain.  He can no longer\r\nbe a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\r\nsurvivors.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\r\nimpressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\r\nsolitude.  But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\r\ncabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\r\nto console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\r\ndrew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\r\nthe multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\r\nscenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\r\nHow altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\r\ndesolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\r\nmight have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\r\ndone more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\r\ndared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\r\nalthough I was unable to define them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\r\ncontemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\r\nsnowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By\r\ndegrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\r\ntowards Geneva.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\r\napproached my native town.  I discovered more distinctly the black\r\nsides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc.  I wept like a\r\nchild.  “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\r\nwanderer?  Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\r\nplacid.  Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\r\nthese preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\r\nhappiness, and I think of them with pleasure.  My country, my beloved\r\ncountry! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\r\nbeholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\r\nlake!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\r\nclosed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\r\nmore gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\r\nforesaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\r\nbeings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\r\ncircumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\r\nconceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\r\nof the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\r\nSecheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\r\nwas serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\r\nwhere my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\r\ntown, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\r\nDuring this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\r\nBlanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\r\nrapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\r\nprogress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\r\ncoming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\r\nincreased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\r\nover my head.  It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\r\nSavoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\r\nlake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\r\nevery thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\r\nfrom the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in\r\nSwitzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\r\nmost violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\r\nlake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\r\nCopêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\r\ndarkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\r\neast of the lake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\r\na hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\r\nhands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\r\nfuneral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\r\ngloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\r\nfixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\r\nilluminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\r\ngigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\r\nto humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\r\ndæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\r\nshuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\r\nidea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\r\nchattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\r\npassed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\r\nhave destroyed the fair child. <i>He</i> was the murderer! I could not\r\ndoubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\r\nfact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\r\nanother flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\r\nperpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\r\nsouth. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain still\r\ncontinued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  I\r\nrevolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\r\nthe whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\r\nthe works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had\r\nnow nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\r\nwas this his first crime?  Alas!  I had turned loose into the world a\r\ndepraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\r\nmurdered my brother?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\r\nnight, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  But I did not\r\nfeel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\r\nscenes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast\r\namong mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\r\nof horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\r\nof my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\r\nto destroy all that was dear to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDay dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.  The gates were\r\nopen, and I hastened to my father’s house.  My first thought was to\r\ndiscover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\r\nmade.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\r\nbeing whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\r\nmidnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I\r\nremembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\r\nthe time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\r\ndelirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  I well knew that\r\nif any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\r\nlooked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature\r\nof the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\r\nas to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would\r\nbe pursuit?  Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\r\noverhanging sides of Mont Salêve?  These reflections determined me, and\r\nI resolved to remain silent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house.  I\r\ntold the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\r\nto attend their usual hour of rising.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSix years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\r\nstood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\r\ndeparture for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\r\nto me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\r\nmantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\r\ndesire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\r\nby the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\r\nbut there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\r\nsentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\r\ntears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\r\nentered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\r\n“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\r\nhad come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\r\ndelighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\r\nalleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\r\nsinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\r\nElizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\r\nWilliam! he was our darling and our pride!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\r\nagony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the\r\nwretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\r\na not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\r\nminutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\r\nherself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\r\nvery wretched.  But since the murderer has been discovered—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\r\nto pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\r\nwinds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he\r\nwas free last night!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\r\nwonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery.  No\r\none would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\r\nconvinced, notwithstanding all the evidence.  Indeed, who would credit\r\nthat Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\r\ncould suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Justine Moritz!  Poor, poor girl, is she the accused?  But it is\r\nwrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\r\nalmost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\r\nconfused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\r\nleaves no hope for doubt.  But she will be tried today, and you will\r\nthen hear all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\r\nhad been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\r\nbed for several days.  During this interval, one of the servants,\r\nhappening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\r\nmurder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\r\nhad been judged to be the temptation of the murderer.  The servant\r\ninstantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\r\nany of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\r\nJustine was apprehended.  On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\r\nconfirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\r\nmanner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\r\nearnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer.  Justine, poor,\r\ngood Justine, is innocent.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt that instant my father entered.  I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\r\non his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\r\nafter we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\r\nsome other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\r\n“Good God, papa!  Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\r\npoor William.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\r\nrather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\r\ndepravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty.  She is to be\r\ntried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis speech calmed me.  I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\r\nJustine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder.  I\r\nhad no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\r\nbrought forward strong enough to convict her.  My tale was not one to\r\nannounce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\r\nmadness by the vulgar.  Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\r\ncreator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\r\nexistence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\r\nwhich I had let loose upon the world?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe were soon joined by Elizabeth.  Time had altered her since I last\r\nbeheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\r\nher childish years.  There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\r\nit was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\r\nShe welcomed me with the greatest affection.  “Your arrival, my dear\r\ncousin,” said she, “fills me with hope.  You perhaps will find some\r\nmeans to justify my poor guiltless Justine.  Alas! who is safe, if she\r\nbe convicted of crime?  I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\r\nupon my own.  Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\r\nlost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\r\nlove, is to be torn away by even a worse fate.  If she is condemned, I\r\nnever shall know joy more.  But she will not, I am sure she will not;\r\nand then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\r\nWilliam.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\r\nbe proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\r\nof her acquittal.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\r\nand that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible:  and to\r\nsee every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\r\nhopeless and despairing.”  She wept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\r\nis, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\r\nactivity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\r\npartiality.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap08\"></a>Chapter 8</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\r\ncommence.  My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\r\nas witnesses, I accompanied them to the court.  During the whole of\r\nthis wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture.  It was to\r\nbe decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\r\ncause the death of two of my fellow beings:  one a smiling babe full of\r\ninnocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\r\naggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\r\nJustine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\r\nto render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\r\nignominious grave, and I the cause!  A thousand times rather would I\r\nhave confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\r\nwas absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\r\nbeen considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\r\nexculpated her who suffered through me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe appearance of Justine was calm.  She was dressed in mourning, and\r\nher countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\r\nfeelings, exquisitely beautiful.  Yet she appeared confident in\r\ninnocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\r\nthousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\r\nexcited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\r\nimagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed.  She\r\nwas tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\r\nher confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\r\nworked up her mind to an appearance of courage.  When she entered the\r\ncourt she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\r\nseated.  A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\r\nrecovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\r\nher utter guiltlessness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\r\ncharge, several witnesses were called.  Several strange facts combined\r\nagainst her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\r\nof her innocence as I had.  She had been out the whole of the night on\r\nwhich the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\r\nperceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\r\nmurdered child had been afterwards found.  The woman asked her what she\r\ndid there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\r\nand unintelligible answer.  She returned to the house about eight\r\no’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\r\nreplied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\r\nif anything had been heard concerning him.  When shown the body, she\r\nfell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.  The\r\npicture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\r\nand when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\r\nwhich, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\r\nhis neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJustine was called on for her defence.  As the trial had proceeded, her\r\ncountenance had altered.  Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\r\nexpressed.  Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\r\ndesired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\r\nalthough variable voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\r\ndo not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\r\non a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\r\nagainst me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\r\njudges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\r\ndoubtful or suspicious.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\r\nthe evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\r\nhouse of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\r\nGeneva.  On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\r\nher if she had seen anything of the child who was lost.  She was\r\nalarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\r\nwhen the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\r\nseveral hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\r\nunwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known.  Most\r\nof the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\r\nshe slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\r\nIt was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\r\nto find my brother.  If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\r\nit was without her knowledge.  That she had been bewildered when\r\nquestioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\r\na sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\r\nConcerning the picture she could give no account.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\r\nfatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\r\nexplaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\r\nto conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\r\nplaced in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\r\nenemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\r\nwantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\r\nafforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\r\njewel, to part with it again so soon?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\r\nhope.  I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\r\ncharacter, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\r\nguilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\r\ninnocence.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\r\nthey spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\r\nsupposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\r\nforward.  Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\r\ndispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\r\nwhen, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\r\nthe court.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\r\nwas murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\r\nwith his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\r\ntherefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\r\nwhen I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\r\npretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\r\nknow of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\r\nin the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\r\ntwo years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\r\nbenevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\r\nher last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\r\nattended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\r\nthe admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\r\nuncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\r\nwarmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\r\nmost affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\r\nnotwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\r\non her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\r\nthe bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\r\nI should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\r\nher.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\r\nappeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\r\nfavour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\r\nrenewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude.  She\r\nherself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer.  My own\r\nagitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial.  I believed\r\nin her innocence; I knew it.  Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\r\nminute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\r\nbetrayed the innocent to death and ignominy?  I could not sustain the\r\nhorror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\r\nthe countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\r\nI rushed out of the court in agony.  The tortures of the accused did\r\nnot equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\r\nremorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI passed a night of unmingled wretchedness.  In the morning I went to\r\nthe court; my lips and throat were parched.  I dared not ask the fatal\r\nquestion, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\r\nvisit.  The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\r\nwas condemned.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot pretend to describe what I then felt.  I had before\r\nexperienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\r\nthem adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\r\nheart-sickening despair that I then endured.  The person to whom I\r\naddressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\r\n“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\r\ncase, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\r\ncondemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\r\ndecisive.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean?  Had\r\nmy eyes deceived me?  And was I really as mad as the whole world would\r\nbelieve me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions?  I\r\nhastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\r\njudges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\r\nshould escape.  But she has confessed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\r\nJustine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\r\never again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\r\nmy sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\r\nHer mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\r\ncommitted a murder.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSoon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\r\ncousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\r\njudgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\r\n“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\r\nme; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\r\nI could not refuse.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\r\nstraw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\r\nher knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\r\nher, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\r\ncousin wept also.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Justine!” said she.  “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\r\nI relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\r\nwas not so miserable as I am now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked?  Do you also\r\njoin with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\r\nvoice was suffocated with sobs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\r\nif you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\r\nguiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\r\nyourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\r\nassured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\r\nmoment, but your own confession.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I did confess, but I confessed a lie.  I confessed, that I might\r\nobtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\r\nall my other sins.  The God of heaven forgive me!  Ever since I was\r\ncondemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\r\nuntil I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\r\nwas.  He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\r\nI continued obdurate.  Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\r\non me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition.  What could I do?\r\nIn an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\r\nmiserable.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\r\nsweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\r\naunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\r\nof a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\r\nDear William! dearest blessed child!  I soon shall see you again in\r\nheaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\r\nam to suffer ignominy and death.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Justine!  Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\r\nWhy did you confess?  But do not mourn, dear girl.  Do not fear.  I\r\nwill proclaim, I will prove your innocence.  I will melt the stony\r\nhearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers.  You shall not die!\r\nYou, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\r\nNo!  No!  I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJustine shook her head mournfully.  “I do not fear to die,” she said;\r\n“that pang is past.  God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\r\nendure the worst.  I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\r\nme and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\r\nfate awaiting me.  Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\r\nthe will of heaven!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\r\nwhere I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me.  Despair!\r\nWho dared talk of that?  The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\r\nthe awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\r\ndeep and bitter agony.  I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\r\nuttering a groan that came from my inmost soul.  Justine started.  When\r\nshe saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\r\nkind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI could not answer.  “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\r\nconvinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\r\nhad confessed, he did not credit it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I truly thank him.  In these last moments I feel the sincerest\r\ngratitude towards those who think of me with kindness.  How sweet is\r\nthe affection of others to such a wretch as I am!  It removes more than\r\nhalf my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\r\ninnocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself.  She indeed\r\ngained the resignation she desired.  But I, the true murderer, felt the\r\nnever-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\r\nconsolation.  Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\r\nthe misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\r\nmoon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness.  Anguish and\r\ndespair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\r\nme which nothing could extinguish.  We stayed several hours with\r\nJustine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\r\nherself away.  “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\r\ncannot live in this world of misery.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJustine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\r\nrepressed her bitter tears.  She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\r\nof half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\r\nmy beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\r\npreserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\r\nsuffer!  Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd on the morrow Justine died.  Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\r\nfailed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\r\ncriminality of the saintly sufferer.  My passionate and indignant\r\nappeals were lost upon them.  And when I received their cold answers\r\nand heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\r\navowal died away on my lips.  Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\r\nbut not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim.  She\r\nperished on the scaffold as a murderess!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\r\nvoiceless grief of my Elizabeth.  This also was my doing!  And my\r\nfather’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\r\nthe work of my thrice-accursed hands!  Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\r\nare not your last tears!  Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\r\nthe sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\r\nFrankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\r\nwho would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\r\nthought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\r\ncountenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\r\nin serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\r\nhis hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\r\npause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\r\nI beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\r\nJustine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap09\"></a>Chapter 9</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nNothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\r\nbeen worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\r\ninaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\r\nand fear.  Justine died, she rested, and I was alive.  The blood flowed\r\nfreely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\r\nheart which nothing could remove.  Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\r\nlike an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\r\ndescription horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\r\nbehind.  Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\r\nI had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\r\nwhen I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\r\nbeings.  Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\r\nwhich allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\r\nfrom thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\r\nthe sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\r\nsuch as no language can describe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\r\nentirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained.  I shunned\r\nthe face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\r\nsolitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\r\nand habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\r\nserene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\r\nawaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\r\n“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\r\nalso? No one could love a child more than I loved your\r\nbrother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\r\nis it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\r\ntheir unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\r\nowed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\r\nor even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\r\nsociety.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\r\nshould have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\r\nremorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\r\nother sensations.  Now I could only answer my father with a look of\r\ndespair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout this time we retired to our house at Belrive.  This change was\r\nparticularly agreeable to me.  The shutting of the gates regularly at\r\nten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\r\nhour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\r\nto me.  I was now free.  Often, after the rest of the family had\r\nretired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\r\nwater.  Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\r\nsometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\r\npursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections.  I\r\nwas often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\r\nunquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\r\nheavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\r\ninterrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\r\nI say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\r\nmight close over me and my calamities for ever.  But I was restrained,\r\nwhen I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\r\nloved, and whose existence was bound up in mine.  I thought also of my\r\nfather and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\r\nexposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\r\namong them?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\r\nmind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\r\ncould not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\r\nunalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\r\ncreated should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\r\nthat all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\r\nwhich by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\r\nThere was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\r\nbehind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\r\nhim I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\r\nextinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\r\nreflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\r\nof moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\r\nAndes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\r\nto see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\r\nhead and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\r\nshaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\r\ndesponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\r\npleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\r\nthen thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\r\nand destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\r\nwandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\r\nfuture prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\r\nthe earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\r\nsmiles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\r\nJustine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\r\nappeared to me.  Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\r\ninjustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\r\ndays or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\r\nreason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\r\nappear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood.  Yet I am\r\ncertainly unjust.  Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\r\nif she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\r\nshe would have been the most depraved of human creatures.  For the sake\r\nof a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\r\na child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\r\nit had been her own!  I could not consent to the death of any human\r\nbeing, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\r\nremain in the society of men.  But she was innocent.  I know, I feel\r\nshe was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\r\nAlas!  Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\r\nassure themselves of certain happiness?  I feel as if I were walking on\r\nthe edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\r\nendeavouring to plunge me into the abyss.  William and Justine were\r\nassassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\r\nand perhaps respected.  But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\r\nscaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\r\nwretch.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI listened to this discourse with the extremest agony.  I, not in deed,\r\nbut in effect, was the true murderer.  Elizabeth read my anguish in my\r\ncountenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you\r\nmust calm yourself.  These events have affected me, God knows how\r\ndeeply; but I am not so wretched as you are.  There is an expression of\r\ndespair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\r\ntremble.  Dear Victor, banish these dark passions.  Remember the\r\nfriends around you, who centre all their hopes in you.  Have we lost\r\nthe power of rendering you happy?  Ah!  While we love, while we are\r\ntrue to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\r\ncountry, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our\r\npeace?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\r\nother gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\r\nheart?  Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\r\nthat very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\r\nheaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\r\nineffectual.  I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\r\ninfluence could penetrate.  The wounded deer dragging its fainting\r\nlimbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\r\npierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\r\nsometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\r\nexercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\r\nsensations.  It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\r\nmy home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\r\nin the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\r\nmy ephemeral, because human, sorrows.  My wanderings were directed\r\ntowards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my\r\nboyhood.  Six years had passed since then: <i>I</i> was a wreck, but nought\r\nhad changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI performed the first part of my journey on horseback.  I afterwards\r\nhired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\r\ninjury on these rugged roads.  The weather was fine; it was about the\r\nmiddle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\r\nJustine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.  The\r\nweight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\r\nthe ravine of Arve.  The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\r\nme on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\r\nthe dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\r\nOmnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\r\nalmighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\r\ndisplayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,\r\nthe valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\r\nRuined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\r\nimpetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\r\namong the trees formed a scene of singular beauty.  But it was\r\naugmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\r\nshining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\r\nearth, the habitations of another race of beings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\r\nforms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\r\noverhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.  This\r\nvalley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\r\npicturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.  The\r\nhigh and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\r\nmore ruined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached\r\nthe road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\r\nmarked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and\r\nmagnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding <i>aiguilles</i>,\r\nand its tremendous <i>dôme</i> overlooked the valley.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\r\njourney.  Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\r\nrecognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\r\nlighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The very winds whispered in soothing\r\naccents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the\r\nkindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\r\nand indulging in all the misery of reflection.  Then I spurred on my\r\nanimal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\r\nmyself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\r\nthe grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded\r\nto the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\r\nFor a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\r\nlightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\r\nthe Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds\r\nacted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\r\nupon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\r\nthe giver of oblivion.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap10\"></a>Chapter 10</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nI spent the following day roaming through the valley.  I stood beside\r\nthe sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\r\nwith slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\r\nbarricade the valley.  The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\r\nme; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\r\nscattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\r\npresence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\r\nwaves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\r\navalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\r\naccumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\r\nwas ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\r\ntheir hands.  These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\r\ngreatest consolation that I was capable of receiving.  They elevated me\r\nfrom all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\r\ngrief, they subdued and tranquillised it.  In some degree, also, they\r\ndiverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\r\nlast month.  I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\r\nwaited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\r\nhad contemplated during the day.  They congregated round me; the\r\nunstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\r\nand ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\r\ngathered round me and bade me be at peace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhere had they fled when the next morning I awoke?  All of\r\nsoul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\r\nthought.  The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\r\nsummits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\r\nmighty friends.  Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\r\nin their cloudy retreats.  What were rain and storm to me?  My mule was\r\nbrought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\r\nMontanvert.  I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\r\nand ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\r\nIt had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\r\nsoul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\r\nThe sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\r\neffect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\r\ncares of life.  I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\r\nacquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\r\nsolitary grandeur of the scene.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\r\nwindings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\r\nmountain.  It is a scene terrifically desolate.  In a thousand spots\r\nthe traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\r\nbroken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\r\nleaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\r\nother trees.  The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\r\nof snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\r\nparticularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\r\nin a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\r\ndestruction upon the head of the speaker.  The pines are not tall or\r\nluxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\r\nI looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\r\nwhich ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\r\nmountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\r\npoured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\r\nreceived from the objects around me.  Alas!  Why does man boast of\r\nsensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\r\nthem more necessary beings.  If our impulses were confined to hunger,\r\nthirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\r\nevery wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\r\nconvey to us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.<br>\r\n       We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.<br>\r\n  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,<br>\r\n       Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;<br>\r\n  It is the same:  for, be it joy or sorrow,<br>\r\n       The path of its departure still is free.<br>\r\n  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;<br>\r\n       Nought may endure but mutability!<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent.  For some\r\ntime I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice.  A mist covered\r\nboth that and the surrounding mountains.  Presently a breeze dissipated\r\nthe cloud, and I descended upon the glacier.  The surface is very\r\nuneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\r\ninterspersed by rifts that sink deep.  The field of ice is almost a\r\nleague in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it.  The\r\nopposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock.  From the side where I\r\nnow stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\r\nand above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty.  I remained in a recess\r\nof the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene.  The sea,\r\nor rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\r\nwhose aerial summits hung over its recesses.  Their icy and glittering\r\npeaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds.  My heart, which was\r\nbefore sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\r\n“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\r\nbeds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\r\naway from the joys of life.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\r\nadvancing towards me with superhuman speed.  He bounded over the\r\ncrevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\r\nstature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man.  I was\r\ntroubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\r\nbut I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains.  I\r\nperceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\r\nthat it was the wretch whom I had created.  I trembled with rage and\r\nhorror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\r\nmortal combat.  He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\r\ncombined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\r\nrendered it almost too horrible for human eyes.  But I scarcely\r\nobserved this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\r\nand I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\r\ndetestation and contempt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do\r\nnot you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\r\nBegone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\r\noh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\r\nthose victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon.  “All men hate the\r\nwretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\r\nliving things!  Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\r\nto whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\r\none of us.  You purpose to kill me.  How dare you sport thus with life?\r\nDo your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\r\nmankind.  If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\r\nyou at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\r\nbe satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Abhorred monster!  Fiend that thou art!  The tortures of hell are too\r\nmild a vengeance for thy crimes.  Wretched devil!  You reproach me with\r\nyour creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\r\nso negligently bestowed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\r\nfeelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe easily eluded me and said,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Be calm!  I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\r\non my devoted head.  Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\r\nincrease my misery?  Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\r\nanguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.  Remember, thou hast made\r\nme more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\r\njoints more supple.  But I will not be tempted to set myself in\r\nopposition to thee.  I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\r\ndocile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\r\nthe which thou owest me.  Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\r\nother and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\r\nclemency and affection, is most due.  Remember that I am thy creature;\r\nI ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\r\ndrivest from joy for no misdeed.  Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\r\nalone am irrevocably excluded.  I was benevolent and good; misery made\r\nme a fiend.  Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Begone!  I will not hear you.  There can be no community between you\r\nand me; we are enemies.  Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\r\nin which one must fall.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How can I move thee?  Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\r\nfavourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\r\ncompassion?  Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\r\nwith love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone?  You, my\r\ncreator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\r\nwho owe me nothing?  They spurn and hate me.  The desert mountains and\r\ndreary glaciers are my refuge.  I have wandered here many days; the\r\ncaves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\r\nonly one which man does not grudge.  These bleak skies I hail, for they\r\nare kinder to me than your fellow beings.  If the multitude of mankind\r\nknew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\r\nmy destruction.  Shall I not then hate them who abhor me?  I will keep\r\nno terms with my enemies.  I am miserable, and they shall share my\r\nwretchedness.  Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\r\nthem from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\r\nnot only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\r\nswallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage.  Let your compassion be\r\nmoved, and do not disdain me.  Listen to my tale; when you have heard\r\nthat, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\r\nBut hear me.  The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\r\nare, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned.  Listen\r\nto me, Frankenstein.  You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\r\na satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature.  Oh, praise the\r\neternal justice of man!  Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\r\nand then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\r\nwhich I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\r\nauthor?  Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\r\nlight!  Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\r\nYou have made me wretched beyond expression.  You have left me no power\r\nto consider whether I am just to you or not.  Begone!  Relieve me from\r\nthe sight of your detested form.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\r\nbefore my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\r\nthee a sight which you abhor.  Still thou canst listen to me and grant\r\nme thy compassion.  By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\r\nfrom you.  Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\r\nthis place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\r\nthe mountain.  The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\r\nto hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\r\nworld, you will have heard my story and can decide.  On you it rests,\r\nwhether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\r\nlife, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\r\nyour own speedy ruin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed.  My heart\r\nwas full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\r\nvarious arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\r\nhis tale.  I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\r\nresolution.  I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\r\nbrother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\r\nFor the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\r\nhis creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\r\ncomplained of his wickedness.  These motives urged me to comply with\r\nhis demand.  We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\r\nrock.  The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\r\nentered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\r\nheart and depressed spirits.  But I consented to listen, and seating\r\nmyself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\r\nhis tale.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap11\"></a>Chapter 11</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\r\nmy being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\r\nA strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\r\nand smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\r\nlearned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses.  By\r\ndegrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\r\nwas obliged to shut my eyes.  Darkness then came over me and troubled\r\nme, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\r\nsuppose, the light poured in upon me again.  I walked and, I believe,\r\ndescended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\r\nBefore, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\r\ntouch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\r\nno obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid.  The light\r\nbecame more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\r\nwalked, I sought a place where I could receive shade.  This was the\r\nforest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\r\nfrom my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.  This\r\nroused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\r\nfound hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.  I slaked my thirst\r\nat the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\r\nwere, instinctively, finding myself so desolate.  Before I had quitted\r\nyour apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\r\nclothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\r\nnight.  I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\r\ndistinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\r\ndown and wept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\r\npleasure.  I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\r\ntrees.  [The moon]  I gazed with a kind of wonder.  It moved slowly,\r\nbut it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\r\nI was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\r\nwhich I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground.  No distinct\r\nideas occupied my mind; all was confused.  I felt light, and hunger,\r\nand thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\r\nall sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\r\ndistinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\r\npleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\r\ngreatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\r\nother.  I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\r\ndrink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.  I was delighted\r\nwhen I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\r\nears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\r\noften intercepted the light from my eyes.  I began also to observe,\r\nwith greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\r\nboundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.  Sometimes I\r\ntried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\r\nSometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\r\nuncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\r\nsilence again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\r\nform, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest.  My\r\nsensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\r\nday additional ideas.  My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\r\nperceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\r\nthe herb, and by degrees, one herb from another.  I found that the\r\nsparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\r\nthrush were sweet and enticing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\r\nleft by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\r\nwarmth I experienced from it.  In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\r\nembers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.  How strange,\r\nI thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects!  I\r\nexamined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\r\ncomposed of wood.  I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\r\nand would not burn.  I was pained at this and sat still watching the\r\noperation of the fire.  The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\r\ndried and itself became inflamed.  I reflected on this, and by touching\r\nthe various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\r\ncollecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\r\nplentiful supply of fire.  When night came on and brought sleep with\r\nit, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.  I\r\ncovered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\r\nupon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\r\ninto sleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\r\nI uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.  I\r\nobserved this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\r\nembers when they were nearly extinguished.  When night came again I\r\nfound, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\r\nthe discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\r\nsome of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\r\ntasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.  I\r\ntried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\r\nthe live embers.  I found that the berries were spoiled by this\r\noperation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\r\nsearching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\r\nI found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\r\ninhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\r\nmore easily satisfied.  In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\r\nloss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\r\nto reproduce it.  I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\r\nthis difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\r\nit, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\r\ntowards the setting sun.  I passed three days in these rambles and at\r\nlength discovered the open country.  A great fall of snow had taken\r\nplace the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\r\nappearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\r\ndamp substance that covered the ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\r\nshelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\r\nhad doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.  This\r\nwas a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\r\ncuriosity.  Finding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it,\r\nnear a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.  He turned on\r\nhearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\r\nhut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\r\nhardly appeared capable.  His appearance, different from any I had ever\r\nbefore seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted\r\nby the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\r\npenetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\r\nand divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\r\nafter their sufferings in the lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the\r\nremnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\r\nmilk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overcome by\r\nfatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\r\nshone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\r\ntravels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\r\nwallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\r\nat sunset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous did this appear!  The\r\nhuts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\r\nturns.  The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\r\nplaced at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\r\nof the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\r\nthe door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\r\nThe whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\r\ngrievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\r\nescaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\r\nquite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\r\nbeheld in the village.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\r\nand pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\r\ndared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\r\nlow that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.  No wood, however,\r\nwas placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\r\nalthough the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\r\nagreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\r\nhowever miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\r\nfrom the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\r\nkennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\r\nremain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back\r\nof the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\r\nsty and a clear pool of water.  One part was open, and by that I had\r\ncrept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\r\nwith stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\r\noccasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\r\nthat was sufficient for me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\r\nretired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\r\ntoo well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.  I\r\nhad first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\r\nof coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\r\nmore conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\r\nmy retreat.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\r\nperfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\r\ntolerably warm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\r\nsomething should occur which might alter my determination.  It was\r\nindeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\r\nthe rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with\r\npleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\r\nwater when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\r\na young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\r\ngirl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\r\ncottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dressed, a\r\ncoarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\r\nhair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost\r\nsight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\r\nthe pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,\r\nseemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\r\ncountenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Uttering a few sounds with\r\nan air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\r\ncottage himself.  She followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I saw\r\nthe young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\r\nbehind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\r\nhouse and sometimes in the yard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\r\ncottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\r\nfilled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\r\nimperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\r\nThrough this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\r\nbut very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\r\nold man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\r\nyoung girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\r\ntook something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\r\ndown beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\r\nand to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\r\nnightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\r\nnever beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\r\ncountenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\r\nmanners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\r\nwhich I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\r\nwhich the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\r\npronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\r\nat his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\r\nthat I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\r\na mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\r\neither from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\r\nwindow, unable to bear these emotions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\r\nload of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\r\nhis burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\r\nthe fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\r\nand he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed\r\npleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\r\nplaced in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her\r\nwork, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\r\nemployed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed\r\nthus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\r\ncottage together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\r\nof his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\r\neat.  The meal was quickly dispatched.  The young woman was again\r\noccupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\r\ncottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\r\nNothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\r\ncreatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\r\nwith benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\r\nfigure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\r\neyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The\r\nold man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\r\nfrom those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\r\nfields.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\r\ncottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\r\ndelighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\r\npleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.  In the evening\r\nthe young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\r\nwhich I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\r\ninstrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\r\nthe morning.  So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\r\nbut to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\r\nharmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\r\nfound that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\r\nscience of words or letters.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\r\nextinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap12\"></a>Chapter 12</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep.  I thought of the\r\noccurrences of the day.  What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\r\nof these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not.  I\r\nremembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\r\nthe barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\r\nmight hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\r\nremain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\r\nmotives which influenced their actions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.  The young woman\r\narranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\r\nafter the first meal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\r\nThe young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\r\nvarious laborious occupations within.  The old man, whom I soon\r\nperceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\r\nin contemplation.  Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\r\nyounger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.  They\r\nperformed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\r\ngentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They were not entirely happy.  The young man and his companion often\r\nwent apart and appeared to weep.  I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\r\nbut I was deeply affected by it.  If such lovely creatures were\r\nmiserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\r\nshould be wretched.  Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy?  They\r\npossessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\r\nluxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\r\nwhen hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\r\nthey enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\r\nlooks of affection and kindness.  What did their tears imply?  Did they\r\nreally express pain?  I was at first unable to solve these questions,\r\nbut perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\r\nwere at first enigmatic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\r\nthe uneasiness of this amiable family:  it was poverty, and they\r\nsuffered that evil in a very distressing degree.  Their nourishment\r\nconsisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\r\none cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\r\ncould scarcely procure food to support it.  They often, I believe,\r\nsuffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\r\nyounger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\r\nman when they reserved none for themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly.  I had been accustomed,\r\nduring the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\r\nconsumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\r\nthe cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\r\nroots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\r\ntheir labours.  I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\r\nin collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\r\ntook his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\r\nfiring sufficient for the consumption of several days.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\r\nopened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\r\npile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\r\nyouth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\r\nthat he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\r\ncottage and cultivating the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\r\nthese people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\r\nfeelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\r\nthey spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\r\nminds and countenances of the hearers.  This was indeed a godlike science,\r\nand I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\r\nevery attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\r\nthe words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\r\nobjects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\r\nmystery of their reference.  By great application, however, and after having\r\nremained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\r\ndiscovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\r\ndiscourse; I learned and applied the words, <i>fire, milk, bread,</i> and\r\n<i>wood.</i> I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\r\nand his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\r\none, which was <i>father.</i> The girl was called <i>sister</i> or\r\n<i>Agatha,</i> and the youth <i>Felix, brother,</i> or <i>son</i>. I cannot\r\ndescribe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\r\nthese sounds and was able to pronounce them.  I distinguished several other\r\nwords without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as <i>good,\r\ndearest, unhappy.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I spent the winter in this manner.  The gentle manners and beauty of\r\nthe cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\r\nfelt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys.  I saw\r\nfew human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\r\ncottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\r\nsuperior accomplishments of my friends.  The old man, I could perceive,\r\noften endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\r\nhe called them, to cast off their melancholy.  He would talk in a\r\ncheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\r\neven upon me.  Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\r\nwith tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\r\ngenerally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\r\nhaving listened to the exhortations of her father.  It was not thus\r\nwith Felix.  He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\r\nunpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\r\nfriends.  But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\r\ncheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\r\nman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\r\nthe dispositions of these amiable cottagers.  In the midst of poverty\r\nand want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\r\nwhite flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.  Early in\r\nthe morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\r\nobstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\r\nbrought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\r\nastonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\r\nhand.  In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\r\nfarmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\r\nyet brought no wood with him.  At other times he worked in the garden,\r\nbut as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\r\nman and Agatha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\r\ndiscovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\r\nhe talked.  I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\r\nfor speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\r\nthese also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\r\nthe sounds for which they stood as signs?  I improved, however,\r\nsensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\r\nconversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\r\neasily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\r\nthe cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\r\nmaster of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\r\noverlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\r\nperpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,\r\nand delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\r\nin a transparent pool!  At first I started back, unable to believe that\r\nit was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\r\nfully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\r\nfilled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\r\nAlas!  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\r\ndeformity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\r\nvanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.  From this\r\ntime Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\r\nimpending famine disappeared.  Their food, as I afterwards found, was\r\ncoarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\r\nSeveral new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\r\ndressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\r\nadvanced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\r\nnot rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\r\nwaters.  This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\r\nearth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform.  During the morning I\r\nattended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\r\nvarious occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\r\nobserving my friends.  When they had retired to rest, if there was any\r\nmoon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\r\nmy own food and fuel for the cottage.  When I returned, as often as it\r\nwas necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\r\noffices that I had seen done by Felix.  I afterwards found that these\r\nlabours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\r\nonce or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words <i>good\r\nspirit, wonderful</i>; but I did not then understand the signification\r\nof these terms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\r\nmotives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\r\nknow why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.  I thought\r\n(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\r\nthese deserving people.  When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\r\nvenerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\r\nflitted before me.  I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\r\nthe arbiters of my future destiny.  I formed in my imagination a\r\nthousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\r\nme.  I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\r\ndemeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\r\nafterwards their love.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\r\nthe acquiring the art of language.  My organs were indeed harsh, but\r\nsupple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\r\ntones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\r\nIt was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\r\nintentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\r\nbetter treatment than blows and execration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\r\naspect of the earth.  Men who before this change seemed to have been\r\nhid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\r\ncultivation.  The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\r\nbegan to bud forth on the trees.  Happy, happy earth!  Fit habitation\r\nfor gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\r\nunwholesome.  My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\r\nnature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\r\nand the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap13\"></a>Chapter 13</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story.  I shall relate\r\nevents that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\r\nhave made me what I am.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\r\ncloudless.  It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\r\nshould now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure.  My\r\nsenses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\r\na thousand sights of beauty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\r\nfrom labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\r\nlistened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\r\nmelancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\r\npaused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\r\nthe cause of his son’s sorrow.  Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\r\nthe old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\r\nThe lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\r\nveil.  Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\r\npronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix.  Her voice was\r\nmusical but unlike that of either of my friends.  On hearing this word,\r\nFelix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\r\nveil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.  Her\r\nhair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\r\ndark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\r\nproportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\r\na lovely pink.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\r\nsorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\r\necstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\r\neyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\r\nthought him as beautiful as the stranger.  She appeared affected by\r\ndifferent feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\r\nout her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\r\nwell as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian.  She did not appear to\r\nunderstand him, but smiled.  He assisted her to dismount, and\r\ndismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage.  Some\r\nconversation took place between him and his father, and the young\r\nstranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\r\nbut he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\r\nand appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\r\nby nor herself understood the cottagers.  They made many signs which I\r\ndid not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\r\nthrough the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\r\nmorning mists.  Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\r\ndelight welcomed his Arabian.  Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\r\nthe hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\r\nsigns which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\r\ncame.  Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\r\nexpressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend.  Presently I\r\nfound, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\r\nrepeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\r\nand the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\r\nsame instructions to the same end.  The stranger learned about twenty\r\nwords at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\r\nbefore understood, but I profited by the others.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early.  When they\r\nseparated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\r\nsweet Safie.’  He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\r\nby the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\r\nguest was the subject of their conversation.  I ardently desired to\r\nunderstand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\r\nit utterly impossible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\r\noccupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\r\nold man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\r\nbeautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\r\neyes.  She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\r\ndying away like a nightingale of the woods.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\r\ndeclined it.  She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\r\nsweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger.  The old\r\nman appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\r\nexplain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\r\nbestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\r\nthat joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\r\nSafie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\r\nknowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\r\nof the words uttered by my protectors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\r\nthe green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\r\nscent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\r\nthe sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\r\nrambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\r\nshortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\r\nventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\r\ntreatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\r\nmaster the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\r\nthe Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\r\naccents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\r\nwas spoken.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\r\nit was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\r\nfor wonder and delight.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s <i>Ruins\r\nof Empires</i>. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\r\nFelix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\r\nwork, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\r\nEastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\r\nand a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\r\nme an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\r\nnations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\r\ngenius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\r\nof the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\r\ndecline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\r\nof the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\r\nhapless fate of its original inhabitants.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings.  Was\r\nman, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\r\nvicious and base?  He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\r\nprinciple and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\r\ngodlike.  To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\r\nthat can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\r\nrecord have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\r\nabject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm.  For a long time I\r\ncould not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\r\neven why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\r\nvice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\r\nloathing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\r\nWhile I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\r\nArabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me.  I\r\nheard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\r\npoverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The words induced me to turn towards myself.  I learned that the\r\npossessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\r\nunsullied descent united with riches.  A man might be respected with\r\nonly one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\r\nexcept in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\r\nwaste his powers for the profits of the chosen few!  And what was I? Of\r\nmy creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\r\npossessed no money, no friends, no kind of property.  I was, besides,\r\nendued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\r\nof the same nature as man.  I was more agile than they and could\r\nsubsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\r\nless injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.  When I looked\r\naround I saw and heard of none like me.  Was I, then, a monster, a blot\r\nupon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\r\nupon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\r\nknowledge.  Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\r\nknown nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of what a strange nature is knowledge!  It clings to the mind when it\r\nhas once seized on it like a lichen on the rock.  I wished sometimes to\r\nshake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\r\nmeans to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\r\nwhich I feared yet did not understand.  I admired virtue and good\r\nfeelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\r\ncottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\r\nthrough means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\r\nunknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\r\nbecoming one among my fellows.  The gentle words of Agatha and  the\r\nanimated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me.  The mild\r\nexhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\r\nFelix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply.  I heard of the\r\ndifference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\r\nfather doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\r\nolder child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\r\nin the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\r\nknowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\r\nbind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But where were my friends and relations?  No father had watched my\r\ninfant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\r\nthey had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\r\ndistinguished nothing.  From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\r\nthen was in height and proportion.  I had never yet seen a being\r\nresembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me.  What was I?  The\r\nquestion again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\r\nreturn to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\r\nfeelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\r\nin additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\r\nan innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap14\"></a>Chapter 14</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends.  It was\r\none which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\r\nas it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\r\none so utterly inexperienced as I was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The name of the old man was De Lacey.  He was descended from a good\r\nfamily in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\r\nrespected by his superiors and beloved by his equals.  His son was bred\r\nin the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\r\nhighest distinction.  A few months before my arrival they had lived in\r\na large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\r\npossessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\r\ntaste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin.  He was a\r\nTurkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\r\nreason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\r\nHe was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\r\nConstantinople to join him.  He was tried and condemned to death.  The\r\ninjustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\r\nand it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\r\nalleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\r\nindignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\r\ncourt.  He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\r\nlooked around for the means.  After many fruitless attempts to gain\r\nadmittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\r\nunguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\r\nunfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\r\nexecution of the barbarous sentence.  Felix visited the grate at night\r\nand made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour.  The Turk,\r\namazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\r\nby promises of reward and wealth.  Felix rejected his offers with\r\ncontempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\r\nher father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\r\nyouth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\r\na treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\r\non the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\r\nhis interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\r\nshould be conveyed to a place of safety.  Felix was too delicate to\r\naccept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\r\nevent as to the consummation of his happiness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\r\nthe escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\r\nletters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\r\nexpress her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\r\nman, a servant of her father who understood French.  She thanked him in\r\nthe most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\r\nat the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\r\nin the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\r\nwere often in the hands of Felix or Agatha.  Before I depart I will\r\ngive them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\r\nas the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\r\nthe substance of them to you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\r\nslave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\r\nthe father of Safie, who married her.  The young girl spoke in high and\r\nenthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\r\nbondage to which she was now reduced.  She instructed her daughter in\r\nthe tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\r\nintellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\r\nfollowers of Muhammad.  This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\r\nimpressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\r\nreturning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\r\nallowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\r\nthe temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\r\nemulation for virtue.  The prospect of marrying a Christian and\r\nremaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\r\nsociety was enchanting to her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\r\nprevious to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\r\nmany leagues from Paris.  Felix had procured passports in the name of\r\nhis father, sister, and himself.  He had previously communicated his\r\nplan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\r\nthe pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\r\nan obscure part of Paris.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\r\nCenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\r\nopportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\r\ndeparture, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\r\nshould be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\r\nexpectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\r\nof the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\r\naffection.  They conversed with one another through the means of an\r\ninterpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\r\nsang to him the divine airs of her native country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\r\nof the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\r\nplans.  He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\r\nChristian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\r\nlukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\r\nif he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\r\ninhabited.  He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\r\nto prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\r\nsecretly to take his daughter with him when he departed.  His plans\r\nwere facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\r\nvictim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer.  The\r\nplot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\r\nthrown into prison.  The news reached Felix and roused him from his\r\ndream of pleasure.  His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\r\nin a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\r\nher whom he loved.  This idea was torture to him.  He quickly arranged\r\nwith the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\r\nfor escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\r\nboarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\r\nhe hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\r\nlaw, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He did not succeed.  They remained confined for five months before the\r\ntrial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\r\nand condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\r\ndiscovered them.  Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\r\nwhom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\r\ndiscovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\r\nbecame a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\r\nhis daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\r\nas he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\r\nhim, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family.  He could\r\nhave endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\r\nvirtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\r\nof his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable.  The\r\narrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\r\nand rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\r\nlover, but to prepare to return to her native country.  The generous\r\nnature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\r\nexpostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\r\ntyrannical mandate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\r\nher hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\r\nhad been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\r\nFrench government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\r\nConstantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours.  He\r\nintended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\r\nservant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\r\nproperty, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\r\nwould become her to pursue in this emergency.  A residence in Turkey\r\nwas abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\r\nto it.  By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\r\nheard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\r\nhe then resided.  She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\r\ndetermination.  Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\r\nsum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\r\nbut who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\r\nGermany.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\r\nof De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill.  Safie nursed her\r\nwith the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\r\nArabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\r\nand utterly ignorant of the customs of the world.  She fell, however,\r\ninto good hands.  The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\r\nwhich they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\r\nwhich they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\r\nthe cottage of her lover.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap15\"></a>Chapter 15</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers.  It impressed me deeply.\r\nI learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\r\ntheir virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\r\ngenerosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\r\nbecome an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\r\nwere called forth and displayed.  But in giving an account of the\r\nprogress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\r\nin the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\r\ncollected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\r\nthe ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\r\nsome books.  I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.\r\nFortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\r\nhad acquired at the cottage; they consisted of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, a volume\r\nof <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i>, and the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>. The\r\npossession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\r\nstudied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\r\nemployed in their ordinary occupations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books.  They produced\r\nin me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\r\nto ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection.  In\r\nthe <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\r\nstory, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\r\nwhat had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\r\nnever-ending source of speculation and astonishment.  The gentle and\r\ndomestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\r\nfeelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\r\nwell with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\r\nwere for ever alive in my own bosom.  But I thought Werter himself a\r\nmore divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\r\ncontained no pretension, but it sank deep.  The disquisitions upon\r\ndeath and suicide were calculated to fill  me with wonder.  I did not\r\npretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\r\nthe opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\r\nunderstanding it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\r\ncondition.  I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\r\nunlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\r\nwas a listener.  I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\r\nwas unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\r\n‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\r\nannihilation.  My person was hideous and my stature gigantic.  What did\r\nthis mean?  Who was I?  What was I?  Whence did I come?  What was my\r\ndestination?  These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\r\nsolve them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The volume of <i>Plutarch’s Lives</i> which I possessed contained the\r\nhistories of the first founders of the ancient republics.  This book\r\nhad a far different effect upon me from the <i>Sorrows of Werter</i>.  I\r\nlearned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\r\ntaught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\r\nown reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages.  Many\r\nthings I read surpassed my understanding and experience.  I had a very\r\nconfused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\r\nand boundless seas.  But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\r\nlarge assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\r\nonly school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\r\ndeveloped new and mightier scenes of action.  I read of men concerned\r\nin public affairs, governing or massacring their species.  I felt the\r\ngreatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\r\nfar as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\r\nwere, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone.  Induced by these\r\nfeelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\r\nSolon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus.  The\r\npatriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\r\nfirm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\r\nbeen made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\r\nhave been imbued with different sensations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But <i>Paradise Lost</i> excited different and far deeper emotions.  I read\r\nit, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\r\na true history.  It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\r\npicture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\r\nexciting.  I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\r\nstruck me, to my own.  Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\r\nany other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\r\nin every other respect.  He had come forth from the hands of God a\r\nperfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\r\nhis Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\r\nbeings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\r\nMany times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\r\noften, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\r\ngall of envy rose within me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings.  Soon\r\nafter my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\r\nthe dress which I had taken from your laboratory.  At first I had\r\nneglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\r\nwhich they were written, I began to study them with diligence.  It was\r\nyour journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You\r\nminutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\r\nof your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\r\noccurrences.  You doubtless recollect these papers.  Here they are.\r\nEverything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\r\norigin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\r\nwhich produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\r\nand loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\r\nhorrors and rendered mine indelible.  I sickened as I read.  ‘Hateful\r\nday when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony.  ‘Accursed creator!\r\nWhy did you form a monster so hideous that even <i>you</i> turned from me in\r\ndisgust?  God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\r\nimage; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\r\nvery resemblance.  Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\r\nand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\r\nbut when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\r\nbenevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\r\nbecome acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they  would\r\ncompassionate me and overlook my personal deformity.  Could they turn\r\nfrom their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\r\nand friendship?  I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\r\nto fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I\r\npostponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\r\nattached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\r\nBesides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\r\nday’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\r\nuntil a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage.  The\r\npresence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\r\nfound that a greater degree of plenty reigned there.  Felix and Agatha\r\nspent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\r\ntheir labours by servants.  They did not appear rich, but they were\r\ncontented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\r\nmine became every day more tumultuous.  Increase of knowledge only\r\ndiscovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.  I\r\ncherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\r\nreflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\r\nimage and that inconstant shade.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\r\nwhich in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\r\nthoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\r\ndared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\r\nfeelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\r\nsmiles of consolation.  But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\r\nsorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone.  I remembered Adam’s\r\nsupplication to his Creator.  But where was mine?  He had abandoned me,\r\nand in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Autumn passed thus.  I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\r\nand fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\r\nhad worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon.  Yet I did\r\nnot heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\r\nconformation for the endurance of cold than heat.  But my chief\r\ndelights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\r\napparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\r\ntowards the cottagers.  Their happiness was not decreased by the\r\nabsence of summer.  They loved and sympathised with one another; and\r\ntheir joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\r\ncasualties that took place around them.  The more I saw of them, the\r\ngreater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\r\nheart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\r\ntheir sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\r\nlimit of my ambition.  I dared not think that they would turn them from\r\nme with disdain and horror.  The poor that stopped at their door were\r\nnever driven away.  I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\r\nlittle food or rest:  I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\r\nbelieve myself utterly unworthy of it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\r\nplace since I awoke into life.  My attention at this time was solely\r\ndirected towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\r\nprotectors.  I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\r\nfixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\r\nI had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\r\nperson was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\r\nbeheld me.  My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\r\nthought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\r\nthe good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\r\nbe tolerated by my younger protectors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\r\nand diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\r\nand Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\r\ndesire, was left alone in the cottage.  When his children had departed,\r\nhe took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\r\nsweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before.  At first his\r\ncountenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\r\nthoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\r\ninstrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\r\nwould decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\r\nneighbouring fair.  All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\r\nexcellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\r\nlimbs failed me and I sank to the ground.  Again I rose, and exerting\r\nall the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\r\nplaced before my hovel to conceal my retreat.  The fresh air revived\r\nme, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\r\ncottage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am\r\na traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\r\nwould allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what\r\nmanner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\r\nfrom home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\r\nprocure food for you.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\r\nwarmth and rest only that I need.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I sat down, and a silence ensued.  I knew that every minute was\r\nprecious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\r\nthe interview, when the old man addressed me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\r\nFrench?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\r\nlanguage only.  I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\r\nwhom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Are they Germans?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘No, they are French.  But let us change the subject.  I am an\r\nunfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\r\nor friend upon earth.  These amiable people to whom I go have never\r\nseen me and know little of me.  I am full of fears, for if I fail\r\nthere, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\r\nthe hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\r\nfull of brotherly love and charity.  Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\r\nand if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\r\nbut, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me.  I have good\r\ndispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\r\nbeneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\r\nought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\r\nmonster.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\r\nyou undeceive them?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\r\nfeel so many overwhelming terrors.  I tenderly love these friends; I\r\nhave, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\r\nkindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\r\nit is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Where do these friends reside?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Near this spot.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly\r\nconfide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\r\nundeceiving them.  I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\r\nthere is something in your words which persuades me that you are\r\nsincere.  I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\r\nto be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Excellent man!  I thank you and accept your generous offer.  You\r\nraise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\r\nI shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\r\ncreatures.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Heaven forbid!  Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\r\ndrive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.  I also am\r\nunfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\r\njudge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor?  From your lips\r\nfirst have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\r\nbe for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\r\nwith those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\r\nrob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever.  I struggled vainly for\r\nfirmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\r\nremaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud.  At that\r\nmoment I heard the steps of my younger protectors.  I had not a moment\r\nto lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\r\ntime!  Save and protect me!  You and your family are the friends whom I\r\nseek.  Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man.  ‘Who are you?’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\r\nAgatha entered.  Who can describe their horror and consternation on\r\nbeholding me?  Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\r\nfriend, rushed out of the cottage.  Felix darted forward, and with\r\nsupernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\r\na transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\r\nwith a stick.  I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\r\nthe antelope.  But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\r\nI refrained.  I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\r\novercome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\r\ntumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap16\"></a>Chapter 16</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“Cursed, cursed creator!  Why did I live?  Why, in that instant, did I\r\nnot extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\r\nbestowed?  I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\r\nfeelings were those of rage and revenge.  I could with pleasure have\r\ndestroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\r\ntheir shrieks and misery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\r\nnow, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\r\nanguish in fearful howlings.  I was like a wild beast that had broken\r\nthe toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\r\nthrough the wood with a stag-like swiftness.  Oh!  What a miserable\r\nnight I passed!  The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\r\nwaved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\r\nburst forth amidst the universal stillness.  All, save I, were at rest\r\nor in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\r\nfinding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\r\nhavoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\r\nthe ruin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\r\nfatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\r\nthe sick impotence of despair.  There was none among the myriads of men\r\nthat existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\r\ntowards my enemies?  No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\r\nagainst the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\r\nand sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\r\nimpossible to return to my retreat during that day.  Accordingly I hid\r\nmyself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\r\nto reflection on my situation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\r\ndegree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\r\ncottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\r\nconclusions.  I had certainly acted imprudently.  It was apparent that\r\nmy conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and  I was a\r\nfool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children.  I\r\nought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\r\nhave discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\r\nbeen  prepared for my approach.  But I did not believe my errors to be\r\nirretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\r\ncottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\r\nparty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\r\nsleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\r\npeaceful dreams.  The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\r\nacting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\r\ntearing me from his father’s feet.  I awoke exhausted, and finding that\r\nit was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\r\nsearch of food.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\r\nwell-known path that conducted to the cottage.  All there was at peace.\r\nI crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\r\naccustomed hour when the family arose.  That hour passed, the sun\r\nmounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear.  I\r\ntrembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune.  The inside\r\nof the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\r\nagony of this suspense.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\r\nentered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\r\nunderstand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\r\nwhich differed from that of my protectors.  Soon after, however, Felix\r\napproached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\r\nquitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\r\nhis discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\r\n‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\r\nthe produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\r\nI beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\r\ndetermination.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\r\nnever again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\r\ndanger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\r\nmy sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\r\nwith me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\r\nplace.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Felix trembled violently as he said this.  He and his companion\r\nentered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\r\ndeparted.  I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\r\nutter and stupid despair.  My protectors had departed and had broken\r\nthe only link that held me to the world.  For the first time the\r\nfeelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\r\ncontrol them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\r\nbent my mind towards injury and death.  When I thought of my friends,\r\nof the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\r\nexquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\r\ntears somewhat soothed me.  But again when I reflected that they had\r\nspurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\r\ninjure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects.  As\r\nnight advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\r\nand after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\r\nI waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\r\noperations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\r\ndispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\r\nalong like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\r\nspirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection.  I lighted the\r\ndry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\r\nmy eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\r\nnearly touched.  A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\r\nbrand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\r\nand bushes, which I had collected.  The wind fanned the fire, and the\r\ncottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\r\nlicked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\r\nthe habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps?  I\r\nresolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\r\nand despised, every country must be equally horrible.  At length the\r\nthought of you crossed my mind.  I learned from your papers that you\r\nwere my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\r\nthan to him who had given me life?  Among the lessons that Felix had\r\nbestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\r\nthese the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\r\nYou had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\r\nthis place I resolved to proceed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But how was I to direct myself?  I knew that I must travel in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\r\nonly guide.  I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\r\nthrough, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\r\ndid not despair.  From you only could I hope for succour, although\r\ntowards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred.  Unfeeling,\r\nheartless creator!  You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\r\nand then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\r\nBut on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\r\ndetermined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\r\nany other being that wore the human form.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense.  It was\r\nlate in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\r\nI travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\r\nhuman being.  Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\r\nrain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\r\nof the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter.  Oh,\r\nearth!  How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being!  The\r\nmildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\r\nand bitterness.  The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\r\ndeeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart.  Snow\r\nfell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not.  A few incidents\r\nnow and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\r\noften wandered wide from my path.  The agony of my feelings allowed me\r\nno respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\r\nnot extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\r\non the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\r\nand the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\r\nmanner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\r\nsecured by night from the view of man.  One morning, however, finding\r\nthat my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\r\nafter the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\r\ncheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\r\nthe air.  I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\r\nappeared dead, revive within me.  Half surprised by the novelty of\r\nthese sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\r\nforgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy.  Soft tears\r\nagain bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\r\nthankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\r\nboundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\r\nof the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\r\nHere I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\r\nthe sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\r\nof a cypress.  I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\r\ntowards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\r\nsomeone in sport.  She continued her course along the precipitous sides\r\nof the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\r\nrapid stream.  I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\r\nfrom the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore.  She\r\nwas senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\r\nanimation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\r\nwho was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled.  On\r\nseeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\r\nhastened towards the deeper parts of the wood.  I followed speedily, I\r\nhardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\r\nwhich he carried, at my body and fired.  I sank to the ground, and my\r\ninjurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This was then the reward of my benevolence!  I had saved a human being\r\nfrom destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\r\npain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone.  The feelings of\r\nkindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\r\nbefore gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth.  Inflamed by\r\npain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.  But the\r\nagony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\r\ncure the wound which I had received.  The ball had entered my shoulder,\r\nand I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\r\nrate I had no means of extracting it.  My sufferings were augmented\r\nalso by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\r\ninfliction.  My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\r\nsuch as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\r\nendured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey.  The\r\nlabours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\r\ngentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\r\ndesolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\r\nthe enjoyment of pleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\r\nreached the environs of Geneva.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\r\nthe fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\r\nto you.  I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\r\nenjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\r\nbehind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\r\nwhich was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\r\nrunning into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\r\ninfancy.  Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\r\nlittle creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\r\nimbibed a horror of deformity.  If, therefore, I could seize him and\r\neducate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\r\nthis peopled earth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\r\ntowards me.  As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\r\nhis eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\r\nface and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this?  I do not intend to\r\nhurt you; listen to me.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\r\n‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\r\nare an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Hideous monster!  Let me go.  My papa is a syndic—he is M.\r\nFrankenstein—he will punish you.  You dare not keep me.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\r\nsworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\r\ndespair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\r\nmoment he lay dead at my feet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\r\ntriumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\r\nmy enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\r\na thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\r\nbreast.  I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman.  In spite\r\nof my malignity, it softened and attracted me.  For a few moments I\r\ngazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\r\nlovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\r\nfor ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\r\nbestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\r\nregarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\r\nexpressive of disgust and affright.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage?  I only\r\nwonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\r\nexclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\r\nattempt to destroy them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\r\ncommitted the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\r\nentered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty.  A woman was\r\nsleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\r\nwhose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\r\nloveliness of youth and health.  Here, I thought, is one of those whose\r\njoy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me.  And then I bent over\r\nher and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\r\ngive his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\r\nbeloved, awake!’\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me.  Should she\r\nindeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\r\nwould she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\r\nThe thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\r\nshe, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\r\nrobbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone.  The crime had\r\nits source in her; be hers the punishment!  Thanks to the lessons of\r\nFelix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\r\nmischief.  I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\r\nthe folds of her dress.  She moved again, and I fled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\r\nsometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\r\nits miseries for ever.  At length I wandered towards these mountains,\r\nand have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\r\npassion which you alone can gratify.  We may not part until you have\r\npromised to comply with my requisition.  I am alone and miserable; man\r\nwill not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\r\nwould not deny herself to me.  My companion must be of the same species\r\nand have the same defects.  This being you must create.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap17\"></a>Chapter 17</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\r\nexpectation of a reply.  But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\r\narrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\r\nproposition.  He continued,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\r\ninterchange of those sympathies necessary for my being.  This you alone\r\ncan do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\r\nconcede.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\r\ndied away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\r\nas he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a\r\nconsent from me.  You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\r\nshall never make me base in my own eyes.  Shall I create another like\r\nyourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world.  Begone!  I\r\nhave answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead\r\nof threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\r\nam miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\r\nwould tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\r\nshould pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\r\ncould precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\r\nwork of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\r\nlive with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\r\nbestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\r\nBut that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\r\nunion. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\r\nrevenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\r\nchiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\r\ninextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\r\nfinish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\r\nyour birth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\r\ninto contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\r\nhe calmed himself and proceeded—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\r\nnot reflect that <i>you</i> are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\r\nemotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\r\nhundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the\r\nwhole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\r\nWhat I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\r\nanother sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\r\nis all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\r\nmonsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\r\nattached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\r\nharmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\r\nhappy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\r\nexcite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\r\nrequest!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was moved.  I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\r\nof my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\r\nHis tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\r\nof fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\r\nof happiness that it was in my power to bestow?  He saw my change of\r\nfeeling and continued,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\r\nus again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America.  My food is not\r\nthat of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\r\nacorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment.  My companion will\r\nbe of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\r\nWe shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\r\nman and will ripen our food.  The picture I present to you is peaceful\r\nand human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\r\nwantonness of power and cruelty.  Pitiless as you have been towards me,\r\nI now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\r\nand persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\r\nman, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\r\nonly companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\r\npersevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\r\nyou will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\r\nand you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\r\nThis may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\r\nmy representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\r\nI swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\r\nwith the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\r\ndwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\r\nwill have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\r\naway, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis words had a strange effect upon me.  I compassionated him and\r\nsometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\r\nI saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\r\nfeelings were altered to those of horror and hatred.  I tried to stifle\r\nthese sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\r\nhad no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\r\nwas yet in my power to bestow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\r\nalready shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\r\nyou? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\r\naffording a wider scope for your revenge?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How is this?  I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer.  If\r\nI have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\r\nthe love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\r\nbecome a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant.  My vices\r\nare the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\r\nnecessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal.  I shall feel\r\nthe affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\r\nexistence and events from which I am now excluded.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\r\narguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\r\nhe had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\r\nof all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\r\nmanifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\r\ncalculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\r\nand hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\r\nwas a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\r\nlong pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\r\nmy fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\r\nTurning to him, therefore, I said,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\r\nand every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\r\ndeliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\r\nheaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\r\nprayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\r\nhome and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\r\nunutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\r\nappear.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSaying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\r\nmy sentiments.  I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\r\nthe flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\r\nsea of ice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\r\nthe horizon when he departed.  I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\r\ntowards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\r\nheart was heavy, and my steps slow.  The labour of winding among the\r\nlittle paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\r\nperplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\r\nof the day had produced.  Night was far advanced when I came to the\r\nhalfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain.  The stars\r\nshone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\r\nrose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\r\nground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\r\nthoughts within me.  I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\r\nexclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\r\nme; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\r\nnought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\r\nhow the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\r\nlistened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\r\nway to consume me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMorning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\r\nrest, but returned immediately to Geneva.  Even in my own heart I could\r\ngive no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a\r\nmountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\r\nThus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\r\nfamily.  My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\r\nanswered no question, scarcely did I speak.  I felt as if I were placed\r\nunder a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if\r\nnever more might I enjoy companionship with them.  Yet even thus I\r\nloved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\r\nmyself to my most abhorred task.  The prospect of such an occupation\r\nmade every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\r\nand that thought only had to me the reality of life.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap18\"></a>Chapter 18</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nDay after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\r\nI could not collect the courage to recommence my work.  I feared the\r\nvengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\r\nrepugnance to the task which was enjoined me.  I found that I could not\r\ncompose a female without again devoting several months to profound\r\nstudy and laborious disquisition.  I had heard of some discoveries\r\nhaving been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\r\nmaterial to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\r\nfather’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\r\nevery pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\r\nundertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\r\nme.  A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\r\nhitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\r\nunchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably.  My\r\nfather saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\r\ntowards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\r\nwhich every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\r\nblackness overcast the approaching sunshine.  At these moments I took\r\nrefuge in the most perfect solitude.  I passed whole days on the lake\r\nalone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\r\nrippling of the waves, silent and listless.  But the fresh air and\r\nbright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\r\non my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\r\nand a more cheerful heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\r\ncalling me aside, thus addressed me,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\r\npleasures and seem to be returning to yourself.  And yet you are still\r\nunhappy and still avoid our society.  For some time I was lost in\r\nconjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\r\nand if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it.  Reserve on such a\r\npoint would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\r\nmarriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\r\nstay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\r\nearliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\r\ntastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\r\nman that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\r\nentirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\r\nwish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\r\nwhom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\r\nElizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\r\nto feel.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear father, reassure yourself.  I love my cousin tenderly and\r\nsincerely.  I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\r\nwarmest admiration and affection.  My future hopes and prospects are\r\nentirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\r\ngives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced.  If you\r\nfeel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\r\na gloom over us.  But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\r\nstrong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate.  Tell me,\r\ntherefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\r\nmarriage.  We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\r\nfrom that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\r\nare younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\r\nfortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\r\nplans of honour and utility that you may have formed.  Do not suppose,\r\nhowever, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\r\nyour part would cause me any serious uneasiness.  Interpret my words\r\nwith candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\r\nsincerity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\r\nof offering any reply.  I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\r\nthoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion.  Alas!  To me\r\nthe idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\r\ndismay.  I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\r\nand dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\r\nimpend over me and my devoted family!  Could I enter into a festival\r\nwith this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\r\nground?  I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\r\nhis mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\r\nwhich I expected peace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\r\nEngland or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\r\nof that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\r\nuse to me in my present undertaking.  The latter method of obtaining\r\nthe desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\r\nhad an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\r\nloathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\r\nintercourse with those I loved.  I knew that a thousand fearful\r\naccidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\r\nthrill all connected with me with horror.  I was aware also that I\r\nshould often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\r\nharrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\r\nunearthly occupation.  I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\r\nemployed.  Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\r\nrestored to my family in peace and happiness.  My promise fulfilled,\r\nthe monster would depart for ever.  Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\r\naccident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\r\nslavery for ever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese feelings dictated my answer to my father.  I expressed a wish to\r\nvisit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\r\nclothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\r\nurged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\r\ncomply.  After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\r\nresembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\r\nthat I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\r\nand he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\r\nreturn, have restored me entirely to myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\r\nat most a year, was the period contemplated.  One paternal kind\r\nprecaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion.  Without\r\npreviously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\r\narranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh.  This interfered\r\nwith the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\r\ncommencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\r\nan impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\r\nhours of lonely, maddening reflection.  Nay, Henry might stand between\r\nme and the intrusion of my foe.  If I were alone, would he not at times\r\nforce his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\r\ncontemplate its progress?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\r\nwith Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return.  My father’s\r\nage rendered him extremely averse to delay.  For myself, there was one\r\nreward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\r\nunparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\r\nenfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\r\nforget the past in my union with her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\r\nwhich filled me with fear and agitation.  During my absence I should\r\nleave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\r\nunprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\r\ndeparture.  But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\r\nwould he not accompany me to England?  This imagination was dreadful in\r\nitself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\r\nI was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\r\nthis might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the\r\nslave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\r\nthe moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\r\nwould follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\r\nmachinations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\r\ncountry.  My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\r\ntherefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\r\nmy suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief.  It had\r\nbeen her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\r\nis blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\r\nsedulous attention.  She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\r\nconflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\r\nfarewell.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\r\nknowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\r\nI remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\r\nit, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\r\nme.  Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\r\nand majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could\r\nonly think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\r\nme whilst they endured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\r\nmany leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\r\nClerval.  He came.  Alas, how great was the contrast between us!  He\r\nwas alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\r\nsetting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\r\nday.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\r\nthe appearances of the sky.  “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\r\n“now I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\r\nyou desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\r\nthoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\r\nsunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more\r\namused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\r\neye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a\r\nmiserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\r\nenjoyment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\r\nRotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this\r\nvoyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\r\nWe stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\r\nStrasburgh, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz\r\nbecomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds\r\nbetween hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw\r\nmany ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\r\nblack woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,\r\npresents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view\r\nrugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\r\nthe dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\r\nflourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\r\nand populous towns occupy the scene.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\r\nas we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\r\ncontinually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\r\nbottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\r\ndrink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\r\nwere my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\r\nbeen transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\r\nman. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\r\nof my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\r\nsnowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\r\nand impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\r\nwere it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\r\nappearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\r\nup whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\r\non the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\r\nwhere the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\r\nwhere their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\r\nnightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\r\nbut this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\r\nmountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\r\ncharm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\r\nLook at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\r\nisland, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\r\nthat group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\r\nhalf hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\r\nand guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\r\npile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\r\nour own country.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nClerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\r\nto dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\r\nbeing formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\r\nenthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\r\nsoul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\r\ndevoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\r\nin the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\r\nonly with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n     ——The sounding cataract<br>\r\n     Haunted him like a passion:  the tall rock,<br>\r\n     The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br>\r\n     Their colours and their forms, were then to him<br>\r\n     An appetite; a feeling, and a love,<br>\r\n     That had no need of a remoter charm,<br>\r\n     By thought supplied, or any interest<br>\r\n     Unborrow’d from the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                    [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd where does he now exist?  Is this gentle and lovely being lost\r\nfor ever?  Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\r\nand magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\r\nlife of its creator;—has this mind perished?  Does it now only exist\r\nin my memory?  No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\r\nbeaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\r\nconsoles your unhappy friend.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\r\ntribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\r\noverflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates.  I will\r\nproceed with my tale.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\r\npost the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\r\nthe river was too gentle to aid us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\r\narrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\r\nIt was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\r\nthe white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\r\nthey were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\r\nremembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\r\nArmada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\r\nof even in my country.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\r\nabove all, and the Tower famed in English history.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap19\"></a>Chapter 19</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nLondon was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\r\nmonths in this wonderful and celebrated city.  Clerval desired the\r\nintercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\r\ntime, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\r\noccupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\r\ncompletion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\r\nintroduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\r\ndistinguished natural philosophers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\r\nit would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure.  But a blight had\r\ncome over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\r\nthe information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\r\nwas so terribly profound.  Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\r\ncould fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\r\nHenry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\r\npeace.  But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\r\nmy heart.  I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\r\nfellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\r\nJustine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\r\nmy soul with anguish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\r\nand anxious to gain experience and instruction.  The difference of\r\nmanners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\r\ninstruction and amusement.  He was also pursuing an object he had long\r\nhad in view.  His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\r\nin his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\r\ntaken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\r\nEuropean colonization and trade.  In Britain only could he further the\r\nexecution of his plan.  He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\r\nenjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind.  I tried to conceal this\r\nas much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\r\nnatural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\r\nany care or bitter recollection.  I often refused to accompany him,\r\nalleging another engagement, that I might remain alone.  I now also\r\nbegan to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\r\nwas to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\r\non the head.  Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\r\nanguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\r\nto quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\r\nScotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\r\nbeauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\r\nallurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\r\nwhere he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\r\nalthough I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\r\nall the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\r\nFebruary. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\r\nnorth at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\r\nintend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\r\nMatlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\r\nthis tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\r\nthe materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\r\nobscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\r\nWindsor, rambling in its beautiful forest.  This was a new scene to us\r\nmountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\r\nstately deer were all novelties to us.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom thence we proceeded to Oxford.  As we entered this city, our minds\r\nwere filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\r\nthere more than a century and a half before.  It was here that Charles\r\nI. had collected his forces.  This city had remained faithful to him,\r\nafter the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\r\nParliament and liberty.  The memory of that unfortunate king and his\r\ncompanions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\r\nson, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\r\nmight be supposed to have inhabited.  The spirit of elder days found a\r\ndwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps.  If these\r\nfeelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\r\nthe city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\r\nThe colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\r\nmagnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\r\nof exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\r\nwhich reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\r\ndomes, embosomed among aged trees.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\r\nmemory of the past and the anticipation of the future.  I was formed\r\nfor peaceful happiness.  During my youthful days discontent never\r\nvisited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by <i>ennui</i>, the sight of what\r\nis beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\r\nthe productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\r\nelasticity to my spirits.  But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\r\nentered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\r\nI shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\r\npitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\r\nand endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\r\nanimating epoch of English history.  Our little voyages of discovery\r\nwere often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\r\nthemselves.  We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\r\nfield on which that patriot fell.  For a moment my soul was elevated\r\nfrom its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\r\nof liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\r\nand the remembrancers.  For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\r\nand look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\r\ninto my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\r\nmiserable self.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\r\nplace of rest.  The country in the neighbourhood of this village\r\nresembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\r\neverything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\r\ndistant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\r\nnative country.  We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\r\nof natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\r\nmanner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix.  The latter name\r\nmade me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\r\nMatlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\r\nCumberland and Westmorland.  I could now almost fancy myself among the\r\nSwiss mountains.  The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\r\nnorthern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\r\nrocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me.  Here also we\r\nmade some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\r\nhappiness.  The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\r\nmine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\r\nin his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\r\nimagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\r\ninferiors.  “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\r\nthese mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\r\namidst its enjoyments.  His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\r\nwhen he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\r\nthat on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\r\nengages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\r\nand conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\r\nof our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\r\nto travel on.  For my own part I was not sorry.  I had now neglected my\r\npromise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\r\ndisappointment.  He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\r\non my relatives.  This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\r\nfrom which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace.  I waited\r\nfor my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\r\nmiserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\r\nsaw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\r\nread and ascertain my fate.  Sometimes I thought that the fiend\r\nfollowed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\r\nWhen these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\r\nbut followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\r\nhis destroyer.  I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\r\nconsciousness of which haunted me.  I was guiltless, but I had indeed\r\ndrawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\r\nhave interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\r\nas Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\r\nBut the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\r\ncastle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\r\nSeat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\r\nthe change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\r\nimpatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\r\nalong the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\r\nBut I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\r\ntheir feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\r\naccordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\r\nalone.  “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\r\nrendezvous.  I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\r\nmy motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\r\ntime; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\r\ncongenial to your own temper.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHenry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\r\nremonstrate.  He entreated me to write often.  “I had rather be with\r\nyou,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\r\npeople, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear  friend, to return,\r\nthat I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\r\nyour absence.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\r\nScotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\r\nmonster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\r\nfinished, that he might receive his companion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\r\nthe remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\r\nfitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\r\ncontinually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\r\naffording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\r\ninhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\r\ngave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\r\nindulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\r\nthe mainland, which was about five miles distant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\r\nthese was vacant when I arrived.  This I hired.  It contained but two\r\nrooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\r\npenury.  The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\r\ndoor was off its hinges.  I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\r\nfurniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\r\noccasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\r\nbenumbed by want and squalid poverty.  As it was, I lived ungazed at\r\nand unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\r\nwhich I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\r\nof men.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\r\nwhen the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\r\nlisten to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet.  It was a\r\nmonotonous yet ever-changing scene.  I thought of Switzerland; it was\r\nfar different from this desolate and appalling landscape.  Its hills\r\nare covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\r\nplains.  Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\r\ntroubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\r\ninfant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\r\nas I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\r\nirksome to me.  Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\r\nlaboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\r\nin order to complete my work.  It was, indeed, a filthy process in\r\nwhich I was engaged.  During my first experiment, a kind of\r\nenthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\r\nmind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\r\nwere shut to the horror of my proceedings.  But now I went to it in\r\ncold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\r\na solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\r\nthe actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\r\ngrew restless and nervous.  Every moment I feared to meet my\r\npersecutor.  Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\r\nto raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\r\ndreaded to behold.  I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\r\ncreatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\r\nadvanced.  I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\r\nhope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\r\nintermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\r\nin my bosom.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap20\"></a>Chapter 20</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nI sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\r\nrising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\r\nremained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\r\nlabour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\r\nto it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\r\nconsider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\r\nengaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\r\nbarbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\r\nremorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\r\nalike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\r\nmate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\r\nsworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\r\nhad not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\r\nreasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\r\ncreation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\r\nloathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\r\nfor it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\r\nwith disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\r\nand he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\r\ndeserted by one of his own species.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\r\nyet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\r\nthirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\r\nthe earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\r\ncondition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\r\nto inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\r\nby the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\r\nhis fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\r\npromise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\r\nas their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\r\nthe price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\r\nthe light of the moon the dæmon at the casement.  A ghastly grin\r\nwrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\r\nwhich he had allotted to me.  Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\r\nhad loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\r\nand desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\r\nfulfilment of my promise.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\r\nmalice and treachery.  I thought with a sensation of madness on my\r\npromise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\r\ntore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged.  The wretch saw me\r\ndestroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\r\nhappiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\r\nheart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\r\nsought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\r\nthe gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\r\nterrible reveries.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\r\nit was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\r\nreposed under the eye of the quiet moon.  A few fishing vessels alone\r\nspecked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\r\nof voices as the fishermen called to one another.  I felt the silence,\r\nalthough I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\r\nwas suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\r\nperson landed close to my house.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\r\nendeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\r\npresentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\r\ndwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\r\nof helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\r\nendeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPresently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\r\nopened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\r\napproached me and said in a smothered voice,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\r\nintend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\r\nI left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\r\nits willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\r\nmonths in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\r\nendured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\r\nhopes?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Begone!  I do break my promise; never will I create another like\r\nyourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\r\nunworthy of my condescension.  Remember that I have power; you believe\r\nyourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\r\nday will be hateful to you.  You are my creator, but I am your master;\r\nobey!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\r\narrived.  Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\r\nthey confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\r\nvice.  Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\r\ndelight is in death and wretchedness?  Begone!  I am firm, and your\r\nwords will only exasperate my rage.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\r\nimpotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\r\nwife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\r\nfeelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\r\nMan! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\r\nand soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\r\never. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\r\nwretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\r\nremains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\r\nfirst you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\r\nmisery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\r\nthe wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\r\nrepent of the injuries you inflict.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\r\nI have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\r\nbeneath words.  Leave me; I am inexorable.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is well.  I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\r\nwedding-night.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI started forward and exclaimed, “Villain!  Before you sign my\r\ndeath-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\r\nprecipitation.  In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\r\nacross the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\r\nwaves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\r\npursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\r\nwalked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\r\nconjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\r\nfollowed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\r\nto depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\r\nto think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\r\nAnd then I thought again of his words—“<i>I will be with you on\r\nyour wedding-night.</i>” That, then, was the period fixed for the\r\nfulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\r\nextinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\r\nthought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\r\nshould find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\r\nhad shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\r\nbefore my enemy without a bitter struggle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\r\ncalmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\r\nthe depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\r\nnight’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\r\nalmost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\r\ncreatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\r\ndesired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\r\nbut uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\r\nbe sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\r\ndæmon whom I had myself created.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\r\nloved and miserable in the separation.  When it became noon, and the\r\nsun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\r\nsleep.  I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\r\nwere agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep\r\ninto which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\r\nif I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\r\nreflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\r\nwords of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\r\nlike a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\r\nappetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\r\nfishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\r\nit contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\r\njoin him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\r\nhe was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\r\nhis return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\r\nIndian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\r\nhis journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\r\nconjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\r\nmy society on him as I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to\r\nleave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\r\nsouthwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\r\nI determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\r\nto reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\r\nmust enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\r\nhandle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\r\nmorning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\r\nof my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\r\ndestroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\r\nmangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\r\nthen entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\r\nout of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\r\nwork to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\r\nput them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\r\nup, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\r\nmeantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\r\nchemical apparatus.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\r\nin my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon.  I had\r\nbefore regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\r\nwhatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\r\nhad been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\r\nclearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\r\nto me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\r\nreflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in\r\nmy own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\r\nwould be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\r\nbanished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\r\nconclusion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBetween two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\r\nbasket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\r\nThe scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\r\nbut I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\r\ndreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\r\nfellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\r\nsuddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\r\ndarkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\r\nas it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\r\nthe air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\r\nrising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\r\nthat I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\r\ndirect position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\r\nmoon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\r\nkeel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\r\nslept soundly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\r\nfound that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\r\nthe waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\r\nthat the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\r\nwhich I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\r\nthat if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\r\nwater. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\r\nconfess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\r\nand was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\r\nworld that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\r\nwide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\r\nthe immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\r\nbeen out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\r\nmy other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\r\nthat flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\r\nsea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\r\ntask is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\r\nof Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\r\nsanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\r\ndespairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\r\nclosing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\r\nhorizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\r\nfree from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\r\nand hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\r\nland towards the south.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlmost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\r\nfor several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\r\nwarm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\r\nof life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\r\npart of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\r\nwild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\r\nthe traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\r\nsuddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\r\ncarefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\r\nlength saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\r\nextreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\r\nwhere I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\r\nme. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\r\nharbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\r\nescape.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\r\npeople crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my\r\nappearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\r\ntogether with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\r\na slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\r\nspoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  “My\r\ngood friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\r\nthis town and inform me where I am?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\r\n“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\r\nbut you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\r\nstranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\r\nangry countenances of his companions.  “Why do you answer me so\r\nroughly?”  I replied.  “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\r\nreceive strangers so inhospitably.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\r\nEnglish may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\r\nincrease. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\r\nannoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\r\nno one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\r\ncrowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\r\napproaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\r\nfollow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myself?  Is not\r\nthis a free country?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\r\nand you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\r\nfound murdered here last night.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\r\nthat could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\r\nand was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\r\nfatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\r\nto rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\r\napprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\r\nwas in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\r\nall fear of ignominy or death.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\r\nthe frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\r\nrecollection.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap21\"></a>Chapter 21</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nI was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\r\nbenevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however,\r\nwith some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\r\nhe asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\r\nmagistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\r\nhis son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\r\nthey observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\r\nfor port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\r\nnot land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\r\ntwo miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\r\nand his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\r\nalong the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\r\nlength on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\r\nlight of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\r\nwho was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\r\ncorpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\r\nwaves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\r\nthat the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\r\nof an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\r\nto life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\r\nyears of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\r\nany violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\r\nwhen the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\r\nmy brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\r\nmist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\r\nsupport.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\r\nan unfavourable augury from my manner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\r\ncalled he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\r\nsaw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\r\nand as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\r\nboat in which I had just landed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\r\nof her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\r\nbefore she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\r\nonly one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\r\nwas afterwards found.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnother woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\r\nbody into her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and\r\nrubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\r\nquite gone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\r\nthat, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\r\nwas very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\r\nobliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\r\nBesides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\r\nfrom another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\r\nthe shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\r\nof the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\r\nthe room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\r\neffect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\r\nsuggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\r\nmurder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\r\nand several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\r\nstrange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\r\nknowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\r\ninhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\r\ntranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\r\ncan I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\r\nhorror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\r\nagony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\r\npassed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\r\nClerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\r\nthe body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\r\nalso, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\r\nvictims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\r\nbenefactor—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\r\nI was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\r\nravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\r\nmurderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\r\nattendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\r\ntormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\r\nmy neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\r\nmy native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\r\nbitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\r\nsink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\r\nchildren, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\r\nyouthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\r\nnext a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\r\nmade that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\r\nthe wheel, continually renewed the torture?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\r\na dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\r\ngaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\r\nIt was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\r\nforgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\r\ngreat misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\r\nand saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\r\nwas, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\r\nme.  She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\r\ncountenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\r\nthat class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\r\npersons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\r\ntone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\r\nand the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\r\nbut if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\r\nstill alive to feel this misery and horror.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\r\ngentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\r\nwere dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, that’s none\r\nof my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\r\nwith a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\r\nspeech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\r\nlanguid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The whole series\r\nof my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\r\nwere all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\r\nof reality.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\r\nfeverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\r\nme with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The\r\nphysician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\r\nthem for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\r\nexpression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\r\nsecond.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\r\nhangman who would gain his fee?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThese were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\r\nshown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room in the prison\r\nto be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\r\nhad provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to\r\nsee me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\r\nevery human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\r\nmiserable ravings of a murderer.  He came, therefore, sometimes to see\r\nthat I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\r\nintervals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\r\nhalf open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\r\nand misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\r\nremain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\r\nconsidered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\r\npenalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\r\nthoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\r\nHis countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\r\nmine and addressed me in French,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\r\nmake you more comfortable?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\r\nearth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\r\none borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I\r\nhope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\r\neasily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\r\nthe most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and tortured as I am and\r\nhave been, can death be any evil to me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\r\nstrange chances that have lately occurred.  You were thrown, by some\r\nsurprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\r\nseized immediately, and charged with murder.  The first sight that was\r\npresented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\r\nunaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\r\nyour path.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\r\nthis retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\r\nthe knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  I suppose some\r\nastonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\r\nto say,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\r\nyour person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\r\ntrace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\r\nand illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\r\ndiscovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\r\nto Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\r\nBut you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\r\nkind.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\r\ntell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\r\nnow to lament?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\r\ngentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\r\ninstantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\r\nmisery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\r\nme to comply with his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes,\r\nand cried out in agony,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\r\nlet him enter!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help\r\nregarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\r\nrather a severe tone,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\r\nwould have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\r\nfrom anguish to pleasure.  “Is my father indeed come?  How kind, how\r\nvery kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\r\nthought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\r\nand now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.  He rose and\r\nquitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\r\narrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\r\ndwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\r\ndesponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\r\ncheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\r\nsaid he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\r\nof the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\r\nto pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\r\ngreat to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\r\nmost horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\r\nshould have died on the coffin of Henry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\r\nprecarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\r\ncould ensure tranquillity.  Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\r\nstrength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  But the\r\nappearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\r\ngradually recovered my health.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\r\nmelancholy that nothing could dissipate.  The image of Clerval was\r\nfor ever before me, ghastly and murdered.  More than once the agitation\r\ninto which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\r\nrelapse.  Alas!  Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\r\nlife?  It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\r\ndrawing to a close.  Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\r\nthrobbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\r\nme to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\r\nsink to rest.  Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\r\nwish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\r\nmotionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\r\nmight bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe season of the assizes approached.  I had already been three months\r\nin prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\r\nrelapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\r\ntown where the court was held.  Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\r\ncare of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  I was spared\r\nthe disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\r\nbrought before the court that decides on life and death.  The grand\r\njury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\r\nIslands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\r\nafter my removal I was liberated from prison.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\r\ncriminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\r\natmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.  I did not\r\nparticipate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\r\npalace were alike hateful.  The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\r\nalthough the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\r\nsaw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\r\nno light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.  Sometimes\r\nthey were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\r\norbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\r\nthem; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\r\nfirst saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.  He talked\r\nof Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\r\nthese words only drew deep groans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\r\nwish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\r\ncousin or longed, with a devouring <i>maladie du pays</i>, to see once more\r\nthe blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\r\nchildhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\r\nprison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\r\nthese fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\r\ndespair.  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\r\nexistence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\r\nto restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\r\ntriumphed over my selfish despair.  It was necessary that I should\r\nreturn without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\r\nI so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\r\nchance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\r\nblast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\r\nthe existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the\r\nmockery of a soul still more monstrous.  My father still desired to\r\ndelay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\r\njourney, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being.  My\r\nstrength was gone.  I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\r\npreyed upon my wasted frame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStill, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\r\nmy father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\r\nbound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\r\nIt was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\r\nthe dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\r\nsight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\r\nsoon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\r\nyet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\r\nshore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\r\nthat I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\r\ncompanion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\r\nrepassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\r\nwith my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\r\nIngolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\r\nto the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\r\nwhich he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\r\nthousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEver since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\r\nevery night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\r\nonly that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\r\nlife. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\r\nswallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\r\nnot afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\r\nthousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\r\nof nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\r\nmyself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\r\nwatching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\r\nwere around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\r\nsecurity, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\r\nand the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\r\nforgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\r\nsusceptible.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap22\"></a>Chapter 22</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe voyage came to an end.  We landed, and proceeded to Paris.  I soon\r\nfound that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\r\ncould continue my journey.  My father’s care and attentions were\r\nindefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\r\nsought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill.  He wished me to\r\nseek amusement in society.  I abhorred the face of man.  Oh, not\r\nabhorred!  They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\r\nattracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\r\nangelic nature and celestial mechanism.  But I felt that I had no right\r\nto share their intercourse.  I had unchained an enemy among them whose\r\njoy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans.  How they\r\nwould, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\r\nmy unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\r\nvarious arguments to banish my despair.  Sometimes he thought that I\r\nfelt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\r\nmurder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alas!  My father,” said I, “how little do you know me.\r\nHuman beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\r\na wretch as I felt pride.  Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\r\nas I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\r\nof this—I murdered her.  William, Justine, and Henry—they all\r\ndied by my hands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\r\nassertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\r\nexplanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\r\ndelirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\r\nitself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\r\nconvalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\r\nconcerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\r\nsupposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\r\nbesides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\r\nhearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\r\nhis breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\r\nsilent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\r\nYet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\r\nfrom me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\r\nrelieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUpon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\r\n“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\r\nyou never to make such an assertion again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\r\nhave viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth.  I am the\r\nassassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\r\nA thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\r\nsaved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\r\nsacrifice the whole human race.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\r\nderanged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\r\nendeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts.  He wished as much as\r\npossible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\r\nIreland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\r\nmisfortunes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\r\nheart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\r\ncrimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them.  By the utmost\r\nself-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\r\nsometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\r\nwere calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\r\nto the sea of ice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\r\nfollowing letter from Elizabeth:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\n“My dear Friend,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\r\ndated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\r\nhope to see you in less than a fortnight.  My poor cousin, how much you\r\nmust have suffered!  I expect to see you looking even more ill than\r\nwhen you quitted Geneva.  This winter has been passed most miserably,\r\ntortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\r\nyour countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\r\ncomfort and tranquillity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\r\na year ago, even perhaps augmented by time.  I would not disturb you at\r\nthis period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\r\nconversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\r\nsome explanation necessary before we meet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nExplanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\r\nyou really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\r\nBut you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\r\nbe pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\r\ncase, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\r\nhave often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\r\nyour parents ever since our infancy.  We were told this when young, and\r\ntaught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\r\nplace.  We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\r\nbelieve, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\r\nas brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\r\nother without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\r\ncase?  Tell me, dearest Victor.  Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\r\nhappiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\r\nIngolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\r\nautumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\r\ncreature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\r\nconnection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\r\nyour parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\r\nBut this is false reasoning.  I confess to you, my friend, that I love\r\nyou and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\r\nfriend and companion.   But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\r\nown when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\r\nmiserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice.  Even now\r\nI weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\r\nmisfortunes, you may stifle, by the word <i>honour</i>, all hope of that\r\nlove and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself.  I, who\r\nhave so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\r\ntenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes.  Ah! Victor, be assured\r\nthat your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\r\nmade miserable by this supposition.  Be happy, my friend; and if you\r\nobey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\r\nwill have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\r\nnext day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain.  My uncle\r\nwill send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\r\nlips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\r\nshall need no other happiness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\n“Elizabeth Lavenza.<br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\n“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”<br><br>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\r\nthe fiend—“<i>I will be with you on your\r\nwedding-night!</i>” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\r\ndæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\r\nhappiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\r\nhad determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\r\ndeadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\r\nvictorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\r\nwere vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\r\npeasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\r\ncottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\r\npenniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\r\nElizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\r\nremorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\r\nsoftened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\r\ndreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\r\nangel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\r\nher happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\r\nagain, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\r\ndestruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\r\nshould suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\r\nsurely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\r\n<i>to be with me on my wedding-night</i>, yet he did not consider that\r\nthreat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\r\nhe was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\r\nafter the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\r\nimmediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\r\nfather’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life\r\nshould not retard it a single hour.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth.  My letter was calm and\r\naffectionate.  “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\r\nremains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\r\nyou.  Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\r\nand my endeavours for contentment.  I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\r\ndreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\r\nhorror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\r\nwonder that I survive what I have endured.  I will confide this tale of\r\nmisery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\r\nfor, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us.  But\r\nuntil then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it.  This I most\r\nearnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned\r\nto Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\r\nin her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\r\nchange in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\r\nvivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\r\ncompassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\r\nwas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\r\nwith it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\r\nme; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\r\ndespondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\r\nbewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\r\nwould soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\r\nfeelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\r\nreturned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\r\nresignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\r\nguilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\r\notherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSoon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\r\nElizabeth. I remained silent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“None on earth.  I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\r\ndelight.  Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\r\nmyself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Victor, do not speak thus.  Heavy misfortunes have befallen\r\nus, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\r\nfor those whom we have lost to those who yet live.  Our circle will be\r\nsmall but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\r\nAnd when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\r\ncare will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\r\ndeprived.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch were the lessons of my father.  But to me the remembrance of the\r\nthreat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\r\nyet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\r\ninvincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “<i>I shall be with\r\nyou on your wedding-night</i>,” I should regard the threatened fate as\r\nunavoidable.  But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\r\nbalanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\r\ncountenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\r\nceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\r\nthe seal to my fate.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGreat God!  If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\r\nintention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\r\nfor ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\r\nthe earth than have consented to this miserable marriage.  But, as if\r\npossessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\r\nintentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\r\nhastened that of a far dearer victim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\r\na prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\r\nfeelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\r\ncountenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\r\neye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\r\nnot unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\r\nthat what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\r\ninto an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPreparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\r\nand all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\r\nheart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\r\ninto the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\r\ndecorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\r\nthe inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\r\ngovernment. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\r\nwas agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\r\nLavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\r\nnear which it stood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\r\nfiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger\r\nconstantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\r\nby these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the\r\nperiod approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\r\nregarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\r\nin my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\r\nfor its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\r\nas an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\r\ncalm her mind.  But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\r\ndestiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\r\nand perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\r\npromised to reveal to her on the following day.  My father was in the\r\nmeantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\r\nthe melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\r\nfather’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\r\njourney by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\r\nvoyage on the following day.  The day was fair, the wind favourable;\r\nall smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThose were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\r\nfeeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\r\nwere sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\r\nbeauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\r\nMont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\r\nsurmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\r\nmountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\r\nopposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\r\nambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\r\ninsurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI took the hand of Elizabeth.  “You are sorrowful, my love.  Ah!  If\r\nyou knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\r\nendeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\r\none day at least permits me to enjoy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\r\nnothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\r\npainted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me\r\nnot to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\r\nwill not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move\r\nalong and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\r\nabove the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\r\ninteresting.  Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\r\nthe clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\r\nthe bottom.  What a divine day!  How happy and serene all nature\r\nappears!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\r\nreflection upon melancholy subjects.  But her temper was fluctuating;\r\njoy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\r\nto distraction and reverie.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\r\nobserved its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\r\nlower hills.  The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\r\nthe amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary.  The\r\nspire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\r\nof mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\r\nsank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\r\nand caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\r\nshore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\r\nhay.  The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\r\nthe shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\r\nme and cling to me for ever.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap23\"></a>Chapter 23</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\r\nshore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\r\ncontemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\r\nin darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\r\nin the west.  The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\r\nbeginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\r\nflight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\r\nscene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\r\nthat were beginning to rise.  Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\r\nshapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind.  I was anxious\r\nand watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\r\nmy bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\r\nlife dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\r\nof my adversary was extinguished.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nElizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\r\nbut there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\r\ntrembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\r\nWhat is it you fear?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\r\nall will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\r\nfearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\r\nand I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\r\nuntil I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\r\nof the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\r\nmy adversary.  But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\r\nconjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\r\nexecution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\r\nscream.  It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired.  As I\r\nheard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\r\nmotion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\r\ntrickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\r\nstate lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\r\ninto the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGreat God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\r\ndestruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\r\nthere, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\r\nand her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\r\nturn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\r\nby the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\r\nLife is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\r\nonly did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\r\ncountenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\r\nappeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\r\nescaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\r\nwife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\r\nposture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\r\nher arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\r\nsupposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\r\nthe deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\r\nin my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\r\nThe murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\r\nbreath had ceased to issue from her lips.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\r\nThe windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\r\npanic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\r\nThe shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\r\ndescribed, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\r\nA grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\r\nfiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\r\nthe window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\r\nleaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\r\nplunged into the lake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\r\nthe spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\r\nboats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, we\r\nreturned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\r\nform conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to\r\nsearch the country, parties going in different directions among the\r\nwoods and vines.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\r\nhouse, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\r\nman, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\r\neyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I\r\nwas carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\r\nhappened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\r\nI had lost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\r\nwhere the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I\r\nhung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\r\ndistinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\r\nvarious subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\r\ncause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death\r\nof William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\r\nof my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\r\nfriends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\r\nmight be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\r\nfeet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started\r\nup and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\r\nwind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\r\nhardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\r\nto row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\r\nmental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\r\nand the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\r\nexertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\r\nto every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\r\nfamiliar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\r\nbefore in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\r\nTears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\r\nthe fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\r\nthen been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\r\na great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\r\nbut nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\r\nsnatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\r\nso miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\r\nman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\r\noverwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\r\n<i>acme</i>, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\r\nthat, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\r\nown strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\r\nmy hideous narration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\r\nunder the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\r\nman! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\r\ndelight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\r\nall that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\r\nfew affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\r\nbe the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\r\nin wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\r\naround him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\r\nrise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat then became of me?  I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\r\ndarkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,\r\nindeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\r\nwith the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\r\ndungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\r\nconception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\r\nprison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\r\nunderstood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLiberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\r\nawakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the\r\nmemory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\r\ncause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\r\nsent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a\r\nmaddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\r\nthat I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\r\nrevenge on his cursed head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\r\nreflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\r\na month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\r\nand told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\r\ndestroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\r\nauthority for the apprehension of the murderer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\r\nassured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\r\nbe spared to discover the villain.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\r\ndeposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\r\nshould fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\r\nwhich, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\r\nbe mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\r\nmanner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\r\nown heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\r\nquieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\r\nmy history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\r\naccuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\r\nhe became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\r\nhorror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\r\non his countenance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\r\naccuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\r\nwhole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\r\nyour feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\r\nfunctions on this occasion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\r\nauditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\r\nto a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\r\nto act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\r\nreturned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\r\nevery aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\r\nhave powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\r\nanimal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\r\nno man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\r\nthe commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\r\nhas wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\r\nhe has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\r\nand destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\r\ncredit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\r\npunishment which is his desert.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\r\n“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\r\nit is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\r\npunishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\r\nyourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\r\nimpracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\r\nmake up your mind to disappointment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My\r\nrevenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\r\nconfess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage\r\nis unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\r\nloose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have\r\nbut one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\r\nhis destruction.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\r\nin my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\r\nwhich the martyrs of old are said to have possessed.  But to a Genevan\r\nmagistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\r\ndevotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\r\nmadness.  He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\r\nreverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\r\nwisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\r\nsome other mode of action.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap24\"></a>Chapter 24</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nMy present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\r\nswallowed up and lost.  I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\r\nendowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\r\nallowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\r\ndelirium or death would have been my portion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\r\nwas happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\r\nhateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\r\nwhich had belonged to my mother, and departed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\r\ntraversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\r\nwhich travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\r\nhave lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\r\nthe sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\r\nnot die and leave my adversary in being.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\r\nmight trace the steps of my fiendish enemy.  But my plan was unsettled,\r\nand I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\r\nwhat path I should pursue.  As night approached I found myself at the\r\nentrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\r\nreposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\r\ngraves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\r\nwere gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\r\nscene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\r\nobserver.  The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\r\ncast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\r\nmourner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\r\nrage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\r\nand to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\r\nand kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\r\nsacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\r\ndeep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\r\nspirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\r\nuntil he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\r\npreserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\r\nand tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\r\neyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\r\nministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\r\nand hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\r\ntorments me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\r\nthat the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\r\nthe furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\r\nlaugh.  It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\r\nit, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\r\nSurely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\r\ndestroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\r\nwas reserved for vengeance.  The laughter died away, when a well-known\r\nand abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\r\naudible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch!  You have\r\ndetermined to live, and I am satisfied.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\r\neluded my grasp.  Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\r\nfull upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\r\nmortal speed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a\r\nslight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly.  The\r\nblue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\r\nenter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea.  I\r\ntook my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAmidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\r\nhave ever followed in his track.  Sometimes the peasants, scared by\r\nthis horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\r\nwho feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\r\nleft some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw\r\nthe print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering\r\non life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\r\nwhat I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the\r\nleast pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\r\nand carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\r\nfollowed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\r\nextricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,\r\nwhen nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\r\nwas prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The\r\nfare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\r\nI will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\r\ninvoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\r\nI was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\r\nfew drops that revived me, and vanish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\r\ngenerally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\r\ncountry chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom\r\nseen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\r\npath.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\r\nby distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\r\nwhich, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\r\nprovided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\r\nsleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\r\nmiserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\r\nspirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\r\nhappiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\r\nthis respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\r\nsustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\r\nfriends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\r\ncountenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\r\nvoice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\r\na toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\r\ncome and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\r\nfriends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\r\ntheir dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\r\npersuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\r\nburned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\r\ndestruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\r\nmechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\r\nardent desire of my soul.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\r\nleft marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\r\nme and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\r\nover”—these words were legible in one of these\r\ninscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\r\nseek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\r\ncold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\r\nyou follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\r\nenemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\r\nhours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nScoffing devil!  Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\r\nmiserable fiend, to torture and death.  Never will I give up my search\r\nuntil he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\r\nElizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\r\nreward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\r\ncold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\r\nshut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\r\nseize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\r\nseek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\r\nprocured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\r\ninscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\r\nonly begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\r\nupon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\r\nhatred.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\r\nresolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\r\nme, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\r\nuntil the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\r\nof the horizon.  Oh!  How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\r\nsouth!  Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\r\nits superior wildness and ruggedness.  The Greeks wept for joy when\r\nthey beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\r\nrapture the boundary of their toils.  I did not weep, but I knelt down\r\nand with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\r\nsafety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,\r\nto meet and grapple with him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\r\ntraversed the snows with inconceivable speed.  I know not whether the\r\nfiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\r\ndaily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\r\nwhen I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\r\nI hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach.  With new\r\ncourage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\r\nhamlet on the seashore.  I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\r\nfiend and gained accurate information.  A gigantic monster, they said,\r\nhad arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\r\nputting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\r\nhis terrific appearance.  He had carried off their store of winter\r\nfood, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\r\nnumerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\r\nnight, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\r\njourney across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\r\nconjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\r\nice or frozen by the eternal  frosts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\r\nHe had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\r\njourney across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\r\nof the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\r\ngenial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive.  Yet at the idea\r\nthat the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\r\nreturned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\r\nAfter a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\r\nround and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\r\nthe Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\r\ndeparted from land.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\r\nmisery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\r\nburning within my heart could have enabled me to support.  Immense and\r\nrugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\r\nthe thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction.  But\r\nagain the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\r\nI had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\r\nof hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\r\ndespondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured\r\nher prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after\r\nthe poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\r\nsummit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\r\ndied, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\r\ncaught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to\r\ndiscover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\r\ndistinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\r\nform within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\r\nWarm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\r\nnot intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\r\ndimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\r\noppressed me, I wept aloud.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\r\ndead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\r\nhour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\r\nirksome to me, I continued my route.  The sledge was still visible, nor\r\ndid I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\r\ntime some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags.  I indeed\r\nperceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\r\nbeheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\r\nme.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\r\nsuddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\r\never done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\r\nthe waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\r\nand terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\r\nand, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\r\ntremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\r\nminutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\r\ndrifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\r\nthus preparing for me a hideous death.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\r\nmyself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\r\nvessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\r\nI had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\r\nat the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\r\nby these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\r\nthe direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\r\nstill to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\r\npurpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\r\nmy enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\r\nvigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\r\nhardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOh!  When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow\r\nme the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live?  If I do,\r\nswear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\r\nand satisfy my vengeance in his death.  And do I dare to ask of you to\r\nundertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\r\nNo; I am not so selfish.  Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\r\nthe ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\r\nshall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\r\nwoes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes.  He is eloquent\r\nand persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\r\ntrust him not.  His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\r\nand fiend-like malice.  Hear him not; call on the names of William,\r\nJustine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\r\nthrust your sword into his heart.  I will hover near and direct the\r\nsteel aright.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter2\">\r\nWalton, <i>in continuation.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nAugust 26th, 17—.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nYou have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\r\nfeel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\r\nmine?  Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\r\ntale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\r\ndifficulty the words so replete with anguish.  His fine and lovely eyes\r\nwere now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\r\nand quenched in infinite wretchedness.  Sometimes he commanded his\r\ncountenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\r\ntranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\r\nvolcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\r\nof the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\r\nyet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\r\nand the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\r\ngreater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\r\nhowever earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\r\nI cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\r\nendeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\r\ncreature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\r\nsenseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\r\nworld a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\r\nto increase your own.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\r\nto see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\r\nbut principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\r\nwith his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\r\nhe, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\r\nposterity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\r\ntale that ever imagination formed.  My thoughts and every feeling of my\r\nsoul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\r\nand his own elevated and gentle manners have created.  I wish to soothe\r\nhim, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\r\nevery hope of consolation, to live?  Oh, no!  The only joy that he can\r\nnow know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\r\ndeath.  Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\r\ndelirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\r\nfriends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\r\nexcitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\r\nfancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\r\nremote world.  This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\r\nthem to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur conversations are not always confined to his own history and\r\nmisfortunes.  On every point of general literature he displays\r\nunbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension.  His\r\neloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\r\na pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\r\nwithout tears.  What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\r\nof his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin!  He seems\r\nto feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\r\nsome great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\r\nof judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\r\nthe worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\r\nfor I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\r\nmight be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\r\ncompleted, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\r\nanimal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\r\nthis thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\r\nserves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\r\nare as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\r\nchained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\r\nanalysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\r\nconceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\r\nrecollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\r\nheaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\r\nof their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\r\nambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\r\nwas, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\r\nrarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\r\nnever, never again to rise.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMust I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\r\nsought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\r\nseas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\r\nvalue and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\r\nmiserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\r\naffections, think you that any can replace those who are gone?  Can any\r\nman be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth?  Even\r\nwhere the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\r\nthe companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\r\nminds which hardly any later friend can obtain.  They know our\r\ninfantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\r\nare never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\r\ncertain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives.  A sister or a\r\nbrother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\r\nsuspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\r\nhowever strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\r\ncontemplated with suspicion.  But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\r\nthrough habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\r\nI am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\r\nClerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\r\nfeeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life.  If I\r\nwere engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\r\nutility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it.  But\r\nsuch is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\r\ngave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\nMy beloved Sister,\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nSeptember 2d.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\r\ndoomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\r\nit.  I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\r\nthreaten every moment to crush my vessel.  The brave fellows whom I\r\nhave persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\r\nnone to bestow.  There is something terribly appalling in our\r\nsituation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me.  Yet it is\r\nterrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\r\nthrough me.  If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\r\ndestruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\r\nyou will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\r\nbeloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\r\nin prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\r\nand lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion.  He\r\nendeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\r\nwhich he valued.  He reminds me how often the same accidents have\r\nhappened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\r\nof myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries.  Even the sailors feel\r\nthe power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\r\nrouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\r\nvast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\r\nresolutions of man.  These feelings are transitory; each day of\r\nexpectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\r\ncaused by this despair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nSeptember 5th.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\r\nhighly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\r\nforbear recording it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\r\nof being crushed in their conflict.  The cold is excessive, and many of\r\nmy unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\r\ndesolation.  Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\r\nstill glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\r\nroused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\r\nlifelessness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\r\nThis morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\r\neyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\r\na dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin.  They\r\nentered, and their leader addressed me.  He told me that he and his\r\ncompanions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\r\nto me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\r\nWe were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\r\nfeared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\r\npassage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\r\nlead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\r\nthis.  They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\r\npromise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\r\ncourse southwards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis speech troubled me.  I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\r\nthe idea of returning if set free.  Yet could I, in justice, or even in\r\npossibility, refuse this demand?  I hesitated before I answered, when\r\nFrankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\r\nto have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\r\nand his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour.  Turning towards the men,\r\nhe said,\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\r\nso easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\r\nexpedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\r\nsmooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\r\nterror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\r\nand your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\r\nthese you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\r\nwas it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\r\nbenefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\r\nwho encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\r\nbehold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\r\nmighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\r\nto be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\r\nperil; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\r\nfiresides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\r\nthus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\r\nyourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\r\npurposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\r\nhearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\r\nshall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\r\nmarked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\r\nwho know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\r\nin his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\r\nyou wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\r\nunable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\r\nbeen said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\r\ndesired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\r\nwould return.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\r\nalmost deprived of life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\r\nreturn shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled.  Yet I fear such will be my\r\nfate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\r\nwillingly continue to endure their present hardships.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nSeptember 7th.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\r\nThus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\r\nignorant and disappointed.  It requires more philosophy than I possess\r\nto bear this injustice with patience.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nSeptember 12th.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is past; I am returning to England.  I have lost my hopes of utility\r\nand glory; I have lost my friend.  But I will endeavour to detail these\r\nbitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\r\ntowards England and towards you, I will not despond.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeptember 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\r\nat a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\r\nin the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\r\nattention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\r\nsuch a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\r\nbehind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\r\nthe west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\r\nfree. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\r\ncountry was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\r\nloud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\r\ncause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\r\nwill soon return to England.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you, then, really return?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alas!  Yes; I cannot withstand their demands.  I cannot lead them\r\nunwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do so, if you will; but I will not.  You may give up your purpose, but\r\nmine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not.  I am weak, but\r\nsurely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\r\nsufficient strength.”  Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\r\nbed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\r\nentirely extinct.  At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\r\ndifficulty and was unable to speak.  The surgeon gave him a composing\r\ndraught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\r\ntold me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\r\nby his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\r\npresently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\r\nsaid, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\r\nsoon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\r\nnot, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\r\nhatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\r\njustified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\r\nhave been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\r\nIn a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\r\nbound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\r\nwell-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\r\nthat. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\r\nmy attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\r\nmisery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\r\ncreate a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\r\nand selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\r\nbeings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\r\nknow where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\r\nrender no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\r\nmine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\r\nasked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\r\nwhen I am only induced by reason and virtue.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\r\nthis task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\r\nlittle chance of meeting with him.  But the consideration of these\r\npoints, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\r\nleave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\r\napproach of death.  I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\r\nmay still be misled by passion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\r\nother respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\r\nonly happy one which I have enjoyed for several years.  The forms of\r\nthe beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms.  Farewell,\r\nWalton!  Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\r\nbe only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\r\nscience and discoveries.  Yet why do I say this?  I have myself been\r\nblasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\r\neffort, he sank into silence.  About half an hour afterwards he\r\nattempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\r\nhis eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\r\naway from his lips.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMargaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\r\nglorious spirit?  What can I say that will enable you to understand the\r\ndepth of my sorrow?  All that I should express would be inadequate and\r\nfeeble.  My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\r\ndisappointment.  But I journey towards England, and I may there find\r\nconsolation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI am interrupted.  What do these sounds portend?  It is midnight; the\r\nbreeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir.  Again there\r\nis a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\r\nwhere the remains of Frankenstein still lie.  I must arise and examine.\r\nGood night, my sister.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGreat God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\r\nremembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\r\nit; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\r\nfinal and wonderful catastrophe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\r\nfriend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\r\ndescribe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\r\nproportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\r\nlocks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\r\napparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\r\napproach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\r\ntowards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\r\nsuch loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\r\nendeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\r\nI called on him to stay.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\r\nlifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\r\nevery feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\r\nuncontrollable passion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\r\ncrimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\r\nclose! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\r\navail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\r\nby destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\r\nme.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\r\nme the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\r\nenemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\r\napproached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\r\nface, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\r\nattempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\r\ncontinued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\r\ngathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\r\nhad listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\r\nbefore you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\r\nFrankenstein would yet have lived.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And do you dream?” said the dæmon.  “Do you think that I was then\r\ndead to agony and remorse?  He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\r\n“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh!  Not the\r\nten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\r\nlingering detail of its execution.  A frightful selfishness hurried me\r\non, while my heart was poisoned with remorse.  Think you that the\r\ngroans of Clerval were music to my ears?  My heart was fashioned to be\r\nsusceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\r\nand hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\r\ntorture such as you cannot even imagine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\r\nand overcome.  I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\r\nabhorred myself.  But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\r\nmy existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\r\nhappiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\r\nhe sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\r\nindulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\r\nindignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance.  I\r\nrecollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished.  I\r\nknew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\r\nslave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\r\ndisobey.  Yet when she died!  Nay, then I was not miserable.  I had\r\ncast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\r\ndespair.  Evil thenceforth became my good.  Urged thus far, I had no\r\nchoice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\r\nchosen.  The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\r\npassion.  And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\r\nto mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\r\npersuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\r\nfriend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\r\n“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\r\nhave made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\r\nconsumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\r\nIf he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\r\nhe become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\r\nfeel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\r\nfrom your power.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\r\n“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\r\nbe the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\r\nNo sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\r\nvirtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\r\noverflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\r\nbecome to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\r\nbitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\r\ncontent to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\r\nwell satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\r\nmy fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\r\nI falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\r\nlove me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\r\nnourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\r\ndegraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\r\nmalignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\r\nfrightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\r\ncreature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\r\nvisions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\r\nfallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\r\nhad friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\r\ncrimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\r\nhe could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\r\nwasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\r\nnot satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\r\nI desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned.  Was there no\r\ninjustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\r\nhumankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\r\nfriend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\r\nwho sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\r\nand immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\r\nabortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\r\nblood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\r\nthe helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\r\ndeath his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\r\ndevoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\r\nadmiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\r\nirremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\r\nyour abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\r\nhands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\r\nimagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\r\nwill meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\r\nis nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\r\nconsummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\r\nbut it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\r\nsacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\r\nthither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\r\ncollect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\r\nremains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\r\ncreate such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\r\nagonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\r\nunquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\r\nmore, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\r\nlonger see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\r\nfeeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\r\nhappiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\r\nopened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\r\nrustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\r\nme, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\r\ncrimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\r\ndeath?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Farewell!  I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\r\neyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\r\nand yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\r\nsatiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\r\ndidst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\r\nand if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\r\nand feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\r\nthat which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\r\nthine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\r\nwounds until death shall close them for ever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I\r\nshall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\r\nmiseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\r\nexult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\r\nwill fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\r\nwill sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\r\nFarewell.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\r\nwhich lay close to the vessel.  He was soon borne away by the waves and\r\nlost in darkness and distance.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div style=\"display:block;margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS ***</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

I mean the\r\nadventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim free and\r\nTom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn’t. It only just p’isoned him\r\nfor more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we three came back up\r\nthe river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, and the village\r\nreceived us with a torchlight procession and speeches, and everybody\r\nhurrah’d and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what Tom Sawyer had\r\nalways been hankering to be.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a while he <i>was</i> satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he tilted\r\nup his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some called him\r\nTom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust. You see he\r\nlaid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the river on a\r\nraft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went by the steamboat both ways.\r\nThe boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but land! they just knuckled to the\r\ndirt before TOM.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, I don’t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn’t\r\nbeen for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim, and\r\nkind o’ good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of his age,\r\nand about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much as thirty years\r\nhe’d been the only man in the village that had a reputation—I mean\r\na reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud of it, and\r\nit was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that\r\njourney over a million times and enjoyed it every time. And now comes along a\r\nboy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody admiring and gawking over <i>his</i>\r\ntravels, and it just give the poor old man the high strikes. It made him sick\r\nto listen to Tom, and to hear the people say “My land!” “Did\r\nyou ever!” “My goodness sakes alive!” and all such things;\r\nbut he couldn’t pull away from it, any more than a fly that’s got\r\nits hind leg fast in the molasses. And always when Tom come to a rest, the poor\r\nold cretur would chip in on <i>his</i> same old travels and work them for all\r\nthey were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn’t go for much, and\r\nit was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another innings, and then the\r\nold man again—and so on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to\r\nbeat out the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou see, Parsons’ travels happened like this: When he first got to be\r\npostmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he\r\ndidn’t know, and there wasn’t any such person in the village. Well,\r\nhe didn’t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed\r\nand stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gave him a\r\nconniption. The postage wasn’t paid on it, and that was another thing to\r\nworry about. There wasn’t any way to collect that ten cents, and he\r\nreckon’d the gov’ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe\r\nturn him out besides, when they found he hadn’t collected it. Well, at\r\nlast he couldn’t stand it any longer. He couldn’t sleep nights, he\r\ncouldn’t eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he\r\nda’sn’t ask anybody’s advice, for the very person he asked\r\nfor advice might go back on him and let the gov’ment know about the\r\nletter. He had the letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he\r\nhappened to see a person standing over the place it’d give him the cold\r\nshivers, and loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till\r\nthe town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out and\r\nbury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him and shaking\r\ntheir heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they\r\njudged he had killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn’t\r\nknow what, and if he had been a stranger they would’ve lynched him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, as I was saying, it got so he couldn’t stand it any longer; so he\r\nmade up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the President of\r\nthe United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not keeping back\r\nan atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole\r\ngov’ment, and say, “Now, there she is—do with me what\r\nyou’re a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and\r\nnot deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family\r\nthat must starve and yet hadn’t had a thing to do with it, which is the\r\nwhole truth and I can swear to it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching,\r\nbut all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get\r\nto Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was\r\ngone ’most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the\r\nvillage as he when he got back. His travels made him the greatest man in all\r\nthat region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty\r\nmiles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to\r\nlook at him—and there they’d stand and gawk, and he’d gabble.\r\nYou never see anything like it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, there wasn’t any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler;\r\nsome said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed that Nat had seen\r\nthe most longitude, but they had to give in that whatever Tom was short in\r\nlongitude he had made up in latitude and climate. It was about a stand-off; so\r\nboth of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures, and try to get ahead\r\n<i>that</i> way. That bullet-wound in Tom’s leg was a tough thing for Nat\r\nParsons to buck against, but he bucked the best he could; and at a\r\ndisadvantage, too, for Tom didn’t set still as he’d orter done, to\r\nbe fair, but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat\r\nwas painting up the adventure that <i>he</i> had in Washington; for Tom never\r\nlet go that limp when his leg got well, but practiced it nights at home, and\r\nkept it good as new right along.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNat’s adventure was like this; I don’t know how true it is; maybe\r\nhe got it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he\r\n<i>did</i> know how to tell it. He could make anybody’s flesh crawl, and\r\nhe’d turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women\r\nand girls got so faint they couldn’t stick it out. Well, it was this way,\r\nas near as I can remember:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out to the\r\nPresident’s house with his letter, and they told him the President was up\r\nto the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia—not a minute to\r\nlose if he wanted to catch him. Nat ’most dropped, it made him so sick.\r\nHis horse was put up, and he didn’t know what to do. But just then along\r\ncomes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his chance. He rushes\r\nout and shouts: “A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an\r\nhour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Done!” says the darky.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and\r\na-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it was\r\nsomething awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and\r\ndeath, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air, and the\r\nbottom fell out, and when it come down Nat’s feet was on the ground, and\r\nhe see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldn’t keep up with\r\nthe hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into his work for all he was\r\nworth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly. He yelled\r\nand shouted to the driver to stop, and so did the crowds along the street, for\r\nthey could see his legs spinning along under the coach, and his head and\r\nshoulders bobbing inside through the windows, and he was in awful danger; but\r\nthe more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the\r\nhorses and shouted, “Don’t you fret, I’se gwine to git you\r\ndah in time, boss; I’s gwine to do it, sho’!” for you see he\r\nthought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, he couldn’t hear\r\nanything for the racket he was making. And so they went ripping along, and\r\neverybody just petrified to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it\r\nwas the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so. The horses\r\nlaid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all dust and rags and\r\nbarefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and caught the President and\r\ngive him the letter, and everything was all right, and the President give him a\r\nfree pardon on the spot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of\r\none, because he could see that if he hadn’t had the hack he\r\nwouldn’t’a’ got there in time, nor anywhere near it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt <i>was</i> a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his\r\nbullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, by and by Tom’s glory got to paling down gradu’ly, on account\r\nof other things turning up for the people to talk about—first a\r\nhorse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the circus,\r\nand on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same as it always\r\ndoes, and by that time there wasn’t any more talk about Tom, so to speak,\r\nand you never see a person so sick and disgusted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out, and\r\nwhen I asked him what <i>was</i> he in such a state about, he said it\r\n’most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him\r\ngetting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name\r\nfor himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is always thinking, but\r\nhe was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and pretty soon\r\nhe struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer was always free and\r\ngenerous that way. There’s a-plenty of boys that’s mighty good and\r\nfriendly when <i>you’ve</i> got a good thing, but when a good thing\r\nhappens to come their way they don’t say a word to you, and try to hog it\r\nall. That warn’t ever Tom Sawyer’s way, I can say that for him.\r\nThere’s plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you\r\nwhen you’ve got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when\r\nthey’ve got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give\r\nthem a core one time, they say thank you ’most to death, but there\r\nain’t a-going to be no core. But I notice they always git come up with;\r\nall you got to do is to wait.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was. It was\r\na crusade.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"479\" src=\"images/%7B0025%7D.jpg\" width=\"700\" id=\"id-1954438289203907264\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“We went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us\r\nwhat it was. It was a crusade.”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s a crusade?” I says.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked scornful, the way he’s always done when he was ashamed of a\r\nperson, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don’t know what a crusade\r\nis?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” says I, “I don’t. And I don’t care to,\r\nnuther. I’ve lived till now and done without it, and had my health, too.\r\nBut as soon as you tell me, I’ll know, and that’s soon enough. I\r\ndon’t see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them\r\nwhen I mayn’t ever have any occasion to use ’em. There was Lance\r\nWilliams, he learned how to talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave\r\nfor him. Now, then, what’s a crusade? But I can tell you one thing before\r\nyou begin; if it’s a patent-right, there’s no money in it. Bill\r\nThompson he—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Patent-right!” says he. “I never see such an idiot. Why, a\r\ncrusade is a kind of war.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest, and went\r\nright on, perfectly ca’m.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Which Holy Land?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, the Holy Land—there ain’t but one.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do we want of it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, can’t you understand? It’s in the hands of the paynim,\r\nand it’s our duty to take it away from them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How did we come to let them git hold of it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We didn’t come to let them git hold of it. They always had\r\nit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don’t it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why of course it does. Who said it didn’t?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI studied over it, but couldn’t seem to git at the right of it, no way. I\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine,\r\nand another person wanted it, would it be right for him to—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, shucks! you don’t know enough to come in when it rains, Huck\r\nFinn. It ain’t a farm, it’s entirely different. You see, it’s\r\nlike this. They own the land, just the mere land, and that’s all they\r\n<i>do</i> own; but it was our folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it\r\nholy, and so they haven’t any business to be there defiling it.\r\nIt’s a shame, and we ought not to stand it a minute. We ought to march\r\nagainst them and take it away from them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, it does seem to me it’s the most mixed-up thing I ever see!\r\nNow, if I had a farm and another person—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t I tell you it hasn’t got anything to do with farming?\r\nFarming is business, just common low-down business: that’s all it is,\r\nit’s all you can say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and\r\ntotally different.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly; it’s always been considered so.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim he shook his head, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, I reckon dey’s a mistake about it somers—dey\r\nmos’ sholy is. I’s religious myself, en I knows plenty religious\r\npeople, but I hain’t run across none dat acts like dat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt made Tom hot, and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, it’s enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed\r\nignorance! If either of you’d read anything about history, you’d\r\nknow that Richard Cur de Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots\r\nmore of the most noble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and\r\nhammered at the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their\r\nland away from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time—and yet\r\nhere’s a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of\r\nMissouri setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it\r\nthan they did! Talk about cheek!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and Jim felt\r\npretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn’t been quite so chipper. I\r\ncouldn’t say nothing, and Jim he couldn’t for a while; then he\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, den, I reckon it’s all right; beca’se ef dey\r\ndidn’t know, dey ain’t no use for po’ ignorant folks like us\r\nto be trying to know; en so, ef it’s our duty, we got to go en tackle it\r\nen do de bes’ we can. Same time, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars\r\nTom. De hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body hain’t been\r\n’quainted wid and dat hain’t done him no harm. Dat’s it, you\r\nsee. Ef we wuz to go ’mongst ’em, jist we three, en say we’s\r\nhungry, en ast ’em for a bite to eat, why, maybe dey’s jist like\r\nyuther people. Don’t you reckon dey is? Why, <i>dey’d</i> give it,\r\nI know dey would, en den—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then what?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain’t no use, we\r\n<i>can’t</i> kill dem po’ strangers dat ain’t doin’ us\r\nno harm, till we’ve had practice—I knows it perfectly well, Mars\r\nTom—’deed I knows it perfectly well. But ef we takes a’ axe\r\nor two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost de river to-night arter de\r\nmoon’s gone down, en kills dat sick fam’ly dat’s over on the\r\nSny, en burns dey house down, en—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, you make me tired!” says Tom. “I don’t want to\r\nargue any more with people like you and Huck Finn, that’s always\r\nwandering from the subject, and ain’t got any more sense than to try to\r\nreason out a thing that’s pure theology by the laws that protect real\r\nestate!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow that’s just where Tom Sawyer warn’t fair. Jim didn’t mean\r\nno harm, and I didn’t mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was\r\nright and we was wrong, and all we was after was to get at the <i>how</i> of\r\nit, and that was all; and the only reason he couldn’t explain it so we\r\ncould understand it was because we was ignorant—yes, and pretty dull,\r\ntoo, I ain’t denying that; but, land! that ain’t no crime, I should\r\nthink.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he wouldn’t hear no more about it—just said if we had tackled\r\nthe thing in the proper spirit, he would ’a’ raised a couple of\r\nthousand knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel, and made me a\r\nlieutenant and Jim a sutler, and took the command himself and brushed the whole\r\npaynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the world in a glory\r\nlike sunset. But he said we didn’t know enough to take the chance when we\r\nhad it, and he wouldn’t ever offer it again. And he didn’t. When he\r\nonce got set, you couldn’t budge him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I didn’t care much. I am peaceable, and don’t get up rows with\r\npeople that ain’t doing nothing to me. I allowed if the paynim was\r\nsatisfied I was, and we would let it stand at that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow Tom he got all that notion out of Walter Scott’s book, which he was\r\nalways reading. And it <i>was</i> a wild notion, because in my opinion he never\r\ncould’ve raised the men, and if he did, as like as not he would’ve\r\ngot licked. I took the book and read all about it, and as near as I could make\r\nit out, most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a mighty rocky\r\ntime of it.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0002\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER II.<br>\r\nTHE BALLOON ASCENSION</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, Tom got up one thing after another, but they all had tender spots about\r\n’em somewheres, and he had to shove ’em aside. So at last he was\r\nabout in despair. Then the St. Louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the\r\nballoon that was going to sail to Europe, and Tom sort of thought he wanted to\r\ngo down and see what it looked like, but couldn’t make up his mind. But\r\nthe papers went on talking, and so he allowed that maybe if he didn’t go\r\nhe mightn’t ever have another chance to see a balloon; and next, he found\r\nout that Nat Parsons was going down to see it, and that decided him, of course.\r\nHe wasn’t going to have Nat Parsons coming back bragging about seeing the\r\nballoon, and him having to listen to it and keep quiet. So he wanted me and Jim\r\nto go too, and we went.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a noble big balloon, and had wings and fans and all sorts of things, and\r\nwasn’t like any balloon you see in pictures. It was away out toward the\r\nedge of town, in a vacant lot, corner of Twelfth street; and there was a big\r\ncrowd around it, making fun of it, and making fun of the man,—a lean pale\r\nfeller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes, you know,—and they\r\nkept saying it wouldn’t go. It made him hot to hear them, and he would\r\nturn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind, but some\r\nday they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts\r\nup nations and makes civilizations, and was too dull to know it; and right here\r\non this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him\r\nthat would outlast a thousand years, but his name would outlast the monument.\r\nAnd then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again, and yell at him, and ask\r\nhim what was his name before he was married, and what he would take to not do\r\nit, and what was his sister’s cat’s grandmother’s name, and\r\nall the things that a crowd says when they’ve got hold of a feller that\r\nthey see they can plague. Well, some things they said <i>was</i>\r\nfunny,—yes, and mighty witty too, I ain’t denying that,—but\r\nall the same it warn’t fair nor brave, all them people pitching on one,\r\nand they so glib and sharp, and him without any gift of talk to answer back\r\nwith. But, good land! what did he want to sass back for? You see, it\r\ncouldn’t do him no good, and it was just nuts for them. They <i>had</i>\r\nhim, you know. But that was his way. I reckon he couldn’t help it; he was\r\nmade so, I judge. He was a good enough sort of cretur, and hadn’t no harm\r\nin him, and was just a genius, as the papers said, which wasn’t his\r\nfault. We can’t all be sound: we’ve got to be the way we’re\r\nmade. As near as I can make out, geniuses think they know it all, and so they\r\nwon’t take people’s advice, but always go their own way, which\r\nmakes everybody forsake them and despise them, and that is perfectly natural.\r\nIf they was humbler, and listened and tried to learn, it would be better for\r\nthem.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe part the professor was in was like a boat, and was big and roomy, and had\r\nwater-tight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in, and a\r\nbody could sit on them, and make beds on them, too. We went aboard, and there\r\nwas twenty people there, snooping around and examining, and old Nat Parsons was\r\nthere, too. The professor kept fussing around getting ready, and the people\r\nwent ashore, drifting out one at a time, and old Nat he was the last. Of course\r\nit wouldn’t do to let him go out behind <i>us</i>. We mustn’t budge\r\ntill he was gone, so we could be last ourselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he was gone now, so it was time for us to follow. I heard a big shout, and\r\nturned around—the city was dropping from under us like a shot! It made me\r\nsick all through, I was so scared. Jim turned gray and couldn’t say a\r\nword, and Tom didn’t say nothing, but looked excited. The city went on\r\ndropping down, and down, and down; but we didn’t seem to be doing nothing\r\nbut just hang in the air and stand still. The houses got smaller and smaller,\r\nand the city pulled itself together, closer and closer, and the men and wagons\r\ngot to looking like ants and bugs crawling around, and the streets like threads\r\nand cracks; and then it all kind of melted together, and there wasn’t any\r\ncity any more it was only a big scar on the earth, and it seemed to me a body\r\ncould see up the river and down the river about a thousand miles, though of\r\ncourse it wasn’t so much. By and by the earth was a ball—just a\r\nround ball, of a dull color, with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around\r\nover it, which was rivers. The Widder Douglas always told me the earth was\r\nround like a ball, but I never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions\r\no’ hers, and of course I paid no attention to that one, because I could\r\nsee myself that the world was the shape of a plate, and flat. I used to go up\r\non the hill, and take a look around and prove it for myself, because I reckon\r\nthe best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself,\r\nand not take anybody’s say-so. But I had to give in now that the widder\r\nwas right. That is, she was right as to the rest of the world, but she\r\nwarn’t right about the part our village is in; that part is the shape of\r\na plate, and flat, I take my oath!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe professor had been quiet all this time, as if he was asleep; but he broke\r\nloose now, and he was mighty bitter. He says something like this:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Idiots! They said it wouldn’t go; and they wanted to examine it,\r\nand spy around and get the secret of it out of me. But I beat them. Nobody\r\nknows the secret but me. Nobody knows what makes it move but me; and it’s\r\na new power—a new power, and a thousand times the strongest in the earth!\r\nSteam’s foolishness to it! They said I couldn’t go to Europe. To\r\nEurope! Why, there’s power aboard to last five years, and feed for three\r\nmonths. They are fools! What do they know about it? Yes, and they said my\r\nair-ship was flimsy. Why, she’s good for fifty years! I can sail the\r\nskies all my life if I want to, and steer where I please, though they laughed\r\nat that, and said I couldn’t. Couldn’t steer! Come here, boy;\r\nwe’ll see. You press these buttons as I tell you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe made Tom steer the ship all about and every which way, and learnt him the\r\nwhole thing in nearly no time; and Tom said it was perfectly easy. He made him\r\nfetch the ship down ’most to the earth, and had him spin her along so\r\nclose to the Illinois prairies that a body could talk to the farmers, and hear\r\neverything they said perfectly plain; and he flung out printed bills to them\r\nthat told about the balloon, and said it was going to Europe. Tom got so he\r\ncould steer straight for a tree till he got nearly to it, and then dart up and\r\nskin right along over the top of it. Yes, and he showed Tom how to land her;\r\nand he done it first-rate, too, and set her down in the prairies as soft as\r\nwool. But the minute we started to skip out the professor says, “No, you\r\ndon’t!” and shot her up in the air again. It was awful. I begun to\r\nbeg, and so did Jim; but it only give his temper a rise, and he begun to rage\r\naround and look wild out of his eyes, and I was scared of him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, then he got on to his troubles again, and mourned and grumbled about the\r\nway he was treated, and couldn’t seem to git over it, and especially\r\npeople’s saying his ship was flimsy. He scoffed at that, and at their\r\nsaying she warn’t simple and would be always getting out of order. Get\r\nout of order! That graveled him; he said that she couldn’t any more get\r\nout of order than the solar sister.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"444\" src=\"images/%7B0033%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-6206830924992112123\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“He said he would sail his balloon around the world”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nHe got worse and worse, and I never see a person take on so. It give me the\r\ncold shivers to see him, and so it did Jim. By and by he got to yelling and\r\nscreaming, and then he swore the world shouldn’t ever have his secret at\r\nall now, it had treated him so mean. He said he would sail his balloon around\r\nthe globe just to show what he could do, and then he would sink it in the sea,\r\nand sink us all along with it, too. Well, it was the awfulest fix to be in, and\r\nhere was night coming on!\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0037%7D.jpg\" width=\"522\" id=\"id-7823659805463664565\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“And here was night coming on!”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nHe give us something to eat, and made us go to the other end of the boat, and\r\nhe laid down on a locker, where he could boss all the works, and put his old\r\npepper-box revolver under his head, and said if anybody come fooling around\r\nthere trying to land her, he would kill him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe set scrunched up together, and thought considerable, but didn’t say\r\nmuch—only just a word once in a while when a body had to say something or\r\nbust, we was so scared and worried. The night dragged along slow and lonesome.\r\nWe was pretty low down, and the moonshine made everything soft and pretty, and\r\nthe farmhouses looked snug and homeful, and we could hear the farm sounds, and\r\nwished we could be down there; but, laws! we just slipped along over them like\r\na ghost, and never left a track.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAway in the night, when all the sounds was late sounds, and the air had a late\r\nfeel, and a late smell, too—about a two-o’clock feel, as near as I\r\ncould make out—Tom said the professor was so quiet this time he must be\r\nasleep, and we’d better—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Better what?” I says in a whisper, and feeling sick all over,\r\nbecause I knowed what he was thinking about.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Better slip back there and tie him, and land the ship,” he says.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says: “No, sir! Don’ you budge, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd Jim—well, Jim was kind o’ gasping, he was so scared. He says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Mars Tom, <i>don’t!</i> Ef you teches him, we’s\r\ngone—we’s gone sho’! I ain’t gwine anear him, not for\r\nnothin’ in dis worl’. Mars Tom, he’s plumb crazy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom whispers and says—“That’s <i>why</i> we’ve got to\r\ndo something. If he wasn’t crazy I wouldn’t give shucks to be\r\nanywhere but here; you couldn’t hire me to get out—now that\r\nI’ve got used to this balloon and over the scare of being cut loose from\r\nthe solid ground—if he was in his right mind. But it’s no good\r\npolitics, sailing around like this with a person that’s out of his head,\r\nand says he’s going round the world and then drown us all. We’ve\r\n<i>got</i> to do something, I tell you, and do it before he wakes up, too, or\r\nwe mayn’t ever get another chance. Come!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it, and we said we\r\nwouldn’t budge. So Tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if\r\nhe couldn’t get at the steering-gear and land the ship. We begged and\r\nbegged him not to, but it warn’t no use; so he got down on his hands and\r\nknees, and begun to crawl an inch at a time, we a-holding our breath and\r\nwatching. After he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than ever, and\r\nit did seem like years to me. But at last we see him get to the\r\nprofessor’s head, and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his\r\nface and listen. Then we see him begin to inch along again toward the\r\nprofessor’s feet where the steering-buttons was. Well, he got there all\r\nsafe, and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons, but he knocked down\r\nsomething that made a noise, and we see him slump down flat an’ soft in\r\nthe bottom, and lay still. The professor stirred, and says, “What’s\r\nthat?” But everybody kept dead still and quiet, and he begun to mutter\r\nand mumble and nestle, like a person that’s going to wake up, and I\r\nthought I was going to die, I was so worried and scared.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen a cloud slid over the moon, and I ’most cried, I was so glad. She\r\nburied herself deeper and deeper into the cloud, and it got so dark we\r\ncouldn’t see Tom. Then it began to sprinkle rain, and we could hear the\r\nprofessor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather. We was\r\nafraid every minute he would touch Tom, and then we would be goners, and no\r\nhelp; but Tom was already on his way back, and when we felt his hands on our\r\nknees my breath stopped sudden, and my heart fell down ’mongst my other\r\nworks, because I couldn’t tell in the dark but it might be the professor!\r\nwhich I thought it <i>was</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDear! I was so glad to have him back that I was just as near happy as a person\r\ncould be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man. You can’t\r\nland a balloon in the dark, and so I hoped it would keep on raining, for I\r\ndidn’t want Tom to go meddling any more and make us so awful\r\nuncomfortable. Well, I got my wish. It drizzled and drizzled along the rest of\r\nthe night, which wasn’t long, though it did seem so; and at daybreak it\r\ncleared, and the world looked mighty soft and gray and pretty, and the forests\r\nand fields so good to see again, and the horses and cattle standing sober and\r\nthinking. Next, the sun come a-blazing up gay and splendid, and then we began\r\nto feel rusty and stretchy, and first we knowed we was all asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0003\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER III.<br>\r\nTOM EXPLAINS</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went to sleep about four o’clock, and woke up about eight. The\r\nprofessor was setting back there at his end, looking glum. He pitched us some\r\nbreakfast, but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass. That was about\r\nthe middle of the boat. Well, when you are sharp-set, and you eat and satisfy\r\nyourself, everything looks pretty different from what it done before. It makes\r\na body feel pretty near comfortable, even when he is up in a balloon with a\r\ngenius. We got to talking together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was one thing that kept bothering me, and by and by I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom, didn’t we start east?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How fast have we been going?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, you heard what the professor said when he was raging round.\r\nSometimes, he said, we was making fifty miles an hour, sometimes ninety,\r\nsometimes a hundred; said that with a gale to help he could make three hundred\r\nany time, and said if he wanted the gale, and wanted it blowing the right\r\ndirection, he only had to go up higher or down lower to find it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, it’s just as I reckoned. The professor lied.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because if we was going so fast we ought to be past Illinois,\r\noughtn’t we?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, we ain’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the reason we ain’t?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know by the color. We’re right over Illinois yet. And you can\r\nsee for yourself that Indiana ain’t in sight.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wonder what’s the matter with you, Huck. You know by the\r\n<i>color?</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, of course I do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the color got to do with it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s got everything to do with it. Illinois is green, Indiana is\r\npink. You show me any pink down here, if you can. No, sir; it’s\r\ngreen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Indiana <i>pink?</i> Why, what a lie!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It ain’t no lie; I’ve seen it on the map, and it’s\r\npink.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou never see a person so aggravated and disgusted. He says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, if I was such a numbskull as you, Huck Finn, I would jump over.\r\nSeen it on the map! Huck Finn, did you reckon the States was the same color\r\nout-of-doors as they are on the map?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, what’s a map for? Ain’t it to learn you\r\nfacts?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, how’s it going to do that if it tells lies?\r\nThat’s what I want to know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shucks, you muggins! It don’t tell lies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It don’t, don’t it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, it don’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, then; if it don’t, there ain’t no two States the\r\nsame color. You git around <i>that</i> if you can, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe see I had him, and Jim see it too; and I tell you, I felt pretty good, for\r\nTom Sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of. Jim slapped his leg and\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I tell <i>you!</i> dat’s smart, dat’s right down smart.\r\nAin’t no use, Mars Tom; he got you <i>dis</i> time, sho’!” He\r\nslapped his leg again, and says, “My <i>lan</i>’, but it was smart\r\none!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI never felt so good in my life; and yet I didn’t know I was saying\r\nanything much till it was out. I was just mooning along, perfectly careless,\r\nand not expecting anything was going to happen, and never <i>thinking</i> of\r\nsuch a thing at all, when, all of a sudden, out it came. Why, it was just as\r\nmuch a surprise to me as it was to any of them. It was just the same way it is\r\nwhen a person is munching along on a hunk of corn-pone, and not thinking about\r\nanything, and all of a sudden bites into a di’mond. Now all that\r\n<i>he</i> knows first off is that it’s some kind of gravel he’s bit\r\ninto; but he don’t find out it’s a di’mond till he gits it\r\nout and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another, and has a\r\nlook at it, and then he’s surprised and glad—yes, and proud too;\r\nthough when you come to look the thing straight in the eye, he ain’t\r\nentitled to as much credit as he would ’a’ been if he’d been\r\n<i>hunting</i> di’monds. You can see the difference easy if you think it\r\nover. You see, an accident, that way, ain’t fairly as big a thing as a\r\nthing that’s done a-purpose. Anybody could find that di’mond in\r\nthat corn-pone; but mind you, it’s got to be somebody that’s got\r\n<i>that kind of a corn-pone</i>. That’s where that feller’s credit\r\ncomes in, you see; and that’s where mine comes in. I don’t claim no\r\ngreat things—I don’t reckon I could ’a’ done it\r\nagain—but I done it that time; that’s all I claim. And I\r\nhadn’t no more idea I could do such a thing, and warn’t any more\r\nthinking about it or trying to, than you be this minute. Why, I was just as\r\nca’m, a body couldn’t be any ca’mer, and yet, all of a\r\nsudden, out it come. I’ve often thought of that time, and I can remember\r\njust the way everything looked, same as if it was only last week. I can see it\r\nall: beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and\r\nhundreds of miles all around, and towns and villages scattered everywheres\r\nunder us, here and there and yonder; and the professor mooning over a chart on\r\nhis little table, and Tom’s cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung\r\nup to dry. And one thing in particular was a bird right alongside, not ten foot\r\noff, going our way and trying to keep up, but losing ground all the time; and a\r\nrailroad train doing the same thing down there, sliding among the trees and\r\nfarms, and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little\r\npuff of white; and when the white was gone so long you had almost forgot it,\r\nyou would hear a little faint toot, and that was the whistle. And we left the\r\nbird and the train both behind, ’<i>way</i> behind, and done it easy,\r\ntoo.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom he was huffy, and said me and Jim was a couple of ignorant\r\nblatherskites, and then he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Suppose there’s a brown calf and a big brown dog, and an artist is\r\nmaking a picture of them. What is the <i>main</i> thing that that artist has\r\ngot to do? He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute you\r\nlook at them, hain’t he? Of course. Well, then, do you want him to go and\r\npaint <i>both</i> of them brown? Certainly you don’t. He paints one of\r\nthem blue, and then you can’t make no mistake. It’s just the same\r\nwith the maps. That’s why they make every State a different color; it\r\nain’t to deceive you, it’s to keep you from deceiving\r\nyourself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I couldn’t see no argument about that, and neither could Jim. Jim\r\nshook his head, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Mars Tom, if you knowed what chuckle-heads dem painters is,\r\nyou’d wait a long time before you’d fetch one er <i>dem</i> in to\r\nback up a fac’. I’s gwine to tell you, den you kin see for\r\nyou’self. I see one of ’em a-paintin’ away, one day, down in\r\nole Hank Wilson’s back lot, en I went down to see, en he was\r\npaintin’ dat old brindle cow wid de near horn gone—you knows de one\r\nI means. En I ast him what he’s paintin’ her for, en he say when he\r\ngit her painted, de picture’s wuth a hundred dollars. Mars Tom, he could\r\na got de cow fer fifteen, en I tole him so. Well, sah, if you’ll\r\nb’lieve me, he jes’ shuck his head, dat painter did, en went on\r\na-dobbin’. Bless you, Mars Tom, <i>dey</i> don’t know\r\nnothin’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom lost his temper. I notice a person ’most always does that’s got\r\nlaid out in an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we’d feel\r\nbetter. Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the glass\r\nand looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, and then at the clock,\r\nand then at the turnip again, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’s funny! That clock’s near about an hour fast.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo he put up his turnip. Then he see another clock, and took a look, and it was\r\nan hour fast too. That puzzled him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’s a mighty curious thing,” he says. “I\r\ndon’t understand it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he took the glass and hunted up another clock, and sure enough it was an\r\nhour fast too. Then his eyes began to spread and his breath to come out kinder\r\ngaspy like, and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ger-reat Scott, it’s the <i>longitude!</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says, considerably scared:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, what’s been and gone and happened now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, the thing that’s happened is that this old bladder has slid\r\nover Illinois and Indiana and Ohio like nothing, and this is the east end of\r\nPennsylvania or New York, or somewheres around there.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, you don’t mean it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I do, and it’s dead sure. We’ve covered about fifteen\r\ndegrees of longitude since we left St. Louis yesterday afternoon, and them\r\nclocks are right. We’ve come close on to eight hundred miles.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI didn’t believe it, but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back\r\njust the same. In my experience I knowed it wouldn’t take much short of\r\ntwo weeks to do it down the Mississippi on a raft. Jim was working his mind and\r\nstudying. Pretty soon he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, did you say dem clocks uz right?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, they’re right.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ain’t yo’ watch right, too?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She’s right for St. Louis, but she’s an hour wrong for\r\nhere.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, is you tryin’ to let on dat de time ain’t de\r\n<i>same</i> everywheres?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, it ain’t the same everywheres, by a long shot.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim looked distressed, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It grieves me to hear you talk like dat, Mars Tom; I’s right down\r\nashamed to hear you talk like dat, arter de way you’s been raised.\r\nYassir, it’d break yo’ Aunt Polly’s heart to hear you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom was astonished. He looked Jim over wondering, and didn’t say nothing,\r\nand Jim went on:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, who put de people out yonder in St. Louis? De Lord done it.\r\nWho put de people here whar we is? De Lord done it. Ain’ dey bofe his\r\nchildren? ’Cose dey is. <i>Well</i>, den! is he gwine to\r\n<i>scriminate</i> ’twixt ’em?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Scriminate! I never heard such ignorance. There ain’t no\r\ndiscriminating about it. When he makes you and some more of his children black,\r\nand makes the rest of us white, what do you call that?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim see the p’int. He was stuck. He couldn’t answer. Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He does discriminate, you see, when he wants to; but this case\r\n<i>here</i> ain’t no discrimination of his, it’s man’s. The\r\nLord made the day, and he made the night; but he didn’t invent the hours,\r\nand he didn’t distribute them around. Man did that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, is dat so? Man done it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who tole him he could?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nobody. He never asked.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim studied a minute, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, dat do beat me. I wouldn’t ’a’ tuck no sich\r\nresk. But some people ain’t scared o’ nothin’. Dey bangs\r\nright ahead; <i>dey</i> don’t care what happens. So den dey’s\r\nallays an hour’s diff’unce everywhah, Mars Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“An hour? No! It’s four minutes difference for every degree of\r\nlongitude, you know. Fifteen of ’em’s an hour, thirty of\r\n’em’s two hours, and so on. When it’s one clock Tuesday\r\nmorning in England, it’s eight o’clock the night before in New\r\nYork.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim moved a little way along the locker, and you could see he was insulted. He\r\nkept shaking his head and muttering, and so I slid along to him and patted him\r\non the leg, and petted him up, and got him over the worst of his feelings, and\r\nthen he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom talkin’ sich talk as dat! Choosday in one place en Monday\r\nin t’other, bofe in the same day! Huck, dis ain’t no place to\r\njoke—up here whah we is. Two days in one day! How you gwine to get two\r\ndays inter one day? Can’t git two hours inter one hour, kin you?\r\nCan’t git two niggers inter one nigger skin, kin you? Can’t git two\r\ngallons of whisky inter a one-gallon jug, kin you? No, sir, ’twould\r\nstrain de jug. Yes, en even den you couldn’t, I don’t believe. Why,\r\nlooky here, Huck, s’posen de Choosday was New Year’s—now den!\r\nis you gwine to tell me it’s dis year in one place en las’ year in\r\nt’other, bofe in de identical same minute? It’s de beatenest\r\nrubbage! I can’t stan’ it—I can’t stan’ to hear\r\ntell ’bout it.” Then he begun to shiver and turn gray, and Tom\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Now</i> what’s the matter? What’s the trouble?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim could hardly speak, but he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, you ain’t jokin’, en it’s <i>so?</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, I’m not, and it is so.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim shivered again, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Den dat Monday could be de las’ day, en dey wouldn’t be no\r\nlas’ day in England, en de dead wouldn’t be called. We\r\nmustn’t go over dah, Mars Tom. Please git him to turn back; I wants to be\r\nwhah—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll of a sudden we see something, and all jumped up, and forgot everything and\r\nbegun to gaze. Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ain’t that the—” He catched his breath, then says:\r\n“It <i>is</i>, sure as you live! It’s the ocean!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we all stood petrified but\r\nhappy, for none of us had ever seen an ocean, or ever expected to. Tom kept\r\nmuttering:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Atlantic Ocean—Atlantic. Land, don’t it sound great! And\r\nthat’s <i>it</i>—and <i>we</i> are looking at it—we! Why,\r\nit’s just too splendid to believe!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we see a big bank of black smoke; and when we got nearer, it was a\r\ncity—and a monster she was, too, with a thick fringe of ships around one\r\nedge; and we wondered if it was New York, and begun to jaw and dispute about\r\nit, and, first we knowed, it slid from under us and went flying behind, and\r\nhere we was, out over the very ocean itself, and going like a cyclone. Then we\r\nwoke up, I tell you!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe made a break aft and raised a wail, and begun to beg the professor to turn\r\nback and land us, but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back, and we\r\nwent, but nobody will ever know how bad we felt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe land was gone, all but a little streak, like a snake, away off on the edge\r\nof the water, and down under us was just ocean, ocean, ocean—millions of\r\nmiles of it, heaving and pitching and squirming, and white sprays blowing from\r\nthe wave-tops, and only a few ships in sight, wallowing around and laying over,\r\nfirst on one side and then on t’other, and sticking their bows under and\r\nthen their sterns; and before long there warn’t no ships at all, and we\r\nhad the sky and the whole ocean all to ourselves, and the roomiest place I ever\r\nsee and the lonesomest.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0004\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER IV.<br>\r\nSTORM</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd it got lonesomer and lonesomer. There was the big sky up there, empty and\r\nawful deep; and the ocean down there without a thing on it but just the waves.\r\nAll around us was a ring, where the sky and the water come together; yes, a\r\nmonstrous big ring it was, and we right in the dead center of it—plumb in\r\nthe center. We was racing along like a prairie fire, but it never made any\r\ndifference, we couldn’t seem to git past that center no way. I\r\ncouldn’t see that we ever gained an inch on that ring. It made a body\r\nfeel creepy, it was so curious and unaccountable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very low voice,\r\nand kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky, till at\r\nlast the talk ran dry altogether, and we just set there and\r\n“thunk,” as Jim calls it, and never said a word the longest time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe professor never stirred till the sun was overhead, then he stood up and put\r\na kind of triangle to his eye, and Tom said it was a sextant and he was taking\r\nthe sun to see whereabouts the balloon was. Then he ciphered a little and\r\nlooked in a book, and then he begun to carry on again. He said lots of wild\r\nthings, and, among others, he said he would keep up this hundred-mile gait till\r\nthe middle of to-morrow afternoon, and then he’d land in London.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0049%7D.jpg\" width=\"471\" id=\"id-7578769868405926749\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“The professor said he would keep up this\r\nhundred-mile gait till tomorrow”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe said we would be humbly thankful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was turning away, but he whirled around when we said that, and give us a\r\nlong look of his blackest kind—one of the maliciousest and suspiciousest\r\nlooks I ever see. Then he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You want to leave me. Don’t try to deny it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0053%7D.jpg\" width=\"489\" id=\"id-6838280995772200593\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“You want to leave me. Don’t try to deny\r\nit.”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe didn’t know what to say, so we held in and didn’t say nothing at\r\nall.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe went aft and set down, but he couldn’t seem to git that thing out of\r\nhis mind. Every now and then he would rip out something about it, and try to\r\nmake us answer him, but we dasn’t.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt got lonesomer and lonesomer right along, and it did seem to me I\r\ncouldn’t stand it. It was still worse when night begun to come on. By and\r\nby Tom pinched me and whispers:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Look!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI took a glance aft, and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle. I\r\ndidn’t like the looks of that. By and by he took another drink, and\r\npretty soon he begun to sing. It was dark now, and getting black and stormy. He\r\nwent on singing, wilder and wilder, and the thunder begun to mutter, and the\r\nwind to wheeze and moan among the ropes, and altogether it was awful. It got so\r\nblack we couldn’t see him any more, and wished we couldn’t hear\r\nhim, but we could. Then he got still; but he warn’t still ten minutes\r\ntill we got suspicious, and wished he would start up his noise again, so we\r\ncould tell where he was. By and by there was a flash of lightning, and we see\r\nhim start to get up, but he staggered and fell down. We heard him scream out in\r\nthe dark:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They don’t want to go to England. All right, I’ll change the\r\ncourse. They want to leave me. I know they do. Well, they shall—and\r\n<i>now!</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI ’most died when he said that. Then he was still again—still so\r\nlong I couldn’t bear it, and it did seem to me the lightning\r\nwouldn’t <i>ever</i> come again. But at last there was a blessed flash,\r\nand there he was, on his hands and knees crawling, and not four feet from us.\r\nMy, but his eyes was terrible! He made a lunge for Tom, and says,\r\n“Overboard <i>you</i> go!” but it was already pitch-dark again, and\r\nI couldn’t see whether he got him or not, and Tom didn’t make a\r\nsound.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was another long, horrible wait; then there was a flash, and I see\r\nTom’s head sink down outside the boat and disappear. He was on the\r\nrope-ladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel. The professor let off\r\na shout and jumped for him, and straight off it was pitch-dark again, and Jim\r\ngroaned out, “Po’ Mars Tom, he’s a goner!” and made a\r\njump for the professor, but the professor warn’t there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we heard a couple of terrible screams, and then another not so loud, and\r\nthen another that was ’way below, and you could only <i>just</i> hear it;\r\nand I heard Jim say, “Po’ Mars Tom!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen it was awful still, and I reckon a person could ’a’ counted\r\nfour thousand before the next flash come. When it come I see Jim on his knees,\r\nwith his arms on the locker and his face buried in them, and he was crying.\r\nBefore I could look over the edge it was all dark again, and I was glad,\r\nbecause I didn’t want to see. But when the next flash come, I was\r\nwatching, and down there I see somebody a-swinging in the wind on the ladder,\r\nand it was Tom!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come up!” I shouts; “come up, Tom!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis voice was so weak, and the wind roared so, I couldn’t make out what\r\nhe said, but I thought he asked was the professor up there. I shouts:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, he’s down in the ocean! Come up! Can we help you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, all this in the dark.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Huck, who is you hollerin’ at?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I’m hollerin’ at Tom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Huck, how kin you act so, when you know po’ Mars\r\nTom—” Then he let off an awful scream, and flung his head and his\r\narms back and let off another one, because there was a white glare just then,\r\nand he had raised up his face just in time to see Tom’s, as white as\r\nsnow, rise above the gunnel and look him right in the eye. He thought it was\r\nTom’s ghost, you see.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom clumb aboard, and when Jim found it <i>was</i> him, and not his ghost, he\r\nhugged him, and called him all sorts of loving names, and carried on like he\r\nwas gone crazy, he was so glad. Says I:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What did you wait for, Tom? Why didn’t you come up at\r\nfirst?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I dasn’t, Huck. I knowed somebody plunged down past me, but I\r\ndidn’t know who it was in the dark. It could ’a’ been you, it\r\ncould ’a’ been Jim.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat was the way with Tom Sawyer—always sound. He warn’t coming up\r\ntill he knowed where the professor was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe storm let go about this time with all its might; and it was dreadful the\r\nway the thunder boomed and tore, and the lightning glared out, and the wind\r\nsung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down. One second you\r\ncouldn’t see your hand before you, and the next you could count the\r\nthreads in your coat-sleeve, and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching and\r\ntossing through a kind of veil of rain. A storm like that is the loveliest\r\nthing there is, but it ain’t at its best when you are up in the sky and\r\nlost, and it’s wet and lonesome, and there’s just been a death in\r\nthe family.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0057%7D.jpg\" width=\"485\" id=\"id-4377362654777467058\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“The thunder boomed, and the lightning glared, and the\r\nwind screamed in the rigging”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe set there huddled up in the bow, and talked low about the poor professor;\r\nand everybody was sorry for him, and sorry the world had made fun of him and\r\ntreated him so harsh, when he was doing the best he could, and hadn’t a\r\nfriend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from brooding his mind away and\r\ngoing deranged.

Me and\r\nJim was for turning around and going back home, but Tom allowed that by the\r\ntime daylight come, so we could see our way, we would be so far toward England\r\nthat we might as well go there, and come back in a ship, and have the glory of\r\nsaying we done it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAbout midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean, and\r\nwe begun to feel comfortable and drowsy; so we stretched out on the lockers and\r\nwent to sleep, and never woke up again till sun-up. The sea was sparkling like\r\ndi’monds, and it was nice weather, and pretty soon our things was all dry\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went aft to find some breakfast, and the first thing we noticed was that\r\nthere was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood. Then Tom\r\nwas disturbed. He says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You know what that means, easy enough. It means that somebody has got to\r\nstay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship, or she’ll\r\nwander around and go wherever the wind wants her to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” I says, “what’s she been doing\r\nsince—er—since we had the accident?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Wandering,” he says, kinder troubled—“wandering,\r\nwithout any doubt. She’s in a wind now that’s blowing her south of\r\neast. We don’t know how long that’s been going on, either.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then he p’inted her east, and said he would hold her there till we\r\nrousted out the breakfast. The professor had laid in everything a body could\r\nwant; he couldn’t ’a’ been better fixed. There wasn’t\r\nno milk for the coffee, but there was water, and everything else you could\r\nwant, and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it, and pipes and cigars and\r\nmatches; and wine and liquor, which warn’t in our line; and books, and\r\nmaps, and charts, and an accordion; and furs, and blankets, and no end of\r\nrubbish, like brass beads and brass jewelry, which Tom said was a sure sign\r\nthat he had an idea of visiting among savages. There was money, too. Yes, the\r\nprofessor was well enough fixed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter breakfast Tom learned me and Jim how to steer, and divided us all up into\r\nfour-hour watches, turn and turn about; and when his watch was out I took his\r\nplace, and he got out the professor’s papers and pens and wrote a letter\r\nhome to his aunt Polly, telling her everything that had happened to us, and\r\ndated it “<i>In the Welkin, approaching England</i>,” and folded it\r\ntogether and stuck it fast with a red wafer, and directed it, and wrote above\r\nthe direction, in big writing, “<i>From Tom Sawyer, the\r\nErronort</i>,” and said it would stump old Nat Parsons, the postmaster,\r\nwhen it come along in the mail. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, this ain’t no welkin, it’s a balloon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, now, who <i>said</i> it was a welkin, smarty?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You’ve wrote it on the letter, anyway.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What of it? That don’t mean that the balloon’s the\r\nwelkin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I thought it did. Well, then, what is a welkin?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI see in a minute he was stuck. He raked and scraped around in his mind, but he\r\ncouldn’t find nothing, so he had to say:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know, and nobody don’t know. It’s just a word,\r\nand it’s a mighty good word, too. There ain’t many that lays over\r\nit. I don’t believe there’s <i>any</i> that does.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shucks!” I says. “But what does it\r\n<i>mean?</i>—that’s the p’int.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know what it means, I tell you. It’s a word that\r\npeople uses for—for—well, it’s ornamental. They don’t\r\nput ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm, do they?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Course they don’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But they put them <i>on</i>, don’t they?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, then; that letter I wrote is a shirt, and the welkin’s\r\nthe ruffle on it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI judged that that would gravel Jim, and it did.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now, Mars Tom, it ain’t no use to talk like dat; en, moreover,\r\nit’s sinful. You knows a letter ain’t no shirt, en dey ain’t\r\nno ruffles on it, nuther. Dey ain’t no place to put ’em on; you\r\ncan’t put em on, and dey wouldn’t stay ef you did.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh <i>do</i> shut up, and wait till something’s started that you\r\nknow something about.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Mars Tom, sholy you can’t mean to say I don’t know\r\nabout shirts, when, goodness knows, I’s toted home de washin’ ever\r\nsence—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I tell you, this hasn’t got anything to do with shirts. I\r\nonly—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Mars Tom, you said yo’self dat a letter—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you want to drive me crazy? Keep still. I only used it as a\r\nmetaphor.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat word kinder bricked us up for a minute. Then Jim says—rather timid,\r\nbecause he see Tom was getting pretty tetchy:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, what is a metaphor?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A metaphor’s a—well, it’s a—a—a\r\nmetaphor’s an illustration.” He see <i>that</i> didn’t git\r\nhome, so he tried again. “When I say birds of a feather flocks together,\r\nit’s a metaphorical way of saying—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But dey <i>don’t!</i>, Mars Tom. No, sir, ’deed dey\r\ndon’t. Dey ain’t no feathers dat’s more alike den a bluebird\r\nen a jaybird, but ef you waits till you catches dem birds together,\r\nyou’ll—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, give us a rest! You can’t get the simplest little thing\r\nthrough your thick skull. Now don’t bother me any more.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was satisfied to stop. He was dreadful pleased with himself for catching\r\nTom out. The minute Tom begun to talk about birds I judged he was a goner,\r\nbecause Jim knowed more about birds than both of us put together. You see, he\r\nhad killed hundreds and hundreds of them, and that’s the way to find out\r\nabout birds. That’s the way people does that writes books about birds,\r\nand loves them so that they’ll go hungry and tired and take any amount of\r\ntrouble to find a new bird and kill it. Their name is ornithologers, and I\r\ncould have been an ornithologer myself, because I always loved birds and\r\ncreatures; and I started out to learn how to be one, and I see a bird setting\r\non a limb of a high tree, singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open,\r\nand before I thought I fired, and his song stopped and he fell straight down\r\nfrom the limb, all limp like a rag, and I run and picked him up and he was\r\ndead, and his body was warm in my hand, and his head rolled about this way and\r\nthat, like his neck was broke, and there was a little white skin over his eyes,\r\nand one little drop of blood on the side of his head; and, laws! I\r\ncouldn’t see nothing more for the tears; and I hain’t never\r\nmurdered no creature since that warn’t doing me no harm, and I\r\nain’t going to.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I was aggravated about that welkin. I wanted to know. I got the subject up\r\nagain, and then Tom explained, the best he could. He said when a person made a\r\nbig speech the newspapers said the shouts of the people made the welkin ring.\r\nHe said they always said that, but none of them ever told what it was, so he\r\nallowed it just meant outdoors and up high. Well, that seemed sensible enough,\r\nso I was satisfied, and said so. That pleased Tom and put him in a good humor\r\nagain, and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, it’s all right, then; and we’ll let bygones be\r\nbygones. I don’t know for certain what a welkin is, but when we land in\r\nLondon we’ll make it ring, anyway, and don’t you forget it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons; and said it was\r\na mighty sight finer to be Tom Sawyer the Erronort than to be Tom Sawyer the\r\nTraveler, and we would be heard of all round the world, if we pulled through\r\nall right, and so he wouldn’t give shucks to be a traveler now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nToward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land, and we felt\r\npretty good, too, and proud; and we kept watching with the glasses, like\r\nColumbus discovering America. But we couldn’t see nothing but ocean. The\r\nafternoon wasted out and the sun shut down, and still there warn’t no\r\nland anywheres. We wondered what was the matter, but reckoned it would come out\r\nall right, so we went on steering east, but went up on a higher level so we\r\nwouldn’t hit any steeples or mountains in the dark.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was my watch till midnight, and then it was Jim’s; but Tom stayed up,\r\nbecause he said ship captains done that when they was making the land, and\r\ndidn’t stand no regular watch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, when daylight come, Jim give a shout, and we jumped up and looked over,\r\nand there was the land sure enough—land all around, as far as you could\r\nsee, and perfectly level and yaller. We didn’t know how long we’d\r\nbeen over it. There warn’t no trees, nor hills, nor rocks, nor towns, and\r\nTom and Jim had took it for the sea. They took it for the sea in a dead\r\nca’m; but we was so high up, anyway, that if it had been the sea and\r\nrough, it would ’a’ looked smooth, all the same, in the night, that\r\nway.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe was all in a powerful excitement now, and grabbed the glasses and hunted\r\neverywheres for London, but couldn’t find hair nor hide of it, nor any\r\nother settlement—nor any sign of a lake or a river, either. Tom was clean\r\nbeat. He said it warn’t his notion of England; he thought England looked\r\nlike America, and always had that idea. So he said we better have breakfast,\r\nand then drop down and inquire the quickest way to London. We cut the breakfast\r\npretty short, we was so impatient. As we slanted along down, the weather began\r\nto moderate, and pretty soon we shed our furs. But it kept <i>on</i>\r\nmoderating, and in a precious little while it was ’most too moderate. We\r\nwas close down now, and just blistering!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe settled down to within thirty foot of the land—that is, it was land if\r\nsand is land; for this wasn’t anything but pure sand. Tom and me clumb\r\ndown the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs, and it felt amazing\r\ngood—that is, the stretching did, but the sand scorched our feet like hot\r\nembers. Next, we see somebody coming, and started to meet him; but we heard Jim\r\nshout, and looked around and he was fairly dancing, and making signs, and\r\nyelling. We couldn’t make out what he said, but we was scared anyway, and\r\nbegun to heel it back to the balloon. When we got close enough, we understood\r\nthe words, and they made me sick:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Run! Run fo’ yo’ life! Hit’s a lion; I kin see him\r\nthoo de glass! Run, boys; do please heel it de bes’ you kin. He’s\r\nbu’sted outen de menagerie, en dey ain’t nobody to stop him!”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"360\" src=\"images/%7B0065%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-3602590804723521004\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“Run! Run fo’ yo’ life!”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nIt made Tom fly, but it took the stiffening all out of my legs. I could only\r\njust gasp along the way you do in a dream when there’s a ghost gaining on\r\nyou.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me; and as soon\r\nas I got a foothold on it he shouted to Jim to soar away. But Jim had clean\r\nlost his head, and said he had forgot how. So Tom shinned along up and told me\r\nto follow; but the lion was arriving, fetching a most ghastly roar with every\r\nlope, and my legs shook so I dasn’t try to take one of them out of the\r\nrounds for fear the other one would give way under me.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0069%7D.jpg\" width=\"487\" id=\"id-3427112356779009423\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom was aboard by this time, and he started the balloon up a little, and\r\nstopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above\r\nground. And there was the lion, a-ripping around under me, and roaring and\r\nspringing up in the air at the ladder, and only missing it about a quarter of\r\nan inch, it seemed to me. It was delicious to be out of his reach, perfectly\r\ndelicious, and made me feel good and thankful all up one side; but I was\r\nhanging there helpless and couldn’t climb, and that made me feel\r\nperfectly wretched and miserable all down the other. It is most seldom that a\r\nperson feels so mixed like that; and it is not to be recommended, either.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom asked me what he’d better do, but I didn’t know. He asked me if\r\nI could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion behind.\r\nI said I could if he didn’t go no higher than he was now; but if he went\r\nhigher I would lose my head and fall, sure. So he said, “Take a good\r\ngrip,” and he started.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t go so fast,” I shouted. “It makes my head\r\nswim.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe had started like a lightning express. He slowed down, and we glided over the\r\nsand slower, but still in a kind of sickening way; for it <i>is</i>\r\nuncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that, and not a\r\nsound.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut pretty soon there was plenty of sound, for the lion was catching up. His\r\nnoise fetched others. You could see them coming on the lope from every\r\ndirection, and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under me,\r\njumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other; and so we\r\nwent skimming along over the sand, and these fellers doing what they could to\r\nhelp us to not forgit the occasion; and then some other beasts come, without an\r\ninvite, and they started a regular riot down there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe see this plan was a mistake. We couldn’t ever git away from them at\r\nthis gait, and I couldn’t hold on forever. So Tom took a think, and\r\nstruck another idea. That was, to kill a lion with the pepper-box revolver, and\r\nthen sail away while the others stopped to fight over the carcass. So he\r\nstopped the balloon still, and done it, and then we sailed off while the fuss\r\nwas going on, and come down a quarter of a mile off, and they helped me aboard;\r\nbut by the time we was out of reach again, that gang was on hand once more. And\r\nwhen they see we was really gone and they couldn’t get us, they sat down\r\non their hams and looked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much\r\nas a person could do not to see <i>their</i> side of the matter.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0006\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER VI.<br>\r\nIT’S A CARAVAN</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nI was so weak that the only thing I wanted was a chance to lay down, so I made\r\nstraight for my locker-bunk, and stretched myself out there. But a body\r\ncouldn’t get back his strength in no such oven as that, so Tom give the\r\ncommand to soar, and Jim started her aloft.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it was breezy\r\nand pleasant and just right, and pretty soon I was all straight again. Tom had\r\nbeen setting quiet and thinking; but now he jumps up and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I bet you a thousand to one I know where we are. We’re in the\r\nGreat Sahara, as sure as guns!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was so excited he couldn’t hold still; but I wasn’t. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, where’s the Great Sahara? In England or in\r\nScotland?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“’Tain’t in either; it’s in Africa.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim’s eyes bugged out, and he begun to stare down with no end of\r\ninterest, because that was where his originals come from; but I didn’t\r\nmore than half believe it. I couldn’t, you know; it seemed too awful far\r\naway for us to have traveled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom was full of his discovery, as he called it, and said the lions and the\r\nsand meant the Great Desert, sure. He said he could ’a’ found out,\r\nbefore we sighted land, that we was crowding the land somewheres, if he had\r\nthought of one thing; and when we asked him what, he said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“These clocks. They’re chronometers. You always read about them in\r\nsea voyages. One of them is keeping Grinnage time, and the other is keeping St.\r\nLouis time, like my watch. When we left St. Louis it was four in the afternoon\r\nby my watch and this clock, and it was ten at night by this Grinnage clock.\r\nWell, at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven o’clock. Now I\r\nnoticed the time yesterday evening when the sun went down, and it was half-past\r\nfive o’clock by the Grinnage clock, and half past 11 A.M. by my watch and\r\nthe other clock. You see, the sun rose and set by my watch in St. Louis, and\r\nthe Grinnage clock was six hours fast; but we’ve come so far east that it\r\ncomes within less than half an hour of setting by the Grinnage clock now, and\r\nI’m away out—more than four hours and a half out. You see, that\r\nmeant that we was closing up on the longitude of Ireland, and would strike it\r\nbefore long if we was p’inted right—which we wasn’t. No, sir,\r\nwe’ve been a-wandering—wandering ’way down south of east, and\r\nit’s my opinion we are in Africa. Look at this map. You see how the\r\nshoulder of Africa sticks out to the west. Think how fast we’ve traveled;\r\nif we had gone straight east we would be long past England by this time. You\r\nwatch for noon, all of you, and we’ll stand up, and when we can’t\r\ncast a shadow we’ll find that this Grinnage clock is coming mighty close\r\nto marking twelve. Yes, sir, I think we’re in Africa; and it’s just\r\nbully.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was gazing down with the glass. He shook his head and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, I reckon dey’s a mistake som’er’s,\r\nhain’t seen no niggers yit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’s nothing; they don’t live in the desert. What is that,\r\n’way off yonder? Gimme a glass.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe took a long look, and said it was like a black string stretched across the\r\nsand, but he couldn’t guess what it was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” I says, “I reckon maybe you’ve got a chance now\r\nto find out whereabouts this balloon is, because as like as not that is one of\r\nthese lines here, that’s on the map, that you call meridians of\r\nlongitude, and we can drop down and look at its number, and—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, I never see such a lunkhead as you. Did you\r\ns’pose there’s meridians of longitude on the <i>earth?</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, they’re set down on the map, and you know it perfectly\r\nwell, and here they are, and you can see for yourself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course they’re on the map, but that’s nothing; there\r\nain’t any on the <i>ground</i>.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom, do you know that to be so?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly I do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, that map’s a liar again. I never see such a liar as\r\nthat map.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe fired up at that, and I was ready for him, and Jim was warming his opinion,\r\ntoo, and next minute we’d ’a’ broke loose on another\r\nargument, if Tom hadn’t dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands\r\nlike a maniac and sing out:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Camels!—Camels!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo I grabbed a glass and Jim, too, and took a look, but I was disappointed, and\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Camels your granny; they’re spiders.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Spiders in a desert, you shad? Spiders walking in a procession? You\r\ndon’t ever reflect, Huck Finn, and I reckon you really haven’t got\r\nanything to reflect <i>with</i>. Don’t you know we’re as much as a\r\nmile up in the air, and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles\r\naway? Spiders, good land! Spiders as big as a cow? Perhaps you’d like to\r\ngo down and milk one of ’em. But they’re camels, just the same.\r\nIt’s a caravan, that’s what it is, and it’s a mile\r\nlong.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, let’s go down and look at it. I don’t believe in\r\nit, and ain’t going to till I see it and know it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right,” he says, and give the command:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Lower away.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs we come slanting down into the hot weather, we could see that it was camels,\r\nsure enough, plodding along, an everlasting string of them, with bales strapped\r\nto them, and several hundred men in long white robes, and a thing like a shawl\r\nbound over their heads and hanging down with tassels and fringes; and some of\r\nthe men had long guns and some hadn’t, and some was riding and some was\r\nwalking. And the weather—well, it was just roasting. And how slow they\r\ndid creep along! We swooped down now, all of a sudden, and stopped about a\r\nhundred yards over their heads.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0073%7D.jpg\" width=\"432\" id=\"id-1392678326932025283\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“We swooped down, now, all of a sudden”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nThe men all set up a yell, and some of them fell flat on their stomachs, some\r\nbegun to fire their guns at us, and the rest broke and scampered every which\r\nway, and so did the camels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe see that we was making trouble, so we went up again about a mile, to the\r\ncool weather, and watched them from there. It took them an hour to get together\r\nand form the procession again; then they started along, but we could see by the\r\nglasses that they wasn’t paying much attention to anything but us. We\r\npoked along, looking down at them with the glasses, and by and by we see a big\r\nsand mound, and something like people the other side of it, and there was\r\nsomething like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his head up every\r\nnow and then, and seemed to be watching the caravan or us, we didn’t know\r\nwhich. As the caravan got nearer, he sneaked down on the other side and rushed\r\nto the other men and horses—for that is what they was—and we see\r\nthem mount in a hurry; and next, here they come, like a house afire, some with\r\nlances and some with long guns, and all of them yelling the best they could.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey come a-tearing down on to the caravan, and the next minute both sides\r\ncrashed together and was all mixed up, and there was such another popping of\r\nguns as you never heard, and the air got so full of smoke you could only catch\r\nglimpses of them struggling together. There must ’a’ been six\r\nhundred men in that battle, and it was terrible to see. Then they broke up into\r\ngangs and groups, fighting tooth and nail, and scurrying and scampering around,\r\nand laying into each other like everything; and whenever the smoke cleared a\r\nlittle you could see dead and wounded people and camels scattered far and wide\r\nand all about, and camels racing off in every direction.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0077%7D.jpg\" width=\"476\" id=\"id-8635148903910165048\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“The last man to go snatched up a child, and carried\r\nit off in front of him on his horse”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last the robbers see they couldn’t win, so their chief sounded a\r\nsignal, and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering across the\r\nplain.

Then Tom took the\r\nhellum, and started for that yahoo, and we come a-whizzing down and made a\r\nswoop, and knocked him out of the saddle, child and all; and he was jarred\r\nconsiderable, but the child wasn’t hurt, but laid there working its hands\r\nand legs in the air like a tumble-bug that’s on its back and can’t\r\nturn over.

She was nearly a half a mile from her\r\npeople, so we thought we might go down to the child, which was about a quarter\r\nof a mile beyond her, and snake it to her before the caravan people could git\r\nto us to do us any harm; and besides, we reckoned they had enough business on\r\ntheir hands for one while, anyway, with the wounded. We thought we’d\r\nchance it, and we did. We swooped down and stopped, and Jim shinned down the\r\nladder and fetched up the kid, which was a nice fat little thing, and in a\r\nnoble good humor, too, considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled\r\noff of a horse; and then we started for the mother, and stopped back of her and\r\ntolerable near by, and Jim slipped down and crept up easy, and when he was\r\nclose back of her the child goo-goo’d, the way a child does, and she\r\nheard it, and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy, and made a jump for the kid\r\nand snatched it and hugged it, and dropped it and hugged Jim, and then snatched\r\noff a gold chain and hung it around Jim’s neck, and hugged him again, and\r\njerked up the child again, a-sobbing and glorifying all the time; and Jim he\r\nshoved for the ladder and up it, and in a minute we was back up in the sky and\r\nthe woman was staring up, with the back of her head between her shoulders and\r\nthe child with its arms locked around her neck.

His shadder was just a blot around\r\nhis feet. We looked, and the Grinnage clock was so close to twelve the\r\ndifference didn’t amount to nothing. So Tom said London was right north\r\nof us or right south of us, one or t’other, and he reckoned by the\r\nweather and the sand and the camels it was north; and a good many miles north,\r\ntoo; as many as from New York to the city of Mexico, he guessed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the world,\r\nunless it might be some kinds of birds—a wild pigeon, maybe, or a\r\nrailroad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom said he had read about railroads in England going nearly a hundred\r\nmiles an hour for a little ways, and there never was a bird in the world that\r\ncould do that—except one, and that was a flea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A flea? Why, Mars Tom, in de fust place he ain’t a bird, strickly\r\nspeakin’—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He ain’t a bird, eh? Well, then, what is he?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t rightly know, Mars Tom, but I speck he’s only jist\r\na’ animal. No, I reckon dat won’t do, nuther, he ain’t big\r\nenough for a’ animal. He mus’ be a bug. Yassir, dat’s what he\r\nis, he’s a bug.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I bet he ain’t, but let it go. What’s your second\r\nplace?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, in de second place, birds is creturs dat goes a long ways, but a\r\nflea don’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He don’t, don’t he? Come, now, what <i>is</i> a long\r\ndistance, if you know?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, it’s miles, and lots of ’em—anybody knows\r\ndat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can’t a man walk miles?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yassir, he kin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As many as a railroad?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yassir, if you give him time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can’t a flea?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well—I s’pose so—ef you gives him heaps of\r\ntime.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now you begin to see, don’t you, that <i>distance</i> ain’t\r\nthe thing to judge by, at all; it’s the time it takes to go the distance\r\n<i>in</i> that <i>counts</i>, ain’t it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, hit do look sorter so, but I wouldn’t ’a’\r\nb’lieved it, Mars Tom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0085%7D.jpg\" width=\"457\" id=\"id-8241351572015170795\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“And where’s your railroad, alongside of a\r\nflea?”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s a matter of <i>proportion</i>, that’s what it is; and\r\nwhen you come to gauge a thing’s speed by its size, where’s your\r\nbird and your man and your railroad, alongside of a flea? The fastest man\r\ncan’t run more than about ten miles in an hour—not much over ten\r\nthousand times his own length. But all the books says any common ordinary\r\nthird-class flea can jump a hundred and fifty times his own length; yes, and he\r\ncan make five jumps a second too—seven hundred and fifty times his own\r\nlength, in one little second—for he don’t fool away any time\r\nstopping and starting—he does them both at the same time; you’ll\r\nsee, if you try to put your finger on him. Now that’s a common, ordinary,\r\nthird-class flea’s gait; but you take an Eyetalian <i>first</i>-class,\r\nthat’s been the pet of the nobility all his life, and hasn’t ever\r\nknowed what want or sickness or exposure was, and he can jump more than three\r\nhundred times his own length, and keep it up all day, five such jumps every\r\nsecond, which is fifteen hundred times his own length. Well, suppose a man\r\ncould go fifteen hundred times his own length in a second—say, a mile and\r\na half. It’s ninety miles a minute; it’s considerable more than\r\nfive thousand miles an hour. Where’s your man <i>now?</i>—yes, and\r\nyour bird, and your railroad, and your balloon? Laws, they don’t amount\r\nto shucks ’longside of a flea.

I\r\nain’t had no respec’ for um befo’, sca’sely, but dey\r\nain’t no gittin’ roun’ it, dey do deserve it, dat’s\r\ncertain.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I bet they do. They’ve got ever so much more sense, and\r\nbrains, and brightness, in proportion to their size, than any other cretur in\r\nthe world. A person can learn them ’most anything; and they learn it\r\nquicker than any other cretur, too. They’ve been learnt to haul little\r\ncarriages in harness, and go this way and that way and t’other way\r\naccording to their orders; yes, and to march and drill like soldiers, doing it\r\nas exact, according to orders, as soldiers does it. They’ve been learnt\r\nto do all sorts of hard and troublesome things. S’pose you could\r\ncultivate a flea up to the size of a man, and keep his natural smartness\r\na-growing and a-growing right along up, bigger and bigger, and keener and\r\nkeener, in the same proportion—where’d the human race be, do you\r\nreckon? That flea would be President of the United States, and you\r\ncouldn’t any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"374\" src=\"images/%7B0093%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-6036332020506243444\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“That flea would be President of the United States,\r\nand you couldn’t prevent it”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“My lan’, Mars Tom, I never knowed dey was so much <i>to</i> de\r\nbeas’. No, sir, I never had no idea of it, and dat’s de\r\nfac’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There’s more to him, by a long sight, than there is to any other\r\ncretur, man or beast, in proportion to size. He’s the interestingest of\r\nthem all. People have so much to say about an ant’s strength, and an\r\nelephant’s, and a locomotive’s. Shucks, they don’t begin with\r\na flea. He can lift two or three hundred times his own weight. And none of them\r\ncan come anywhere near it. And, moreover, he has got notions of his own, and is\r\nvery particular, and you can’t fool him; his instinct, or his judgment,\r\nor whatever it is, is perfectly sound and clear, and don’t ever make a\r\nmistake. People think all humans are alike to a flea. It ain’t so.\r\nThere’s folks that he won’t go near, hungry or not hungry, and\r\nI’m one of them. I’ve never had one of them on me in my\r\nlife.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s so; I ain’t joking.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, sah, I hain’t ever heard de likes o’ dat\r\nbefo’.” Jim couldn’t believe it, and I couldn’t; so we\r\nhad to drop down to the sand and git a supply and see. Tom was right. They went\r\nfor me and Jim by the thousand, but not a one of them lit on Tom. There\r\nwarn’t no explaining it, but there it was and there warn’t no\r\ngetting around it. He said it had always been just so, and he’d just as\r\nsoon be where there was a million of them as not; they’d never touch him\r\nnor bother him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went up to the cold weather to freeze ’em out, and stayed a little\r\nspell, and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying along\r\ntwenty or twenty-five miles an hour, the way we’d been doing for the last\r\nfew hours. The reason was, that the longer we was in that solemn, peaceful\r\ndesert, the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us, and the\r\nmore happier and contented and satisfied we got to feeling, and the more we got\r\nto liking the desert, and then loving it. So we had cramped the speed down, as\r\nI was saying, and was having a most noble good lazy time, sometimes watching\r\nthrough the glasses, sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading, sometimes\r\ntaking a nap.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt didn’t seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find\r\nland and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that—clean over it.\r\nWe was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn’t want\r\nto be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it ’most seemed as\r\nif I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And always\r\nI had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pestering of me, and\r\nscolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, and sticking to me, and\r\nkeeping after me, and making me do this, and making me do that and\r\nt’other, and always selecting out the things I didn’t want to do,\r\nand then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else, and just\r\naggravating the life out of a body all the time; but up here in the sky it was\r\nso still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and\r\nstrange things to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good people, and\r\njust holiday all the time. Land, I warn’t in no hurry to git out and buck\r\nat civilization again. Now, one of the worst things about civilization is, that\r\nanybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it\r\nand makes you feel bad, and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of\r\neverybody all over the world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal ’most\r\nall the time, and it’s such a heavy load for a person. I hate them\r\nnewspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way I wouldn’t allow\r\nnobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ain’t acquainted with,\r\non t’other side of the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon there\r\nain’t any of that, and it’s the darlingest place there is.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had supper, and that night was one of the prettiest nights I ever see. The\r\nmoon made it just like daylight, only a heap softer; and once we see a lion\r\nstanding all alone by himself, just all alone on the earth, it seemed like, and\r\nhis shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink. That’s the kind\r\nof moonlight to have.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMainly we laid on our backs and talked; we didn’t want to go to sleep.\r\nTom said we was right in the midst of the Arabian Nights now. He said it was\r\nright along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened; so we\r\nlooked down and watched while he told about it, because there ain’t\r\nanything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked\r\nabout. It was a tale about a camel-driver that had lost his camel, and he come\r\nalong in the desert and met a man, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Have you run across a stray camel to-day?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd the man says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was he blind in his left eye?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Had he lost an upper front tooth?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was his off hind leg lame?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was he loaded with millet-seed on one side and honey on the\r\nother?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, but you needn’t go into no more details—that’s\r\nthe one, and I’m in a hurry. Where did you see him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hain’t seen him at all,” the man says.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hain’t seen him at all? How can you describe him so close,\r\nthen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because when a person knows how to use his eyes, everything has got a\r\nmeaning to it; but most people’s eyes ain’t any good to them. I\r\nknowed a camel had been along, because I seen his track. I knowed he was lame\r\nin his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it, and\r\nhis track showed it. I knowed he was blind on his left side because he only\r\nnibbled the grass on the right side of the trail. I knowed he had lost an upper\r\nfront tooth because where he bit into the sod his teeth-print showed it. The\r\nmillet-seed sifted out on one side—the ants told me that; the honey\r\nleaked out on the other—the flies told me that. I know all about your\r\ncamel, but I hain’t seen him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Go on, Mars Tom, hit’s a mighty good tale, and powerful\r\ninterestin’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’s all,” Tom says.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>All?</i>” says Jim, astonished. “What ’come\r\no’ de camel?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, don’t de tale say?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim puzzled a minute, then he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well! Ef dat ain’t de beatenes’ tale ever I struck. Jist\r\ngits to de place whah de intrust is gittin’ red-hot, en down she breaks.\r\nWhy, Mars Tom, dey ain’t no <i>sense</i> in a tale dat acts like dat.\r\nHain’t you got no <i>idea</i> whether de man got de camel back er\r\nnot?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, I haven’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI see myself there warn’t no sense in the tale, to chop square off that\r\nway before it come to anything, but I warn’t going to say so, because I\r\ncould see Tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out and the\r\nway Jim had popped on to the weak place in it, and I don’t think\r\nit’s fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when he’s down. But\r\nTom he whirls on me and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do <i>you</i> think of the tale?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, then, I had to come out and make a clean breast and say it did seem\r\nto me, too, same as it did to Jim, that as long as the tale stopped square in\r\nthe middle and never got to no place, it really warn’t worth the trouble\r\nof telling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom’s chin dropped on his breast, and ’stead of being mad, as I\r\nreckoned he’d be, to hear me scoff at his tale that way, he seemed to be\r\nonly sad; and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Some people can see, and some can’t—just as that man said.\r\nLet alone a camel, if a cyclone had gone by, <i>you</i> duffers wouldn’t\r\n’a’ noticed the track.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI don’t know what he meant by that, and he didn’t say; it was just\r\none of his irrulevances, I reckon—he was full of them, sometimes, when he\r\nwas in a close place and couldn’t see no other way out—but I\r\ndidn’t mind. We’d spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough,\r\nhe couldn’t git away from that little fact. It graveled him like the\r\nnation, too, I reckon, much as he tried not to let on.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0008\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER VIII.<br>\r\nTHE DISAPPEARING LAKE</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had an early breakfast in the morning, and set looking down on the desert,\r\nand the weather was ever so bammy and lovely, although we warn’t high up.\r\nYou have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the desert, because it\r\ncools off so fast; and so, by the time it is getting toward dawn, you are\r\nskimming along only a little ways above the sand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground, and now and\r\nthen gazing off across the desert to see if anything was stirring, and then\r\ndown on the shadder again, when all of a sudden almost right under us we see a\r\nlot of men and camels laying scattered about, perfectly quiet, like they was\r\nasleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe shut off the power, and backed up and stood over them, and then we see that\r\nthey was all dead. It give us the cold shivers. And it made us hush down, too,\r\nand talk low, like people at a funeral. We dropped down slow and stopped, and\r\nme and Tom clumb down and went among them. There was men, and women, and\r\nchildren. They was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled and leathery, like\r\nthe pictures of mummies you see in books. And yet they looked just as human,\r\nyou wouldn’t ’a’ believed it; just like they was asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome of the people and animals was partly covered with sand, but most of them\r\nnot, for the sand was thin there, and the bed was gravel and hard. Most of the\r\nclothes had rotted away; and when you took hold of a rag, it tore with a touch,\r\nlike spiderweb. Tom reckoned they had been laying there for years.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome of the men had rusty guns by them, some had swords on and had shawl belts\r\nwith long, silver-mounted pistols stuck in them. All the camels had their loads\r\non yet, but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the\r\nground. We didn’t reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any\r\nmore, so we took one apiece, and some pistols. We took a small box, too,\r\nbecause it was so handsome and inlaid so fine; and then we wanted to bury the\r\npeople; but there warn’t no way to do it that we could think of, and\r\nnothing to do it with but sand, and that would blow away again, of course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we mounted high and sailed away, and pretty soon that black spot on the\r\nsand was out of sight, and we wouldn’t ever see them poor people again in\r\nthis world. We wondered, and reasoned, and tried to guess how they come to be\r\nthere, and how it all happened to them, but we couldn’t make it out.\r\nFirst we thought maybe they got lost, and wandered around and about till their\r\nfood and water give out and they starved to death; but Tom said no wild animals\r\nnor vultures hadn’t meddled with them, and so that guess wouldn’t\r\ndo. So at last we give it up, and judged we wouldn’t think about it no\r\nmore, because it made us low-spirited.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"411\" src=\"images/%7B0101%7D.jpg\" width=\"500\" id=\"id-8501513346775859243\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“We opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we opened the box, and it had gems and jewels in it, quite a pile, and\r\nsome little veils of the kind the dead women had on, with fringes made out of\r\ncurious gold money that we warn’t acquainted with. We wondered if we\r\nbetter go and try to find them again and give it back; but Tom thought it over\r\nand said no, it was a country that was full of robbers, and they would come and\r\nsteal it; and then the sin would be on us for putting the temptation in their\r\nway. So we went on; but I wished we had took all they had, so there\r\nwouldn’t ’a’ been no temptation at all left.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had had two hours of that blazing weather down there, and was dreadful\r\nthirsty when we got aboard again. We went straight for the water, but it was\r\nspoiled and bitter, besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your mouth.\r\nWe couldn’t drink it. It was Mississippi river water, the best in the\r\nworld, and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help, but no, the\r\nmud wasn’t any better than the water. Well, we hadn’t been so very,\r\nvery thirsty before, while we was interested in the lost people, but we was\r\nnow, and as soon as we found we couldn’t have a drink, we was more than\r\nthirty-five times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before. Why, in a\r\nlittle while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom said to keep a sharp lookout, all around, everywheres, because we’d\r\ngot to find an oasis or there warn’t no telling what would happen. So we\r\ndone it. We kept the glasses gliding around all the time, till our arms got so\r\ntired we couldn’t hold them any more. Two hours—three\r\nhours—just gazing and gazing, and nothing but sand, sand, SAND, and you\r\ncould see the quivering heat-shimmer playing over it. Dear, dear, a body\r\ndon’t know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and\r\nis certain he ain’t ever going to come to any water any more. At last I\r\ncouldn’t stand it to look around on them baking plains; I laid down on\r\nthe locker, and give it up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut by and by Tom raised a whoop, and there she was! A lake, wide and shiny,\r\nwith pa’m-trees leaning over it asleep, and their shadders in the water\r\njust as soft and delicate as ever you see. I never see anything look so good.\r\nIt was a long ways off, but that warn’t anything to us; we just slapped\r\non a hundred-mile gait, and calculated to be there in seven minutes; but she\r\nstayed the same old distance away, all the time; we couldn’t seem to gain\r\non her; yes, sir, just as far, and shiny, and like a dream; but we\r\ncouldn’t get no nearer; and at last, all of a sudden, she was gone!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom’s eyes took a spread, and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Boys, it was a <i>my</i>ridge!” Said it like he was glad. I\r\ndidn’t see nothing to be glad about. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Maybe. I don’t care nothing about its name, the thing I want to\r\nknow is, what’s become of it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was trembling all over, and so scared he couldn’t speak, but he\r\nwanted to ask that question himself if he could ’a’ done it. Tom\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s <i>become</i> of it? Why, you see yourself it’s\r\ngone.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I know; but where’s it gone <i>to?</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked me over and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, now, Huck Finn, where <i>would</i> it go to! Don’t you know\r\nwhat a myridge is?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, I don’t. What is it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It ain’t anything but imagination. There ain’t anything\r\n<i>to</i> it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that, and I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the use you talking that kind of stuff, Tom Sawyer?\r\nDidn’t I see the lake?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes—you think you did.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t think nothing about it, I <i>did</i> see it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I tell you you <i>didn’t</i> see it either—because it\r\nwarn’t there to see.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt astonished Jim to hear him talk so, and he broke in and says, kind of\r\npleading and distressed:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, <i>please</i> don’t say sich things in sich an awful\r\ntime as dis. You ain’t only reskin’ yo’ own self, but\r\nyou’s reskin’ us—same way like Anna Nias en Siffra. De lake\r\n<i>wuz</i> dah—I seen it jis’ as plain as I sees you en Huck dis\r\nminute.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, he seen it himself! He was the very one that seen it first.\r\n<i>Now</i>, then!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Mars Tom, hit’s so—you can’t deny it. We all seen\r\nit, en dat <i>prove</i> it was dah.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Proves it! How does it prove it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Same way it does in de courts en everywheres, Mars Tom. One pusson might\r\nbe drunk, or dreamy or suthin’, en he could be mistaken; en two might,\r\nmaybe; but I tell you, sah, when three sees a thing, drunk er sober, it’s\r\n<i>so</i>. Dey ain’t no gittin’ aroun’ dat, en you knows it,\r\nMars Tom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know nothing of the kind. There used to be forty thousand\r\nmillion people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the other\r\nevery day. Did that prove that the sun <i>done</i> it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Course it did. En besides, dey warn’t no ’casion to prove\r\nit. A body ’at’s got any sense ain’t gwine to doubt it. Dah\r\nshe is now—a sailin’ thoo de sky, like she allays done.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom turned on me, then, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do <i>you</i> say—is the sun standing still?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, what’s the use to ask such a jackass question? Anybody\r\nthat ain’t blind can see it don’t stand still.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” he says, “I’m lost in the sky with no company\r\nbut a passel of low-down animals that don’t know no more than the head\r\nboss of a university did three or four hundred years ago.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt warn’t fair play, and I let him know it. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Throwin’ mud ain’t arguin’, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness gracious, dah’s de lake\r\nagi’n!” yelled Jim, just then. “<i>Now</i>, Mars Tom, what\r\nyou gwine to say?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, sir, there was the lake again, away yonder across the desert, perfectly\r\nplain, trees and all, just the same as it was before. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I reckon you’re satisfied now, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he says, perfectly ca’m:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, satisfied there ain’t no lake there.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Don’t!</i> talk so, Mars Tom—it sk’yers me to hear\r\nyou. It’s so hot, en you’s so thirsty, dat you ain’t in\r\nyo’ right mine, Mars Tom. Oh, but don’t she look good! ’clah\r\nI doan’ know how I’s gwine to wait tell we gits dah, I’s\r\n<i>so</i> thirsty.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, you’ll have to wait; and it won’t do you no good,\r\neither, because there ain’t no lake there, I tell you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Jim, don’t you take your eye off of it, and I won’t,\r\neither.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“’Deed I won’t; en bless you, honey, I couldn’t ef I\r\nwanted to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went a-tearing along toward it, piling the miles behind us like nothing, but\r\nnever gaining an inch on it—and all of a sudden it was gone again! Jim\r\nstaggered, and ’most fell down. When he got his breath he says, gasping\r\nlike a fish:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, hit’s a <i>ghos</i>’, dat’s what it is, en I\r\nhopes to goodness we ain’t gwine to see it no mo’. Dey’s\r\n<i>been</i> a lake, en suthin’s happened, en de lake’s dead, en\r\nwe’s seen its ghos’; we’s seen it twiste, en dat’s\r\nproof. De desert’s ha’nted, it’s ha’nted, sho; oh, Mars\r\nTom, le’ ’s git outen it; I’d ruther die den have de night\r\nketch us in it ag’in en de ghos’ er dat lake come a-mournin’\r\naroun’ us en we asleep en doan’ know de danger we’s\r\nin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ghost, you gander! It ain’t anything but air and heat and\r\nthirstiness pasted together by a person’s imagination. If I—gimme\r\nthe glass!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s a flock of birds,” he says. “It’s getting\r\ntoward sundown, and they’re making a bee-line across our track for\r\nsomewheres. They mean business—maybe they’re going for food or\r\nwater, or both. Let her go to starboard!—Port your hellum! Hard down!\r\nThere—ease up—steady, as you go.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe shut down some of the power, so as not to outspeed them, and took out after\r\nthem. We went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them, and when we had\r\nfollowed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty discouraged, and was\r\nthirsty clean to unendurableness, Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Take the glass, one of you, and see what that is, away ahead of the\r\nbirds.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim got the first glimpse, and slumped down on the locker sick. He was most\r\ncrying, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She’s dah ag’in, Mars Tom, she’s dah ag’in, en I\r\nknows I’s gwine to die, ’case when a body sees a ghos’ de\r\nthird time, dat’s what it means. I wisht I’d never come in dis\r\nballoon, dat I does.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe wouldn’t look no more, and what he said made me afraid, too, because I\r\nknowed it was true, for that has always been the way with ghosts; so then I\r\nwouldn’t look any more, either. Both of us begged Tom to turn off and go\r\nsome other way, but he wouldn’t, and said we was ignorant superstitious\r\nblatherskites. Yes, and he’ll git come up with, one of these days, I says\r\nto myself, insulting ghosts that way. They’ll stand it for a while,\r\nmaybe, but they won’t stand it always, for anybody that knows about\r\nghosts knows how easy they are hurt, and how revengeful they are.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo we was all quiet and still, Jim and me being scared, and Tom busy. By and by\r\nTom fetched the balloon to a standstill, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Now</i> get up and look, you sapheads.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe done it, and there was the sure-enough water right under us!—clear,\r\nand blue, and cool, and deep, and wavy with the breeze, the loveliest sight\r\nthat ever was. And all about it was grassy banks, and flowers, and shady groves\r\nof big trees, looped together with vines, and all looking so peaceful and\r\ncomfortable—enough to make a body cry, it was so beautiful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim <i>did</i> cry, and rip and dance and carry on, he was so thankful and out\r\nof his mind for joy. It was my watch, so I had to stay by the works, but Tom\r\nand Jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece, and fetched me up a lot, and\r\nI’ve tasted a many a good thing in my life, but nothing that ever begun\r\nwith that water.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we went down and had a swim, and then Tom came up and spelled me, and me\r\nand Jim had a swim, and then Jim spelled Tom, and me and Tom had a foot-race\r\nand a boxing-mill, and I don’t reckon I ever had such a good time in my\r\nlife. It warn’t so very hot, because it was close on to evening, and we\r\nhadn’t any clothes on, anyway. Clothes is well enough in school, and in\r\ntowns, and at balls, too, but there ain’t no sense in them when there\r\nain’t no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussiness around.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Lions a-comin’!—lions! Quick, Mars Tom! Jump for yo’\r\nlife, Huck!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOh, and didn’t we! We never stopped for clothes, but waltzed up the\r\nladder just so. Jim lost his head straight off—he always done it whenever\r\nhe got excited and scared; and so now, ’stead of just easing the ladder\r\nup from the ground a little, so the animals couldn’t reach it, he turned\r\non a raft of power, and we went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before\r\nhe got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing he was doing. Then he\r\nstopped her, but he had clean forgot what to do next; so there we was, so high\r\nthat the lions looked like pups, and we was drifting off on the wind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down, and\r\nback toward the lake, where the animals was gathering like a camp-meeting, and\r\nI judged he had lost <i>his</i> head, too; for he knowed I was too scared to\r\nclimb, and did he want to dump me among the tigers and things?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut no, his head was level, he knowed what he was about. He swooped down to\r\nwithin thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over the center, and\r\nsung out:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Leggo, and drop!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI done it, and shot down, feet first, and seemed to go about a mile toward the\r\nbottom; and when I come up, he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now lay on your back and float till you’re rested and got your\r\npluck back, then I’ll dip the ladder in the water and you can climb\r\naboard.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI done it. Now that was ever so smart in Tom, because if he had started off\r\nsomewheres else to drop down on the sand, the menagerie would ’a’\r\ncome along, too, and might ’a’ kept us hunting a safe place till I\r\ngot tuckered out and fell.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0109%7D.jpg\" width=\"477\" id=\"id-3658332752018479373\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“And all this time the lions and tigers was sorting\r\nout the clothes”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes, and trying\r\nto divide them up so there would be some for all, but there was a\r\nmisunderstanding about it somewheres, on account of some of them trying to hog\r\nmore than their share; so there was another insurrection, and you never see\r\nanything like it in the world. There must ’a’ been fifty of them,\r\nall mixed up together, snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and\r\ntearing, legs and tails in the air, and you couldn’t tell which was\r\nwhich, and the sand and fur a-flying. And when they got done, some was dead and\r\nsome was limping off crippled, and the rest was setting around on the\r\nbattlefield, some of them licking their sore places and the others looking up\r\nat us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and have some fun, but\r\nwhich we didn’t want any.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs for the clothes, they warn’t any, any more. Every last rag of them was\r\ninside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I don’t\r\nreckon, for there was considerable many brass buttons on them, and there was\r\nknives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and nails and chalk and\r\nmarbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn’t caring. All that was\r\nbothering me was, that all we had now was the professor’s clothes, a big\r\nenough assortment, but not suitable to go into company with, if we came across\r\nany, because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the coats and things\r\naccording. Still, there was everything a tailor needed, and Jim was a kind of\r\njack legged tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us\r\nthat would answer.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0009\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER IX.<br>\r\nTOM DISCOURSES ON THE DESERT</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nStill, we thought we would drop down there a minute, but on another errand.\r\nMost of the professor’s cargo of food was put up in cans, in the new way\r\nthat somebody had just invented; the rest was fresh. When you fetch Missouri\r\nbeefsteak to the Great Sahara, you want to be particular and stay up in the\r\ncoolish weather. So we reckoned we would drop down into the lion market and see\r\nhow we could make out there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reach of\r\nthe animals, then we let down a rope with a slip-knot in it and hauled up a\r\ndead lion, a small tender one, then yanked up a cub tiger. We had to keep the\r\ncongregation off with the revolver, or they would ’a’ took a hand\r\nin the proceedings and helped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe carved off a supply from both, and saved the skins, and hove the rest\r\noverboard. Then we baited some of the professor’s hooks with the fresh\r\nmeat and went a-fishing. We stood over the lake just a convenient distance\r\nabove the water, and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see. It was a\r\nmost amazing good supper we had; lion steak, tiger steak, fried fish, and hot\r\ncorn-pone. I don’t want nothing better than that.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0006%7D.jpg\" width=\"436\" id=\"id-1654826590105739197\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“We catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see.”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe had some fruit to finish off with. We got it out of the top of a monstrous\r\ntall tree. It was a very slim tree that hadn’t a branch on it from the\r\nbottom plumb to the top, and there it bursted out like a feather-duster. It was\r\na pa’m-tree, of course; anybody knows a pa’m-tree the minute he see\r\nit, by the pictures. We went for cocoanuts in this one, but there warn’t\r\nnone. There was only big loose bunches of things like oversized grapes, and Tom\r\nallowed they was dates, because he said they answered the description in the\r\nArabian Nights and the other books. Of course they mightn’t be, and they\r\nmight be poison; so we had to wait a spell, and watch and see if the birds et\r\nthem. They done it; so we done it, too, and they was most amazing good.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead animals.\r\nThey was plucky creturs; they would tackle one end of a lion that was being\r\ngnawed at the other end by another lion. If the lion drove the bird away, it\r\ndidn’t do no good; he was back again the minute the lion was busy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe big birds come out of every part of the sky—you could make them out\r\nwith the glass while they was still so far away you couldn’t see them\r\nwith your naked eye. Tom said the birds didn’t find out the meat was\r\nthere by the smell; they had to find it out by seeing it. Oh, but ain’t\r\nthat an eye for you! Tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of dead\r\nlions couldn’t look any bigger than a person’s finger-nail, and he\r\ncouldn’t imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far\r\noff.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion, and we thought maybe they\r\nwarn’t kin. But Jim said that didn’t make no difference. He said a\r\nhog was fond of her own children, and so was a spider, and he reckoned maybe a\r\nlion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite. He thought likely\r\na lion wouldn’t eat his own father, if he knowed which was him, but\r\nreckoned he would eat his brother-in-law if he was uncommon hungry, and eat his\r\nmother-in-law any time. But <i>reckoning</i> don’t settle nothing. You\r\ncan reckon till the cows come home, but that don’t fetch you to no\r\ndecision. So we give it up and let it drop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGenerly it was very still in the Desert nights, but this time there was music.\r\nA lot of other animals come to dinner; sneaking yelpers that Tom allowed was\r\njackals, and roached-backed ones that he said was hyenas; and all the whole\r\nbiling of them kept up a racket all the time. They made a picture in the\r\nmoonlight that was more different than any picture I ever see. We had a line\r\nout and made fast to the top of a tree, and didn’t stand no watch, but\r\nall turned in and slept; but I was up two or three times to look down at the\r\nanimals and hear the music. It was like having a front seat at a menagerie for\r\nnothing, which I hadn’t ever had before, and so it seemed foolish to\r\nsleep and not make the most of it; I mightn’t ever have such a chance\r\nagain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went a-fishing again in the early dawn, and then lazied around all day in\r\nthe deep shade on an island, taking turn about to watch and see that none of\r\nthe animals come a-snooping around there after erronorts for dinner. We was\r\ngoing to leave the next day, but couldn’t, it was too lovely.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe day after, when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward, we\r\nlooked back and watched that place till it warn’t nothing but just a\r\nspeck in the Desert, and I tell you it was like saying good-bye to a friend\r\nthat you ain’t ever going to see any more.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was thinking to himself, and at last he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, we’s mos’ to de end er de Desert now, I\r\nspeck.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, hit stan’ to reason we is. You knows how long we’s\r\nbeen a-skimmin’ over it. Mus’ be mos’ out o’\r\nsan’. Hit’s a wonder to me dat it’s hilt out as long as it\r\nhas.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shucks, there’s plenty sand, you needn’t worry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I ain’t a-worryin’, Mars Tom, only wonderin’,\r\ndat’s all. De Lord’s got plenty san’, I ain’t\r\ndoubtin’ dat; but nemmine, He ain’t gwyne to <i>was’e</i> it\r\njist on dat account; en I allows dat dis Desert’s plenty big enough now,\r\njist de way she is, en you can’t spread her out no mo’ ’dout\r\nwas’in’ san’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, go ’long! we ain’t much more than fairly <i>started</i>\r\nacross this Desert yet. The United States is a pretty big country, ain’t\r\nit? Ain’t it, Huck?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” I says, “there ain’t no bigger one, I\r\ndon’t reckon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” he says, “this Desert is about the shape of the\r\nUnited States, and if you was to lay it down on top of the United States, it\r\nwould cover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket. There’d be\r\na little corner sticking out, up at Maine and away up northwest, and Florida\r\nsticking out like a turtle’s tail, and that’s all. We’ve took\r\nCalifornia away from the Mexicans two or three years ago, so that part of the\r\nPacific coast is ours now, and if you laid the Great Sahara down with her edge\r\non the Pacific, she would cover the United States and stick out past New York\r\nsix hundred miles into the Atlantic ocean.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI say:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good land! have you got the documents for that, Tom Sawyer?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, and they’re right here, and I’ve been studying them.\r\nYou can look for yourself. From New York to the Pacific is 2,600 miles. From\r\none end of the Great Desert to the other is 3,200. The United States contains\r\n3,600,000 square miles, the Desert contains 4,162,000. With the Desert’s\r\nbulk you could cover up every last inch of the United States, and in under\r\nwhere the edges projected out, you could tuck England, Scotland, Ireland,\r\nFrance, Denmark, and all Germany. Yes, sir, you could hide the home of the\r\nbrave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the Great Sahara, and\r\nyou would still have 2,000 square miles of sand left.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” I says, “it clean beats me. Why, Tom, it shows that\r\nthe Lord took as much pains makin’ this Desert as makin’ the United\r\nStates and all them other countries.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim says: “Huck, dat don’ stan’ to reason. I reckon dis\r\nDesert wa’n’t made at all. Now you take en look at it like\r\ndis—you look at it, and see ef I’s right. What’s a desert\r\ngood for? ’Taint good for nuthin’. Dey ain’t no way to make\r\nit pay. Hain’t dat so, Huck?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I reckon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hain’t it so, Mars Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I guess so. Go on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ef a thing ain’t no good, it’s made in vain, ain’t\r\nit?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Now</i>, den! Do de Lord make anything in vain? You answer me\r\ndat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well—no, He don’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Den how come He make a desert?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, go on. How <i>did</i> He come to make it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, I b’lieve it uz jes like when you’s buildin’\r\na house; dey’s allays a lot o’ truck en rubbish lef’ over.\r\nWhat does you do wid it? Doan’ you take en k’yart it off en dump it\r\ninto a ole vacant back lot? ’Course. Now, den, it’s my opinion hit\r\nwas jes like dat—dat de Great Sahara warn’t made at all, she jes\r\n<i>happen</i>’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI said it was a real good argument, and I believed it was the best one Jim ever\r\nmade. Tom he said the same, but said the trouble about arguments is, they\r\nain’t nothing but <i>theories</i>, after all, and theories don’t\r\nprove nothing, they only give you a place to rest on, a spell, when you are\r\ntuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something there\r\nain’t no way <i>to</i> find out. And he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There’s another trouble about theories: there’s always a\r\nhole in them somewheres, sure, if you look close enough. It’s just so\r\nwith this one of Jim’s. Look what billions and billions of stars there\r\nis. How does it come that there was just exactly enough star-stuff, and none\r\nleft over? How does it come there ain’t no sand-pile up there?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Jim was fixed for him and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s de Milky Way?—dat’s what I want to know.\r\nWhat’s de Milky Way? Answer me dat!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn my opinion it was just a sockdologer. It’s only an opinion, it’s\r\nonly <i>my</i> opinion and others may think different; but I said it then and I\r\nstand to it now—it was a sockdologer. And moreover, besides, it landed\r\nTom Sawyer. He couldn’t say a word. He had that stunned look of a person\r\nthat’s been shot in the back with a kag of nails. All he said was, as for\r\npeople like me and Jim, he’d just as soon have intellectual intercourse\r\nwith a catfish. But anybody can say that—and I notice they always do,\r\nwhen somebody has fetched them a lifter. Tom Sawyer was tired of that end of\r\nthe subject.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo we got back to talking about the size of the Desert again, and the more we\r\ncompared it with this and that and t’other thing, the more nobler and\r\nbigger and grander it got to look right along. And so, hunting among the\r\nfiggers, Tom found, by and by, that it was just the same size as the Empire of\r\nChina. Then he showed us the spread the Empire of China made on the map, and\r\nthe room she took up in the world. Well, it was wonderful to think of, and I\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, I’ve heard talk about this Desert plenty of times, but I\r\nnever knowed before how important she was.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Important! Sahara important! That’s just the way with some people.\r\nIf a thing’s big, it’s important. That’s all the sense\r\nthey’ve got. All they can see is <i>size</i>. Why, look at England.\r\nIt’s the most important country in the world; and yet you could put it in\r\nChina’s vest-pocket; and not only that, but you’d have the\r\ndickens’s own time to find it again the next time you wanted it. And look\r\nat Russia. It spreads all around and everywhere, and yet ain’t no more\r\nimportant in this world than Rhode Island is, and hasn’t got half as much\r\nin it that’s worth saving.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAway off now we see a little hill, a-standing up just on the edge of the world.\r\nTom broke off his talk, and reached for a glass very much excited, and took a\r\nlook, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’s it—it’s the one I’ve been looking for,\r\nsure. If I’m right, it’s the one the dervish took the man into and\r\nshowed him all the treasures.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo we begun to gaze, and he begun to tell about it out of the Arabian Nights.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0010\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER X.<br>\r\nTHE TREASURE-HILL</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nTom said it happened like this.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA dervish was stumping it along through the Desert, on foot, one blazing hot\r\nday, and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor, and hungry, and\r\nornery and tired, and along about where we are now he run across a camel-driver\r\nwith a hundred camels, and asked him for some a’ms. But the cameldriver\r\nhe asked to be excused. The dervish said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t you own these camels?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, they’re mine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you in debt?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who—me? No.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, a man that owns a hundred camels and ain’t in debt is\r\nrich—and not only rich, but very rich. Ain’t it so?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe camel-driver owned up that it was so. Then the dervish says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“God has made you rich, and He has made me poor. He has His reasons, and\r\nthey are wise, blessed be His name. But He has willed that His rich shall help\r\nHis poor, and you have turned away from me, your brother, in my need, and He\r\nwill remember this, and you will lose by it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat made the camel-driver feel shaky, but all the same he was born hoggish\r\nafter money and didn’t like to let go a cent; so he begun to whine and\r\nexplain, and said times was hard, and although he had took a full freight down\r\nto Balsora and got a fat rate for it, he couldn’t git no return freight,\r\nand so he warn’t making no great things out of his trip. So the dervish\r\nstarts along again, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, if you want to take the risk; but I reckon you’ve made\r\na mistake this time, and missed a chance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course the camel-driver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had missed,\r\nbecause maybe there was money in it; so he run after the dervish, and begged\r\nhim so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the dervish gave in,\r\nand says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you see that hill yonder? Well, in that hill is all the treasures of\r\nthe earth, and I was looking around for a man with a particular good kind heart\r\nand a noble, generous disposition, because if I could find just that man,\r\nI’ve got a kind of a salve I could put on his eyes and he could see the\r\ntreasures and get them out.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0121%7D.jpg\" width=\"388\" id=\"id-6574305119827512171\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“The camel-driver in the treasure-cave”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then the camel-driver was in a sweat; and he cried, and begged, and took on,\r\nand went down on his knees, and said he was just that kind of a man, and said\r\nhe could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasn’t ever described\r\nso exact before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then,” says the dervish, “all right. If we load the\r\nhundred camels, can I have half of them?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe driver was so glad he couldn’t hardly hold in, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now you’re shouting.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo they shook hands on the bargain, and the dervish got out his box and rubbed\r\nthe salve on the driver’s right eye, and the hill opened and he went in,\r\nand there, sure enough, was piles and piles of gold and jewels sparkling like\r\nall the stars in heaven had fell down.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo him and the dervish laid into it, and they loaded every camel till he\r\ncouldn’t carry no more; then they said good-bye, and each of them started\r\noff with his fifty. But pretty soon the camel-driver come a-running and\r\novertook the dervish and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You ain’t in society, you know, and you don’t really need\r\nall you’ve got. Won’t you be good, and let me have ten of your\r\ncamels?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well,” the dervish says, “I don’t know but what you\r\nsay is reasonable enough.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo he done it, and they separated and the dervish started off again with his\r\nforty. But pretty soon here comes the camel-driver bawling after him again, and\r\nwhines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him, saying thirty camel\r\nloads of treasures was enough to see a dervish through, because they live very\r\nsimple, you know, and don’t keep house, but board around and give their\r\nnote.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut that warn’t the end yet. That ornery hound kept coming and coming\r\ntill he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred. Then he was\r\nsatisfied, and ever so grateful, and said he wouldn’t ever forgit the\r\ndervish as long as he lived, and nobody hadn’t been so good to him\r\nbefore, and liberal. So they shook hands good-bye, and separated and started\r\noff again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut do you know, it warn’t ten minutes till the camel-driver was\r\nunsatisfied again—he was the lowdownest reptyle in seven\r\ncounties—and he come a-running again. And this time the thing he wanted\r\nwas to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?” said the dervish.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, you know,” says the driver.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Know what?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, you can’t fool me,” says the driver.\r\n“You’re trying to keep back something from me, you know it mighty\r\nwell. You know, I reckon, that if I had the salve on the other eye I could see\r\na lot more things that’s valuable. Come—please put it on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe dervish says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wasn’t keeping anything back from you. I don’t mind\r\ntelling you what would happen if I put it on. You’d never see again.\r\nYou’d be stone-blind the rest of your days.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut do you know that beat wouldn’t believe him. No, he begged and begged,\r\nand whined and cried, till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to\r\nput it on, if he wanted to. So the man done it, and sure enough he was as blind\r\nas a bat in a minute.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him; and\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good-bye—a man that’s blind hain’t got no use for\r\njewelry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd he cleared out with the hundred camels, and left that man to wander around\r\npoor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the Desert.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim said he’d bet it was a lesson to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” Tom says, “and like a considerable many lessons a body\r\ngets. They ain’t no account, because the thing don’t ever happen\r\nthe same way again—and can’t. The time Hen Scovil fell down the\r\nchimbly and crippled his back for life, everybody said it would be a lesson to\r\nhim. What kind of a lesson? How was he going to use it? He couldn’t climb\r\nchimblies no more, and he hadn’t no more backs to break.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All de same, Mars Tom, dey <i>is</i> sich a thing as learnin’ by\r\nexpe’ence. De Good Book say de burnt chile shun de fire.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I ain’t denying that a thing’s a lesson if it’s\r\na thing that can happen twice just the same way. There’s lots of such\r\nthings, and <i>they</i> educate a person, that’s what Uncle Abner always\r\nsaid; but there’s forty <i>million</i> lots of the other kind—the\r\nkind that don’t happen the same way twice—and they ain’t no\r\nreal use, they ain’t no more instructive than the small-pox. When\r\nyou’ve got it, it ain’t no good to find out you ought to been\r\nvaccinated, and it ain’t no good to git vaccinated afterward, because the\r\nsmall-pox don’t come but once. But, on the other hand, Uncle Abner said\r\nthat the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or\r\nseventy times as much as a person that hadn’t, and said a person that\r\nstarted in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was\r\nalways going to be useful to him, and warn’t ever going to grow dim or\r\ndoubtful. But I can tell you, Jim, Uncle Abner was down on them people\r\nthat’s all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that\r\nhappens, no matter whether—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Jim was asleep. Tom looked kind of ashamed, because you know a person\r\nalways feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person\r\nis admiring, and that other person goes to sleep that way. Of course he\r\noughtn’t to go to sleep, because it’s shabby; but the finer a\r\nperson talks the certainer it is to make you sleep, and so when you come to\r\nlook at it it ain’t nobody’s fault in particular; both of\r\nthem’s to blame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim begun to snore—soft and blubbery at first, then a long rasp, then a\r\nstronger one, then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking\r\ndown the plug-hole of a bath-tub, then the same with more power to it, and some\r\nbig coughs and snorts flung in, the way a cow does that is choking to death;\r\nand when the person has got to that point he is at his level best, and can wake\r\nup a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him, but\r\ncan’t wake himself up although all that awful noise of his’n\r\nain’t but three inches from his own ears. And that is the curiosest thing\r\nin the world, seems to me. But you rake a match to light the candle, and that\r\nlittle bit of a noise will fetch him. I wish I knowed what was the reason of\r\nthat, but there don’t seem to be no way to find out. Now there was Jim\r\nalarming the whole Desert, and yanking the animals out, for miles and miles\r\naround, to see what in the nation was going on up there; there warn’t\r\nnobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as <i>he</i> was, and yet he\r\nwas the only cretur that wasn’t disturbed by it. We yelled at him and\r\nwhooped at him, it never done no good; but the first time there come a little\r\nwee noise that wasn’t of a usual kind it woke him up. No, sir, I’ve\r\nthought it all over, and so has Tom, and there ain’t no way to find out\r\nwhy a snorer can’t hear himself snore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim said he hadn’t been asleep; he just shut his eyes so he could listen\r\nbetter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom said nobody warn’t accusing him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat made him look like he wished he hadn’t said anything. And he wanted\r\nto git away from the subject, I reckon, because he begun to abuse the\r\ncamel-driver, just the way a person does when he has got catched in something\r\nand wants to take it out of somebody else. He let into the camel-driver the\r\nhardest he knowed how, and I had to agree with him; and he praised up the\r\ndervish the highest he could, and I had to agree with him there, too. But Tom\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I ain’t so sure. You call that dervish so dreadful liberal and\r\ngood and unselfish, but I don’t quite see it. He didn’t hunt up\r\nanother poor dervish, did he? No, he didn’t. If he was so unselfish, why\r\ndidn’t he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along\r\nand be satisfied? No, sir, the person he was hunting for was a man with a\r\nhundred camels. He wanted to get away with all the treasure he could.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Mars Tom, he was willin’ to divide, fair and square; he only\r\nstruck for fifty camels.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, he <i>tole</i> de man de truck would make him bline.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, because he knowed the man’s character. It was just the kind\r\nof a man he was hunting for—a man that never believes in anybody’s\r\nword or anybody’s honorableness, because he ain’t got none of his\r\nown. I reckon there’s lots of people like that dervish. They swindle,\r\nright and left, but they always make the other person SEEM to swindle himself.\r\nThey keep inside of the letter of the law all the time, and there ain’t\r\nno way to git hold of them. <i>They</i> don’t put the salve on—oh,\r\nno, that would be sin; but they know how to fool <i>you</i> into putting it on,\r\nthen it’s you that blinds yourself. I reckon the dervish and the\r\ncamel-driver was just a pair—a fine, smart, brainy rascal, and a dull,\r\ncoarse, ignorant one, but both of them rascals, just the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, does you reckon dey’s any o’ dat kind o’\r\nsalve in de worl’ now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Uncle Abner says there is. He says they’ve got it in New\r\nYork, and they put it on country people’s eyes and show them all the\r\nrailroads in the world, and they go in and git them, and then when they rub the\r\nsalve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their\r\nrailroads. Here’s the treasure-hill now. Lower away!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe landed, but it warn’t as interesting as I thought it was going to be,\r\nbecause we couldn’t find the place where they went in to git the\r\ntreasure. Still, it was plenty interesting enough, just to see the mere hill\r\nitself where such a wonderful thing happened. Jim said he wou’dn’t\r\n’a’ missed it for three dollars, and I felt the same way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd to me and Jim, as wonderful a thing as any was the way Tom could come into\r\na strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like\r\nthat and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just\r\nlike it, and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural\r\nsmartness. We talked and talked it over together, but couldn’t make out\r\nhow he done it. He had the best head on him I ever see; and all he lacked was\r\nage, to make a name for himself equal to Captain Kidd or George Washington. I\r\nbet you it would ’a’ crowded either of <i>them</i> to find that\r\nhill, with all their gifts, but it warn’t nothing to Tom Sawyer; he went\r\nacross Sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out\r\nof a bunch of angels.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the\r\nedges, and loaded up the lion’s skin and the tiger’s so as they\r\nwould keep till Jim could tan them.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0011\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER XI.<br>\r\nTHE SAND-STORM</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWe went a-fooling along for a day or two, and then just as the full moon was\r\ntouching the ground on the other side of the desert, we see a string of little\r\nblack figgers moving across its big silver face. You could see them as plain as\r\nif they was painted on the moon with ink. It was another caravan. We cooled\r\ndown our speed and tagged along after it, just to have company, though it\r\nwarn’t going our way. It was a rattler, that caravan, and a most bully\r\nsight to look at next morning when the sun come a-streaming across the desert\r\nand flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand\r\ngrand-daddy-long-legses marching in procession. We never went very near it,\r\nbecause we knowed better now than to act like that and scare people’s\r\ncamels and break up their caravans. It was the gayest outfit you ever see, for\r\nrich clothes and nobby style. Some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries, the first\r\nwe ever see, and very tall, and they go plunging along like they was on stilts,\r\nand they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner\r\nconsiderable, I bet you, but they make noble good time, and a camel ain’t\r\nnowheres with them for speed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe caravan camped, during the middle part of the day, and then started again\r\nabout the middle of the afternoon. Before long the sun begun to look very\r\ncurious. First it kind of turned to brass, and then to copper, and after that\r\nit begun to look like a blood-red ball, and the air got hot and close, and\r\npretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy, but\r\nfiery and dreadful—like it looks through a piece of red glass, you know.\r\nWe looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan, and a rushing\r\nevery which way like they was scared; and then they all flopped down flat in\r\nthe sand and laid there perfectly still.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall,\r\nand reached from the Desert up into the sky and hid the sun, and it was coming\r\nlike the nation, too. Then a little faint breeze struck us, and then it come\r\nharder, and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire,\r\nand Tom sung out:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s a sand-storm—turn your backs to it!”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0131%7D.jpg\" width=\"458\" id=\"id-953964077162208989\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“In the sand-storm”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe done it; and in another minute it was blowing a gale, and the sand beat\r\nagainst us by the shovelful, and the air was so thick with it we couldn’t\r\nsee a thing. In five minutes the boat was level full, and we was setting on the\r\nlockers buried up to the chin in sand, and only our heads out and could hardly\r\nbreathe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen the storm thinned, and we see that monstrous wall go a-sailing off across\r\nthe desert, awful to look at, I tell you. We dug ourselves out and looked down,\r\nand where the caravan was before there wasn’t anything but just the sand\r\nocean now, and all still and quiet. All them people and camels was smothered\r\nand dead and buried—buried under ten foot of sand, we reckoned, and Tom\r\nallowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them, and all that time\r\ntheir friends wouldn’t ever know what become of that caravan. Tom said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Now</i> we know what it was that happened to the people we got the\r\nswords and pistols from.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, sir, that was just it. It was as plain as day now. They got buried in a\r\nsand-storm, and the wild animals couldn’t get at them, and the wind never\r\nuncovered them again until they was dried to leather and warn’t fit to\r\neat. It seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as a person\r\ncould for anybody, and as mournful, too, but we was mistaken; this last\r\ncaravan’s death went harder with us, a good deal harder. You see, the\r\nothers was total strangers, and we never got to feeling acquainted with them at\r\nall, except, maybe, a little with the man that was watching the girl, but it\r\nwas different with this last caravan. We was huvvering around them a whole\r\nnight and ’most a whole day, and had got to feeling real friendly with\r\nthem, and acquainted. I have found out that there ain’t no surer way to\r\nfind out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them. Just so\r\nwith these. We kind of liked them from the start, and traveling with them put\r\non the finisher. The longer we traveled with them, and the more we got used to\r\ntheir ways, the better and better we liked them, and the gladder and gladder we\r\nwas that we run across them. We had come to know some of them so well that we\r\ncalled them by name when we was talking about them, and soon got so familiar\r\nand sociable that we even dropped the Miss and Mister and just used their plain\r\nnames without any handle, and it did not seem unpolite, but just the right\r\nthing. Of course, it wasn’t their own names, but names we give them.\r\nThere was Mr. Elexander Robinson and Miss Adaline Robinson, and Colonel Jacob\r\nMcDougal and Miss Harryet McDougal, and Judge Jeremiah Butler and young Bushrod\r\nButler, and these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and\r\nsimmeters, and dressed like the Grand Mogul, and their families. But as soon as\r\nwe come to know them good, and like them very much, it warn’t Mister, nor\r\nJudge, nor nothing, any more, but only Elleck, and Addy, and Jake, and Hattie,\r\nand Jerry, and Buck, and so on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their sorrows,\r\nthe more nearer and dearer they come to be to you. Now we warn’t cold and\r\nindifferent, the way most travelers is, we was right down friendly and\r\nsociable, and took a chance in everything that was going, and the caravan could\r\ndepend on us to be on hand every time, it didn’t make no difference what\r\nit was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they camped, we camped right over them, ten or twelve hundred feet up in\r\nthe air. When they et a meal, we et ourn, and it made it ever so much\r\nhome-liker to have their company. When they had a wedding that night, and Buck\r\nand Addy got married, we got ourselves up in the very starchiest of the\r\nprofessor’s duds for the blow-out, and when they danced we jined in and\r\nshook a foot up there.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0135%7D.jpg\" width=\"431\" id=\"id-7959734054500962255\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“When they danced we joined in and shook a foot up\r\nthere”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest, and it was a funeral\r\nthat done it with us. It was next morning, just in the still dawn. We\r\ndidn’t know the diseased, and he warn’t in our set, but that never\r\nmade no difference; he belonged to the caravan, and that was enough, and there\r\nwarn’t no more sincerer tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on\r\nhim from up there eleven hundred foot on high.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to part with\r\nthem others, which was comparative strangers, and been dead so long, anyway. We\r\nhad knowed these in their lives, and was fond of them, too, and now to have\r\ndeath snatch them from right before our faces while we was looking, and leave\r\nus so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big desert, it did hurt so,\r\nand we wished we mightn’t ever make any more friends on that voyage if we\r\nwas going to lose them again like that.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"494\" src=\"images/%7B0139%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-1342045412553395175\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“The wedding procession”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe couldn’t keep from talking about them, and they was all the time\r\ncoming up in our memory, and looking just the way they looked when we was all\r\nalive and happy together. We could see the line marching, and the shiny\r\nspearheads a-winking in the sun; we could see the dromedaries lumbering along;\r\nwe could see the wedding and the funeral; and more oftener than anything else\r\nwe could see them praying, because they don’t allow nothing to prevent\r\nthat; whenever the call come, several times a day, they would stop right there,\r\nand stand up and face to the east, and lift back their heads, and spread out\r\ntheir arms and begin, and four or five times they would go down on their knees,\r\nand then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, it warn’t good to go on talking about them, lovely as they was in\r\ntheir life, and dear to us in their life and death both, because it\r\ndidn’t do no good, and made us too down-hearted. Jim allowed he was going\r\nto live as good a life as he could, so he could see them again in a better\r\nworld; and Tom kept still and didn’t tell him they was only Mohammedans;\r\nit warn’t no use to disappoint him, he was feeling bad enough just as it\r\nwas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller, and had had a\r\nmost powerful good sleep, because sand is the comfortablest bed there is, and I\r\ndon’t see why people that can afford it don’t have it more. And\r\nit’s terrible good ballast, too; I never see the balloon so steady\r\nbefore.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom allowed we had twenty tons of it, and wondered what we better do with it;\r\nit was good sand, and it didn’t seem good sense to throw it away. Jim\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, can’t we tote it back home en sell it? How long’ll\r\nit take?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Depends on the way we go.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, sah, she’s wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home, en I\r\nreckon we’s got as much as twenty loads, hain’t we? How much would\r\ndat be?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Five dollars.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“By jings, Mars Tom, le’s shove for home right on de spot!\r\nHit’s more’n a dollar en a half apiece, hain’t it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, ef dat ain’t makin’ money de easiest ever <i>I</i>\r\nstruck! She jes’ rained in—never cos’ us a lick o’\r\nwork. Le’s mosey right along, Mars Tom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never heard him.\r\nPretty soon he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Five dollars—sho! Look here, this sand’s\r\nworth—worth—why, it’s worth no end of money.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How is dat, Mars Tom? Go on, honey, go on!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, the minute people knows it’s genuwyne sand from the genuwyne\r\nDesert of Sahara, they’ll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold\r\nof some of it to keep on the what-not in a vial with a label on it for a\r\ncuriosity. All we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around all over\r\nthe United States and peddle them out at ten cents apiece. We’ve got all\r\nof ten thousand dollars’ worth of sand in this boat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMe and Jim went all to pieces with joy, and begun to shout whoopjamboreehoo,\r\nand Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And we can keep on coming back and fetching sand, and coming back and\r\nfetching more sand, and just keep it a-going till we’ve carted this whole\r\nDesert over there and sold it out; and there ain’t ever going to be any\r\nopposition, either, because we’ll take out a patent.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My goodness,” I says, “we’ll be as rich as Creosote,\r\nwon’t we, Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes—Creesus, you mean. Why, that dervish was hunting in that\r\nlittle hill for the treasures of the earth, and didn’t know he was\r\nwalking over the real ones for a thousand miles. He was blinder than he made\r\nthe driver.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, how much is we gwyne to be worth?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I don’t know yet. It’s got to be ciphered, and it\r\nain’t the easiest job to do, either, because it’s over four million\r\nsquare miles of sand at ten cents a vial.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was awful excited, but this faded it out considerable, and he shook his\r\nhead and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, we can’t ’ford all dem vials—a king\r\ncouldn’t. We better not try to take de whole Desert, Mars Tom, de vials\r\ngwyne to bust us, sho’.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom’s excitement died out, too, now, and I reckoned it was on account of\r\nthe vials, but it wasn’t. He set there thinking, and got bluer and bluer,\r\nand at last he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Boys, it won’t work; we got to give it up.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“On account of the duties.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI couldn’t make nothing out of that, neither could Jim. I says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What <i>is</i> our duty, Tom? Because if we can’t git around it,\r\nwhy can’t we just <i>do</i> it? People often has to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, it ain’t that kind of duty. The kind I mean is a tax. Whenever\r\nyou strike a frontier—that’s the border of a country, you\r\nknow—you find a custom-house there, and the gov’ment officers comes\r\nand rummages among your things and charges a big tax, which they call a duty\r\nbecause it’s their duty to bust you if they can, and if you don’t\r\npay the duty they’ll hog your sand. They call it confiscating, but that\r\ndon’t deceive nobody, it’s just hogging, and that’s all it\r\nis. Now if we try to carry this sand home the way we’re pointed now, we\r\ngot to climb fences till we git tired—just frontier after\r\nfrontier—Egypt, Arabia, Hindostan, and so on, and they’ll all whack\r\non a duty, and so you see, easy enough, we <i>can’t</i> go <i>that</i>\r\nroad.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Tom,” I says, “we can sail right over their old\r\nfrontiers; how are <i>they</i> going to stop us?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked sorrowful at me, and says, very grave:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Huck Finn, do you think that would be honest?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI hate them kind of interruptions. I never said nothing, and he went on:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, we’re shut off the other way, too. If we go back the way\r\nwe’ve come, there’s the New York custom-house, and that is worse\r\nthan all of them others put together, on account of the kind of cargo\r\nwe’ve got.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, they can’t raise Sahara sand in America, of course, and when\r\nthey can’t raise a thing there, the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per\r\ncent. on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There ain’t no sense in that, Tom Sawyer.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who said there <i>was?</i> What do you talk to me like that for, Huck\r\nFinn? You wait till I say a thing’s got sense in it before you go to\r\naccusing me of saying it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, consider me crying about it, and sorry. Go on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, do dey jam dat duty onto everything we can’t raise in\r\nAmerica, en don’t make no ’stinction ’twix’\r\nanything?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, that’s what they do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, ain’t de blessin’ o’ de Lord de mos’\r\nvaluable thing dey is?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, it is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t de preacher stan’ up in de pulpit en call it down on\r\nde people?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Whah do it come from?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“From heaven.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yassir! you’s jes’ right, ’deed you is, honey—it\r\ncome from heaven, en dat’s a foreign country. <i>Now</i>, den! do dey put\r\na tax on dat blessin’?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, they don’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Course dey don’t; en so it stan’ to reason dat you’s\r\nmistaken, Mars Tom. Dey wouldn’t put de tax on po’ truck like\r\nsan’, dat everybody ain’t ’bleeged to have, en leave it\r\noff’n de bes’ thing dey is, which nobody can’t git along\r\nwidout.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom Sawyer was stumped; he see Jim had got him where he couldn’t budge.\r\nHe tried to wiggle out by saying they had <i>forgot</i> to put on that tax, but\r\nthey’d be sure to remember about it, next session of Congress, and then\r\nthey’d put it on, but that was a poor lame come-off, and he knowed it. He\r\nsaid there warn’t nothing foreign that warn’t taxed but just that\r\none, and so they couldn’t be consistent without taxing it, and to be\r\nconsistent was the first law of politics. So he stuck to it that they’d\r\nleft it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it\r\nbefore they got caught and laughed at.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut I didn’t feel no more interest in such things, as long as we\r\ncouldn’t git our sand through, and it made me low-spirited, and Jim the\r\nsame. Tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another\r\nspeculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better, but it\r\ndidn’t do no good, we didn’t believe there was any as big as this.\r\nIt was mighty hard; such a little while ago we was so rich, and could\r\n’a’ bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and\r\nhappy, and now we was so poor and ornery again, and had our sand left on our\r\nhands. The sand was looking so lovely before, just like gold and\r\ndi’monds, and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice, but now I\r\ncouldn’t bear the sight of it, it made me sick to look at it, and I\r\nknowed I wouldn’t ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it, and\r\nI didn’t have it there no more to remind us of what we had been and what\r\nwe had got degraded down to. The others was feeling the same way about it that\r\nI was. I knowed it, because they cheered up so, the minute I says le’s\r\nthrow this truck overboard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWell, it was going to be work, you know, and pretty solid work, too; so Tom he\r\ndivided it up according to fairness and strength. He said me and him would\r\nclear out a fifth apiece of the sand, and Jim three-fifths. Jim he didn’t\r\nquite like that arrangement. He says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Course I’s de stronges’, en I’s willin’ to do a\r\nshare accordin’, but by jings you’s kinder pilin’ it onto ole\r\nJim, Mars Tom, hain’t you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I didn’t think so, Jim, but you try your hand at fixing it,\r\nand let’s see.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo Jim reckoned it wouldn’t be no more than fair if me and Tom done a\r\n<i>tenth</i> apiece. Tom he turned his back to git room and be private, and\r\nthen he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole Sahara to the\r\nwestward, back to the Atlantic edge of it where we come from. Then he turned\r\naround again and said it was a good enough arrangement, and we was satisfied if\r\nJim was. Jim said he was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then Tom measured off our two-tenths in the bow and left the rest for Jim,\r\nand it surprised Jim a good deal to see how much difference there was and what\r\na raging lot of sand his share come to, and said he was powerful glad now that\r\nhe had spoke up in time and got the first arrangement altered, for he said that\r\neven the way it was now, there was more sand than enjoyment in his end of the\r\ncontract, he believed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we laid into it. It was mighty hot work, and tough; so hot we had to move\r\nup into cooler weather or we couldn’t ’a’ stood it. Me and\r\nTom took turn about, and one worked while t’other rested, but there\r\nwarn’t nobody to spell poor old Jim, and he made all that part of Africa\r\ndamp, he sweated so. We couldn’t work good, we was so full of laugh, and\r\nJim he kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so, and we had to keep\r\nmaking up things to account for it, and they was pretty poor inventions, but\r\nthey done well enough, Jim didn’t see through them. At last when we got\r\ndone we was ’most dead, but not with work but with laughing. By and by\r\nJim was ’most dead, too, but: it was with work; then we took turns and\r\nspelled him, and he was as thankfull as he could be, and would set on the\r\ngunnel and swab the sweat, and heave and pant, and say how good we was to a\r\npoor old nigger, and he wouldn’t ever forgit us. He was always the\r\ngratefulest nigger I ever see, for any little thing you done for him. He was\r\nonly nigger outside; inside he was as white as you be.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0012\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER XII.<br>\r\nJIM STANDING SIEGE</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next few meals was pretty sandy, but that don’t make no difference\r\nwhen you are hungry; and when you ain’t it ain’t no satisfaction to\r\neat, anyway, and so a little grit in the meat ain’t no particular\r\ndrawback, as far as I can see.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we struck the east end of the Desert at last, sailing on a northeast\r\ncourse. Away off on the edge of the sand, in a soft pinky light, we see three\r\nlittle sharp roofs like tents, and Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s the pyramids of Egypt.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt made my heart fairly jump. You see, I had seen a many and a many a picture\r\nof them, and heard tell about them a hundred times, and yet to come on them all\r\nof a sudden, that way, and find they was <i>real</i>, ’stead of\r\nimaginations, ’most knocked the breath out of me with surprise.\r\nIt’s a curious thing, that the more you hear about a grand and big and\r\nbully thing or person, the more it kind of dreamies out, as you may say, and\r\ngets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothing solid to\r\nit. It’s just so with George Washington, and the same with them pyramids.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd moreover, besides, the thing they always said about them seemed to me to be\r\nstretchers. There was a feller come to the Sunday-school once, and had a\r\npicture of them, and made a speech, and said the biggest pyramid covered\r\nthirteen acres, and was most five hundred foot high, just a steep mountain, all\r\nbuilt out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau, and laid up in perfectly\r\nregular layers, like stair-steps. Thirteen acres, you see, for just one\r\nbuilding; it’s a farm. If it hadn’t been in Sunday-school, I would\r\n’a’ judged it was a lie; and outside I was certain of it. And he\r\nsaid there was a hole in the pyramid, and you could go in there with candles,\r\nand go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel, and come to a large room in the\r\nstomach of that stone mountain, and there you would find a big stone chest with\r\na king in it, four thousand years old. I said to myself, then, if that\r\nain’t a lie I will eat that king if they will fetch him, for even\r\nMethusalem warn’t that old, and nobody claims it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a long\r\nstraight edge like a blanket, and on to it was joined, edge to edge, a wide\r\ncountry of bright green, with a snaky stripe crooking through it, and Tom said\r\nit was the Nile. It made my heart jump again, for the Nile was another thing\r\nthat wasn’t real to me. Now I can tell you one thing which is dead\r\ncertain: if you will fool along over three thousand miles of yaller sand, all\r\nglimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes water to look at it, and\r\nyou’ve been a considerable part of a week doing it, the green country\r\nwill look so like home and heaven to you that it will make your eyes water\r\n<i>again</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was just so with me, and the same with Jim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd when Jim got so he could believe it <i>was</i> the land of Egypt he was\r\nlooking at, he wouldn’t enter it standing up, but got down on his knees\r\nand took off his hat, because he said it wasn’t fitten’ for a\r\nhumble poor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as Moses and\r\nJoseph and Pharaoh and the other prophets. He was a Presbyterian, and had a\r\nmost deep respect for Moses which was a Presbyterian, too, he said. He was all\r\nstirred up, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hit’s de lan’ of Egypt, de lan’ of Egypt, en I’s\r\n’lowed to look at it wid my own eyes! En dah’s de river dat was\r\nturn’ to blood, en I’s looking at de very same groun’ whah de\r\nplagues was, en de lice, en de frogs, en de locus’, en de hail, en whah\r\ndey marked de door-pos’, en de angel o’ de Lord come by in de\r\ndarkness o’ de night en slew de fust-born in all de lan’ o’\r\nEgypt. Ole Jim ain’t worthy to see dis day!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd then he just broke down and cried, he was so thankful. So between him and\r\nTom there was talk enough, Jim being excited because the land was so full of\r\nhistory—Joseph and his brethren, Moses in the bulrushers, Jacob coming\r\ndown into Egypt to buy corn, the silver cup in the sack, and all them\r\ninteresting things; and Tom just as excited too, because the land was so full\r\nof history that was in <i>his</i> line, about Noureddin, and Bedreddin, and\r\nsuch like monstrous giants, that made Jim’s wool rise, and a raft of\r\nother Arabian Nights folks, which the half of them never done the things they\r\nlet on they done, I don’t believe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we struck a disappointment, for one of them early morning fogs started up,\r\nand it warn’t no use to sail over the top of it, because we would go by\r\nEgypt, sure, so we judged it was best to set her by compass straight for the\r\nplace where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted out, and then drop low\r\nand skin along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp lookout. Tom took\r\nthe hellum, I stood by to let go the anchor, and Jim he straddled the bow to\r\ndig through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger ahead. We went along\r\na steady gait, but not very fast, and the fog got solider and solider, so solid\r\nthat Jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it. It was awful still, and we\r\ntalked low and was anxious. Now and then Jim would say:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Highst her a p’int, Mars Tom, highst her!” and up she would\r\nskip, a foot or two, and we would slide right over a flat-roofed mud cabin,\r\nwith people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap and\r\nstretch; and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he could gap\r\nand stretch better, we took him a blip in the back and knocked him off. By and\r\nby, after about an hour, and everything dead still and we a-straining our ears\r\nfor sounds and holding our breath, the fog thinned a little, very sudden, and\r\nJim sung out in an awful scare:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, for de lan’s sake, set her back, Mars Tom, here’s de\r\nbiggest giant outen de ’Rabian Nights a-comin’ for us!” and\r\nhe went over backwards in the boat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom slammed on the back-action, and as we slowed to a standstill a man’s\r\nface as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel, same as a house\r\nlooks out of its windows, and I laid down and died. I must ’a’ been\r\nclear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more; then I come to, and Tom\r\nhad hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding the\r\nballoon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and got a good long look\r\nup at that awful face.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim was on his knees with his hands clasped, gazing up at the thing in a\r\nbegging way, and working his lips, but not getting anything out. I took only\r\njust a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He ain’t alive, you fools; it’s the Sphinx!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI never see Tom look so little and like a fly; but that was because the\r\ngiant’s head was so big and awful. Awful, yes, so it was, but not\r\ndreadful any more, because you could see it was a noble face, and kind of sad,\r\nand not thinking about you, but about other things and larger. It was stone,\r\nreddish stone, and its nose and ears battered, and that give it an abused look,\r\nand you felt sorrier for it for that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe stood off a piece, and sailed around it and over it, and it was just grand.\r\nIt was a man’s head, or maybe a woman’s, on a tiger’s body a\r\nhundred and twenty-five foot long, and there was a dear little temple between\r\nits front paws. All but the head used to be under the sand, for hundreds of\r\nyears, maybe thousands, but they had just lately dug the sand away and found\r\nthat little temple. It took a power of sand to bury that cretur; most as much\r\nas it would to bury a steamboat, I reckon.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"600\" src=\"images/%7B0151%7D.jpg\" width=\"331\" id=\"id-5633093673872702574\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“Jim standing a siege”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe landed Jim on top of the head, with an American flag to protect him, it\r\nbeing a foreign land; then we sailed off to this and that and t’other\r\ndistance, to git what Tom called effects and perspectives and proportions, and\r\nJim he done the best he could, striking all the different kinds of attitudes\r\nand positions he could study up, but standing on his head and working his legs\r\nthe way a frog does was the best. The further we got away, the littler Jim got,\r\nand the grander the Sphinx got, till at last it was only a clothespin on a\r\ndome, as you might say. That’s the way perspective brings out the correct\r\nproportions, Tom said; he said Julus Cesar’s niggers didn’t know\r\nhow big he was, they was too close to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we sailed off further and further, till we couldn’t see Jim at all\r\nany more, and then that great figger was at its noblest, a-gazing out over the\r\nNile Valley so still and solemn and lonesome, and all the little shabby huts\r\nand things that was scattered about it clean disappeared and gone, and nothing\r\naround it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet, which was the sand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat was the right place to stop, and we done it. We set there a-looking and\r\na-thinking for a half an hour, nobody a-saying anything, for it made us feel\r\nquiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over that valley just\r\nthat same way, and thinking its awful thoughts all to itself for thousands of\r\nyears, and nobody can’t find out what they are to this day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last I took up the glass and see some little black things a-capering around\r\non that velvet carpet, and some more a-climbing up the cretur’s back, and\r\nthen I see two or three wee puffs of white smoke, and told Tom to look. He done\r\nit, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They’re bugs. No—hold on; they—why, I believe\r\nthey’re men. Yes, it’s men—men and horses both. They’re\r\nhauling a long ladder up onto the Sphinx’s back—now ain’t\r\nthat odd? And now they’re trying to lean it up a—there’s some\r\nmore puffs of smoke—it’s guns! Huck, they’re after\r\nJim.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"423\" src=\"images/%7B0155%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-7215844607943649204\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“Rescue of Jim”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\nWe clapped on the power, and went for them a-biling. We was there in no time,\r\nand come a-whizzing down amongst them, and they broke and scattered every which\r\nway, and some that was climbing the ladder after Jim let go all holts and fell.\r\nWe soared up and found him laying on top of the head panting and most tuckered\r\nout, partly from howling for help and partly from scare. He had been standing a\r\nsiege a long time—a week, <i>he</i> said, but it warn’t so, it only\r\njust seemed so to him because they was crowding him so. They had shot at him,\r\nand rained the bullets all around him, but he warn’t hit, and when they\r\nfound he wouldn’t stand up and the bullets couldn’t git at him when\r\nhe was laying down, they went for the ladder, and then he knowed it was all up\r\nwith him if we didn’t come pretty quick. Tom was very indignant, and\r\nasked him why he didn’t show the flag and command them to <i>git</i>, in\r\nthe name of the United States. Jim said he done it, but they never paid no\r\nattention. Tom said he would have this thing looked into at Washington, and\r\nsays:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You’ll see that they’ll have to apologize for insulting the\r\nflag, and pay an indemnity, too, on top of it even if they git off <i>that</i>\r\neasy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s an indemnity, Mars Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s cash, that’s what it is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who gits it, Mars Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, <i>we</i> do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“En who gits de apology?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The United States. Or, we can take whichever we please. We can take the\r\napology, if we want to, and let the gov’ment take the money.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How much money will it be, Mars Tom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, in an aggravated case like this one, it will be at least three\r\ndollars apiece, and I don’t know but more.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, den, we’ll take de money, Mars Tom, blame de ’pology.\r\nHain’t dat yo’ notion, too? En hain’t it yourn, Huck?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as any, so\r\nwe agreed to take the money. It was a new business to me, and I asked Tom if\r\ncountries always apologized when they had done wrong, and he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; the little ones does.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe was sailing around examining the pyramids, you know, and now we soared up\r\nand roosted on the flat top of the biggest one, and found it was just like what\r\nthe man said in the Sunday-school. It was like four pairs of stairs that starts\r\nbroad at the bottom and slants up and comes together in a point at the top,\r\nonly these stair-steps couldn’t be clumb the way you climb other stairs;\r\nno, for each step was as high as your chin, and you have to be boosted up from\r\nbehind. The two other pyramids warn’t far away, and the people moving\r\nabout on the sand between looked like bugs crawling, we was so high above them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom he couldn’t hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and\r\nastonishment to be in such a celebrated place, and he just dripped history from\r\nevery pore, seemed to me. He said he couldn’t scarcely believe he was\r\nstanding on the very identical spot the prince flew from on the Bronze Horse.\r\nIt was in the Arabian Night times, he said. Somebody give the prince a bronze\r\nhorse with a peg in its shoulder, and he could git on him and fly through the\r\nair like a bird, and go all over the world, and steer it by turning the peg,\r\nand fly high or low and land wherever he wanted to.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences that\r\ncomes, you know, when a person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry\r\nfor him and wish you could think of some way to change the subject and let him\r\ndown easy, but git stuck and don’t see no way, and before you can pull\r\nyour mind together and <i>do</i> something, that silence has got in and spread\r\nitself and done the business. I was embarrassed, Jim he was embarrassed, and\r\nneither of us couldn’t say a word. Well, Tom he glowered at me a minute,\r\nand says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, out with it. What do you think?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, <i>you</i> don’t believe that, yourself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the reason I don’t? What’s to hender me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There’s one thing to hender you: it couldn’t happen,\r\nthat’s all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What’s the reason it couldn’t happen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You tell me the reason it <i>could</i> happen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This balloon is a good enough reason it could happen, I should\r\nreckon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Why</i> is it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Why</i> is it? I never saw such an idiot. Ain’t this balloon\r\nand the bronze horse the same thing under different names?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, they’re not. One is a balloon and the other’s a horse.\r\nIt’s very different. Next you’ll be saying a house and a cow is the\r\nsame thing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“By Jackson, Huck’s got him ag’in! Dey ain’t no\r\nwigglin’ outer dat!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shut your head, Jim; you don’t know what you’re talking\r\nabout. And Huck don’t. Look here, Huck, I’ll make it plain to you,\r\nso you can understand. You see, it ain’t the mere <i>form</i>\r\nthat’s got anything to do with their being similar or unsimilar,\r\nit’s the <i>principle</i> involved; and the principle is the same in\r\nboth. Don’t you see, now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI turned it over in my mind, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom, it ain’t no use. Principles is all very well, but they\r\ndon’t git around that one big fact, that the thing that a balloon can do\r\nain’t no sort of proof of what a horse can do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shucks, Huck, you don’t get the idea at all. Now look here a\r\nminute—it’s perfectly plain. Don’t we fly through the\r\nair?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very well. Don’t we fly high or fly low, just as we please?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t we steer whichever way we want to?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And don’t we land when and where we please?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How do we move the balloon and steer it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“By touching the buttons.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Now</i> I reckon the thing is clear to you at last. In the other case\r\nthe moving and steering was done by turning a peg. We touch a button, the\r\nprince turned a peg. There ain’t an atom of difference, you see. I knowed\r\nI could git it through your head if I stuck to it long enough.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe felt so happy he begun to whistle. But me and Jim was silent, so he broke\r\noff surprised, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Looky here, Huck Finn, don’t you see it <i>yet?</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Tom Sawyer, I want to ask you some questions.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Go ahead,” he says, and I see Jim chirk up to listen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As I understand it, the whole thing is in the buttons and the\r\npeg—the rest ain’t of no consequence. A button is one shape, a peg\r\nis another shape, but that ain’t any matter?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, that ain’t any matter, as long as they’ve both got the\r\nsame power.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, then. What is the power that’s in a candle and in a\r\nmatch?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s the fire.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s the same in both, then?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, just the same in both.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right. Suppose I set fire to a carpenter shop with a match, what\r\nwill happen to that carpenter shop?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She’ll burn up.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And suppose I set fire to this pyramid with a candle—will she burn\r\nup?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course she won’t.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right. Now the fire’s the same, both times. <i>Why</i> does\r\nthe shop burn, and the pyramid don’t?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because the pyramid <i>can’t</i> burn.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Aha! and <i>a horse can’t fly!</i>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My lan’, ef Huck ain’t got him ag’in! Huck’s\r\nlanded him high en dry dis time, I tell you! Hit’s de smartes’ trap\r\nI ever see a body walk inter—en ef I—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldn’t go on, and\r\nTom was that mad to see how neat I had floored him, and turned his own argument\r\nag’in him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it, that all he\r\ncould manage to say was that whenever he heard me and Jim try to argue it made\r\nhim ashamed of the human race. I never said nothing; I was feeling pretty well\r\nsatisfied. When I have got the best of a person that way, it ain’t my way\r\nto go around crowing about it the way some people does, for I consider that if\r\nI was in his place I wouldn’t wish him to crow over me. It’s better\r\nto be generous, that’s what I think.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"link2HCH0013\"></a>\r\nCHAPTER XIII.<br>\r\nGOING FOR TOM’S PIPE:</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nBy and by we left Jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of the\r\npyramids, and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel, and went\r\nin with some Arabs and candles, and away in there in the middle of the pyramid\r\nwe found a room and a big stone box in it where they used to keep that king,\r\njust as the man in the Sunday-school said; but he was gone, now; somebody had\r\ngot him. But I didn’t take no interest in the place, because there could\r\nbe ghosts there, of course; not fresh ones, but I don’t like no kind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece, and then went\r\nin a boat another piece, and then more donkeys, and got to Cairo; and all the\r\nway the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever I see, and had tall\r\ndate-pa’ms on both sides, and naked children everywhere, and the men was\r\nas red as copper, and fine and strong and handsome. And the city was a\r\ncuriosity. Such narrow streets—why, they were just lanes, and crowded\r\nwith people with turbans, and women with veils, and everybody rigged out in\r\nblazing bright clothes and all sorts of colors, and you wondered how the camels\r\nand the people got by each other in such narrow little cracks, but they done\r\nit—a perfect jam, you see, and everybody noisy. The stores warn’t\r\nbig enough to turn around in, but you didn’t have to go in; the\r\nstorekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter, smoking his snaky long pipe, and\r\nhad his things where he could reach them to sell, and he was just as good as in\r\nthe street, for the camel-loads brushed him as they went by.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men\r\nrunning and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod that\r\ndidn’t get out of the way. And by and by along comes the Sultan riding\r\nhorseback at the head of a procession, and fairly took your breath away his\r\nclothes was so splendid; and everybody fell flat and laid on his stomach while\r\nhe went by. I forgot, but a feller helped me to remember. He was one that had a\r\nrod and run in front.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was churches, but they don’t know enough to keep Sunday; they keep\r\nFriday and break the Sabbath. You have to take off your shoes when you go in.\r\nThere was crowds of men and boys in the church, setting in groups on the stone\r\nfloor and making no end of noise—getting their lessons by heart, Tom\r\nsaid, out of the Koran, which they think is a Bible, and people that knows\r\nbetter knows enough to not let on. I never see such a big church in my life\r\nbefore, and most awful high, it was; it made you dizzy to look up; our village\r\nchurch at home ain’t a circumstance to it; if you was to put it in there,\r\npeople would think it was a drygoods box.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat I wanted to see was a dervish, because I was interested in dervishes on\r\naccounts of the one that played the trick on the camel-driver. So we found a\r\nlot in a kind of a church, and they called themselves Whirling Dervishes; and\r\nthey did whirl, too. I never see anything like it. They had tall sugar-loaf\r\nhats on, and linen petticoats; and they spun and spun and spun, round and round\r\nlike tops, and the petticoats stood out on a slant, and it was the prettiest\r\nthing I ever see, and made me drunk to look at it. They was all Moslems, Tom\r\nsaid, and when I asked him what a Moslem was, he said it was a person that\r\nwasn’t a Presbyterian. So there is plenty of them in Missouri, though I\r\ndidn’t know it before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe didn’t see half there was to see in Cairo, because Tom was in such a\r\nsweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history. We had a most tiresome\r\ntime to find the granary where Joseph stored up the grain before the famine,\r\nand when we found it it warn’t worth much to look at, being such an old\r\ntumble-down wreck; but Tom was satisfied, and made more fuss over it than I\r\nwould make if I stuck a nail in my foot. How he ever found that place was too\r\nmany for me. We passed as much as forty just like it before we come to it, and\r\nany of them would ’a’ done for me, but none but just the right one\r\nwould suit him; I never see anybody so particular as Tom Sawyer. The minute he\r\nstruck the right one he reconnized it as easy as I would reconnize my other\r\nshirt if I had one, but how he done it he couldn’t any more tell than he\r\ncould fly; he said so himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learned the\r\ncadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones, and said it was\r\nout of the Arabian Nights, and he would tell me and Jim about it when he got\r\ntime. Well, we hunted and hunted till I was ready to drop, and I wanted Tom to\r\ngive it up and come next day and git somebody that knowed the town and could\r\ntalk Missourian and could go straight to the place; but no, he wanted to find\r\nit himself, and nothing else would answer. So on we went. Then at last the\r\nremarkablest thing happened I ever see. The house was gone—gone hundreds\r\nof years ago—every last rag of it gone but just one mud brick. Now a\r\nperson wouldn’t ever believe that a backwoods Missouri boy that\r\nhadn’t ever been in that town before could go and hunt that place over\r\nand find that brick, but Tom Sawyer done it. I know he done it, because I see\r\nhim do it. I was right by his very side at the time, and see him see the brick\r\nand see him reconnize it. Well, I says to myself, how <i>does</i> he do it? Is\r\nit knowledge, or is it instink?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNow there’s the facts, just as they happened: let everybody explain it\r\ntheir own way. I’ve ciphered over it a good deal, and it’s my\r\nopinion that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink. The\r\nreason is this: Tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his\r\nname on it and the facts when he went home, and I slipped it out and put\r\nanother brick considerable like it in its place, and he didn’t know the\r\ndifference—but there was a difference, you see. I think that settles\r\nit—it’s mostly instink, not knowledge. Instink tells him where the\r\nexact <i>place</i> is for the brick to be in, and so he reconnizes it by the\r\nplace it’s in, not by the look of the brick. If it was knowledge, not\r\ninstink, he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen\r\nit—which he didn’t. So it shows that for all the brag you hear\r\nabout knowledge being such a wonderful thing, instink is worth forty of it for\r\nreal unerringness. Jim says the same.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we got back Jim dropped down and took us in, and there was a young man\r\nthere with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket and baggy\r\ntrousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that could talk\r\nEnglish and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to Mecca and Medina and\r\nCentral Africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day and his keep, and we\r\nhired him and left, and piled on the power, and by the time we was through\r\ndinner we was over the place where the Israelites crossed the Red Sea when\r\nPharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught by the waters. We stopped, then,\r\nand had a good look at the place, and it done Jim good to see it. He said he\r\ncould see it all, now, just the way it happened; he could see the Israelites\r\nwalking along between the walls of water, and the Egyptians coming, from away\r\noff yonder, hurrying all they could, and see them start in as the Israelites\r\nwent out, and then when they was all in, see the walls tumble together and\r\ndrown the last man of them. Then we piled on the power again and rushed away\r\nand huvvered over Mount Sinai, and saw the place where Moses broke the tables\r\nof stone, and where the children of Israel camped in the plain and worshiped\r\nthe golden calf, and it was all just as interesting as could be, and the guide\r\nknowed every place as well as I knowed the village at home.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut we had an accident, now, and it fetched all the plans to a standstill.\r\nTom’s old ornery corn-cob pipe had got so old and swelled and warped that\r\nshe couldn’t hold together any longer, notwithstanding the strings and\r\nbandages, but caved in and went to pieces. Tom he didn’t know <i>what</i>\r\nto do. The professor’s pipe wouldn’t answer; it warn’t\r\nanything but a mershum, and a person that’s got used to a cob pipe knows\r\nit lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world, and you can’t\r\ngit him to smoke any other. He wouldn’t take mine, I couldn’t\r\npersuade him. So there he was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe thought it over, and said we must scour around and see if we could roust out\r\none in Egypt or Arabia or around in some of these countries, but the guide said\r\nno, it warn’t no use, they didn’t have them. So Tom was pretty glum\r\nfor a little while, then he chirked up and said he’d got the idea and\r\nknowed what to do. He says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I’ve got another corn-cob pipe, and it’s a prime one, too,\r\nand nearly new. It’s laying on the rafter that’s right over the\r\nkitchen stove at home in the village. Jim, you and the guide will go and get\r\nit, and me and Huck will camp here on Mount Sinai till you come back.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But, Mars Tom, we couldn’t ever find de village. I could find de\r\npipe, ’case I knows de kitchen, but my lan’, we can’t ever\r\nfind de village, nur Sent Louis, nur none o’ dem places. We don’t\r\nknow de way, Mars Tom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat was a fact, and it stumped Tom for a minute. Then he said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Looky here, it can be done, sure; and I’ll tell you how. You set\r\nyour compass and sail west as straight as a dart, till you find the United\r\nStates. It ain’t any trouble, because it’s the first land\r\nyou’ll strike the other side of the Atlantic. If it’s daytime when\r\nyou strike it, bulge right on, straight west from the upper part of the Florida\r\ncoast, and in an hour and three quarters you’ll hit the mouth of the\r\nMississippi—at the speed that I’m going to send you. You’ll\r\nbe so high up in the air that the earth will be curved\r\nconsiderable—sorter like a washbowl turned upside down—and\r\nyou’ll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way, long before\r\nyou get there, and you can pick out the Mississippi without any trouble. Then\r\nyou can follow the river north nearly, an hour and three quarters, till you see\r\nthe Ohio come in; then you want to look sharp, because you’re getting\r\nnear. Away up to your left you’ll see another thread coming\r\nin—that’s the Missouri and is a little above St. Louis.\r\nYou’ll come down low then, so as you can examine the villages as you spin\r\nalong. You’ll pass about twenty-five in the next fifteen minutes, and\r\nyou’ll recognize ours when you see it—and if you don’t, you\r\ncan yell down and ask.”\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"496\" src=\"images/%7B0167%7D.jpg\" width=\"700\" id=\"id-6427051806693865283\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“Map of the trip made by Tom Sawyer Erronott 1850”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ef it’s dat easy, Mars Tom, I reckon we kin do it—yassir, I\r\nknows we kin.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe guide was sure of it, too, and thought that he could learn to stand his\r\nwatch in a little while.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour,” Tom said.\r\n“This balloon’s as easy to manage as a canoe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it, and says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To go back west is the shortest way, you see. It’s only about\r\nseven thousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it’s over twice\r\nas far.” Then he says to the guide, “I want you both to watch the\r\ntell-tale all through the watches, and whenever it don’t mark three\r\nhundred miles an hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a\r\nstorm-current that’s going your way. There’s a hundred miles an\r\nhour in this old thing without any wind to help. There’s two-hundred-mile\r\ngales to be found, any time you want to hunt for them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We’ll hunt for them, sir.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“See that you do. Sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles, and\r\nit’ll be p’ison cold, but most of the time you’ll find your\r\nstorm a good deal lower. If you can only strike a cyclone—that’s\r\nthe ticket for you! You’ll see by the professor’s books that they\r\ntravel west in these latitudes; and they travel low, too.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he ciphered on the time, and says—\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Seven thousand miles, three hundred miles an hour—you can make the\r\ntrip in a day—twenty-four hours. This is Thursday; you’ll be back\r\nhere Saturday afternoon. Come, now, hustle out some blankets and food and books\r\nand things for me and Huck, and you can start right along. There ain’t no\r\noccasion to fool around—I want a smoke, and the quicker you fetch that\r\npipe the better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll hands jumped for the things, and in eight minutes our things was out and\r\nthe balloon was ready for America. So we shook hands good-bye, and Tom gave his\r\nlast orders:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s 10 minutes to 2 P.M. now, Mount Sinai time. In 24 hours\r\nyou’ll be home, and it’ll be 6 to-morrow morning, village time.\r\nWhen you strike the village, land a little back of the top of the hill, in the\r\nwoods, out of sight; then you rush down, Jim, and shove these letters in the\r\npost-office, and if you see anybody stirring, pull your slouch down over your\r\nface so they won’t know you. Then you go and slip in the back way to the\r\nkitchen and git the pipe, and lay this piece of paper on the kitchen table, and\r\nput something on it to hold it, and then slide out and git away, and\r\ndon’t let Aunt Polly catch a sight of you, nor nobody else. Then you jump\r\nfor the balloon and shove for Mount Sinai three hundred miles an hour. You\r\nwon’t have lost more than an hour. You’ll start back at 7 or 8\r\nA.M., village time, and be here in 24 hours, arriving at 2 or 3 P.M., Mount\r\nSinai time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTom he read the piece of paper to us. He had wrote on it:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\n“T<small>HURSDAY</small> A<small>FTERNOON</small>. Tom Sawyer the\r\nErronort sends his love to Aunt Polly from Mount Sinai where the Ark was, and\r\nso does Huck Finn, and she will get it to-morrow morning half-past six.”*\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\n“T<small>OM</small> S<small>AWYER THE</small>\r\nE<small>RRONORT</small>”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"footnote\">\r\n* This misplacing of the Ark is probably Huck’s error, not\r\nTom’s.—M.T.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That’ll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come,” he\r\nsays. Then he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stand by! One—two—three—away you go!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd away she <i>did</i> go! Why, she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big plain,\r\nand there we camped to wait for the pipe.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">\r\nThe balloon come back all right, and brung the pipe; but Aunt Polly had catched\r\nJim when he was getting it, and anybody can guess what happened: she sent for\r\nTom. So Jim he says:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mars Tom, she’s out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky\r\na-layin’ for you, en she say she ain’t gwyne to budge from dah tell\r\nshe gits hold of you. Dey’s gwyne to be trouble, Mars Tom, ’deed\r\ndey is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo then we shoved for home, and not feeling very gay, neither.\r\n</p>\r\n<div class=\"fig\" style=\"width:100%;\">\r\n<img alt=\"[Illustration]\" height=\"411\" src=\"images/%7B0171%7D.jpg\" width=\"600\" id=\"id-4687989405579136960\">\r\n<p class=\"caption\">“Homeward bound”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SAWYER ABROAD ***</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

To reveal art and conceal the\r\nartist is art’s aim. The critic is he who can translate into another\r\nmanner or a new material his impression of beautiful things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography. Those\r\nwho find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.\r\nThis is a fault.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThose who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated. For\r\nthese there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only\r\nbeauty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written,\r\nor badly written. That is all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his own\r\nface in a glass.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing\r\nhis own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter\r\nof the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an\r\nimperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even things that are\r\ntrue can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an\r\nartist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No artist is ever morbid. The\r\nartist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist\r\ninstruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.\r\nFrom the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the\r\nmusician. From the point of view of feeling, the actor’s craft is the\r\ntype. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface\r\ndo so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the\r\nspectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a\r\nwork of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When critics\r\ndisagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making\r\na useful thing as long as he does not admire it. The only excuse for making a\r\nuseless thing is that one admires it intensely.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll art is quite useless.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"right\">\r\nOSCAR WILDE\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap01\"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer\r\nwind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door\r\nthe heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the\r\npink-flowering thorn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying,\r\nsmoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could\r\njust catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a\r\nlaburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a\r\nbeauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds\r\nin flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in\r\nfront of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and\r\nmaking him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the\r\nmedium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of\r\nswiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way\r\nthrough the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the\r\ndusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more\r\noppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant\r\norgan.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length\r\nportrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it,\r\nsome little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward,\r\nwhose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public\r\nexcitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully\r\nmirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed\r\nabout to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and closing his eyes, placed\r\nhis fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain\r\nsome curious dream from which he feared he might awake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,”\r\nsaid Lord Henry languidly. “You must certainly send it next year to the\r\nGrosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there,\r\nthere have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the\r\npictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to\r\nsee the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t think I shall send it anywhere,” he answered,\r\ntossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at\r\nhim at Oxford. “No, I won’t send it anywhere.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the\r\nthin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his\r\nheavy, opium-tainted cigarette. “Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow,\r\nwhy? Have you any reason? What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in\r\nthe world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to\r\nthrow it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world\r\nworse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait\r\nlike this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the\r\nold men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know you will laugh at me,” he replied, “but I really\r\ncan’t exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Too much of yourself in it! Upon my word, Basil, I didn’t know you\r\nwere so vain; and I really can’t see any resemblance between you, with\r\nyour rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who\r\nlooks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is\r\na Narcissus, and you—well, of course you have an intellectual expression\r\nand all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression\r\nbegins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony\r\nof any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all\r\nforehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned\r\nprofessions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church.\r\nBut then in the Church they don’t think. A bishop keeps on saying at the\r\nage of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a\r\nnatural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious\r\nyoung friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really\r\nfascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless\r\nbeautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers\r\nto look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our\r\nintelligence. Don’t flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least\r\nlike him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist.\r\n“Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I\r\nshould be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you\r\nthe truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction,\r\nthe sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of\r\nkings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows. The ugly and\r\nthe stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and\r\ngape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the\r\nknowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live—undisturbed,\r\nindifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor\r\never receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such\r\nas they are—my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good\r\nlooks—we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer\r\nterribly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian Gray? Is that his name?” asked Lord Henry, walking across\r\nthe studio towards Basil Hallward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, that is his name. I didn’t intend to tell it to you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But why not?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I can’t explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell\r\ntheir names to any one. It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to\r\nlove secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious\r\nor marvellous to us. The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it.\r\nWhen I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going. If I did, I\r\nwould lose all my pleasure. It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it\r\nseems to bring a great deal of romance into one’s life. I suppose you\r\nthink me awfully foolish about it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not at all,” answered Lord Henry, “not at all, my dear\r\nBasil. You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is\r\nthat it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties. I\r\nnever know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. When we\r\nmeet—we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to\r\nthe Duke’s—we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most\r\nserious faces. My wife is very good at it—much better, in fact, than I\r\nam. She never gets confused over her dates, and I always do. But when she does\r\nfind me out, she makes no row at all. I sometimes wish she would; but she\r\nmerely laughs at me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,” said\r\nBasil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden. “I\r\nbelieve that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly\r\nashamed of your own virtues. You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a\r\nmoral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a\r\npose.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I\r\nknow,” cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into\r\nthe garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood\r\nin the shade of a tall laurel bush. The sunlight slipped over the polished\r\nleaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his watch. “I am afraid I must be\r\ngoing, Basil,” he murmured, “and before I go, I insist on your\r\nanswering a question I put to you some time ago.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is that?” said the painter, keeping his eyes fixed on the\r\nground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You know quite well.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you\r\nwon’t exhibit Dorian Gray’s picture. I want the real reason.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I told you the real reason.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself\r\nin it. Now, that is childish.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry,” said Basil Hallward, looking him straight in the face,\r\n“every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist,\r\nnot of the sitter. The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. It is not\r\nhe who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the\r\ncoloured canvas, reveals himself. The reason I will not exhibit this picture is\r\nthat I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry laughed. “And what is that?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will tell you,” said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity\r\ncame over his face.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am all expectation, Basil,” continued his companion, glancing at\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,” answered the\r\npainter; “and I am afraid you will hardly understand it. Perhaps you will\r\nhardly believe it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the\r\ngrass and examined it. “I am quite sure I shall understand it,” he\r\nreplied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, “and\r\nas for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite\r\nincredible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with\r\ntheir clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air. A grasshopper\r\nbegan to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly\r\nfloated past on its brown gauze wings. Lord Henry felt as if he could hear\r\nBasil Hallward’s heart beating, and wondered what was coming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The story is simply this,” said the painter after some time.\r\n“Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon’s. You know we\r\npoor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to\r\nremind the public that we are not savages. With an evening coat and a white\r\ntie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation\r\nfor being civilized. Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes,\r\ntalking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly\r\nbecame conscious that some one was looking at me. I turned half-way round and\r\nsaw Dorian Gray for the first time. When our eyes met, I felt that I was\r\ngrowing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I knew that I had\r\ncome face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that,\r\nif I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my\r\nvery art itself. I did not want any external influence in my life. You know\r\nyourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own\r\nmaster; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray. Then—but I\r\ndon’t know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I\r\nwas on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life. I had a strange feeling that\r\nfate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid\r\nand turned to quit the room. It was not conscience that made me do so: it was a\r\nsort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience\r\nis the trade-name of the firm. That is all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t believe that, Harry, and I don’t believe you do\r\neither. However, whatever was my motive—and it may have been pride, for I\r\nused to be very proud—I certainly struggled to the door. There, of\r\ncourse, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. ‘You are not going to run away\r\nso soon, Mr. Hallward?’ she screamed out. You know her curiously shrill\r\nvoice?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; she is a peacock in everything but beauty,” said Lord Henry,\r\npulling the daisy to bits with his long nervous fingers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I could not get rid of her. She brought me up to royalties, and people\r\nwith stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot\r\nnoses. She spoke of me as her dearest friend. I had only met her once before,\r\nbut she took it into her head to lionize me. I believe some picture of mine had\r\nmade a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the\r\npenny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.\r\nSuddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had\r\nso strangely stirred me. We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met\r\nagain. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him.\r\nPerhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would\r\nhave spoken to each other without any introduction. I am sure of that. Dorian\r\ntold me so afterwards. He, too, felt that we were destined to know each\r\nother.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?” asked\r\nhis companion. “I know she goes in for giving a rapid <i>précis</i> of\r\nall her guests. I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old\r\ngentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in\r\na tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the\r\nroom, the most astounding details. I simply fled. I like to find out people for\r\nmyself. But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his\r\ngoods. She either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about\r\nthem except what one wants to know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Poor Lady Brandon! You are hard on her, Harry!” said Hallward\r\nlistlessly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear fellow, she tried to found a <i>salon</i>, and only succeeded in\r\nopening a restaurant. How could I admire her? But tell me, what did she say\r\nabout Mr. Dorian Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, something like, ‘Charming boy—poor dear mother and I\r\nabsolutely inseparable. Quite forget what he does—afraid\r\nhe—doesn’t do anything—oh, yes, plays the piano—or is\r\nit the violin, dear Mr. Gray?’ Neither of us could help laughing, and we\r\nbecame friends at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far\r\nthe best ending for one,” said the young lord, plucking another daisy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward shook his head. “You don’t understand what friendship is,\r\nHarry,” he murmured—“or what enmity is, for that matter. You\r\nlike every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How horribly unjust of you!” cried Lord Henry, tilting his hat\r\nback and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy\r\nwhite silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky.\r\n“Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people. I\r\nchoose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good\r\ncharacters, and my enemies for their good intellects. A man cannot be too\r\ncareful in the choice of his enemies. I have not got one who is a fool. They\r\nare all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate\r\nme. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be\r\nmerely an acquaintance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, brothers! I don’t care for brothers. My elder brother\r\nwon’t die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry!” exclaimed Hallward, frowning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can’t help detesting\r\nmy relations. I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other\r\npeople having the same faults as ourselves. I quite sympathize with the rage of\r\nthe English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders. The\r\nmasses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own\r\nspecial property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he is\r\npoaching on their preserves. When poor Southwark got into the divorce court,\r\ntheir indignation was quite magnificent. And yet I don’t suppose that ten\r\nper cent of the proletariat live correctly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t agree with a single word that you have said, and, what is\r\nmore, Harry, I feel sure you don’t either.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his\r\npatent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane. “How English you are\r\nBasil! That is the second time you have made that observation. If one puts\r\nforward an idea to a true Englishman—always a rash thing to do—he\r\nnever dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong. The only thing\r\nhe considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself. Now, the\r\nvalue of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who\r\nexpresses it. Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is,\r\nthe more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be\r\ncoloured by either his wants, his desires, or his prejudices. However, I\r\ndon’t propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you. I\r\nlike persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles\r\nbetter than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray. How\r\noften do you see him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Every day. I couldn’t be happy if I didn’t see him every\r\nday. He is absolutely necessary to me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your\r\nart.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is all my art to me now,” said the painter gravely. “I\r\nsometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the\r\nworld’s history. The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and\r\nthe second is the appearance of a new personality for art also. What the\r\ninvention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to\r\nlate Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me. It is\r\nnot merely that I paint from him, draw from him, sketch from him. Of course, I\r\nhave done all that. But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I\r\nwon’t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him, or\r\nthat his beauty is such that art cannot express it. There is nothing that art\r\ncannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray,\r\nis good work, is the best work of my life. But in some curious way—I\r\nwonder will you understand me?—his personality has suggested to me an\r\nentirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style. I see things\r\ndifferently, I think of them differently. I can now recreate life in a way that\r\nwas hidden from me before. ‘A dream of form in days of\r\nthought’—who is it who says that? I forget; but it is what Dorian\r\nGray has been to me. The merely visible presence of this lad—for he seems\r\nto me little more than a lad, though he is really over twenty—his merely\r\nvisible presence—ah! I wonder can you realize all that that means?\r\nUnconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is\r\nto have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the\r\nspirit that is Greek. The harmony of soul and body—how much that is! We\r\nin our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is\r\nvulgar, an ideality that is void. Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is\r\nto me! You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a\r\nhuge price but which I would not part with? It is one of the best things I have\r\never done. And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat\r\nbeside me. Some subtle influence passed from him to me, and for the first time\r\nin my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and\r\nalways missed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil, this is extraordinary! I must see Dorian Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After some\r\ntime he came back. “Harry,” he said, “Dorian Gray is to me\r\nsimply a motive in art. You might see nothing in him. I see everything in him.\r\nHe is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there. He is a\r\nsuggestion, as I have said, of a new manner. I find him in the curves of\r\ncertain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That is\r\nall.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then why won’t you exhibit his portrait?” asked Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all\r\nthis curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to\r\nspeak to him. He knows nothing about it. He shall never know anything about it.\r\nBut the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow\r\nprying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope. There is too\r\nmuch of myself in the thing, Harry—too much of myself!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Poets are not so scrupulous as you are. They know how useful passion is\r\nfor publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hate them for it,” cried Hallward. “An artist should\r\ncreate beautiful things, but should put nothing of his own life into them. We\r\nlive in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of\r\nautobiography. We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. Some day I will show\r\nthe world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait\r\nof Dorian Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won’t argue with you. It is\r\nonly the intellectually lost who ever argue. Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond\r\nof you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he\r\nanswered after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him\r\ndreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I\r\nshall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in\r\nthe studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he is horribly\r\nthoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel,\r\nHarry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it\r\nwere a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an\r\nornament for a summer’s day.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,” murmured Lord Henry.\r\n“Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will. It is a sad thing to think\r\nof, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That accounts\r\nfor the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. In the wild\r\nstruggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill\r\nour minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place. The\r\nthoroughly well-informed man—that is the modern ideal. And the mind of\r\nthe thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a\r\n<i>bric-à-brac</i> shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above\r\nits proper value. I think you will tire first, all the same. Some day you will\r\nlook at your friend, and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or\r\nyou won’t like his tone of colour, or something. You will bitterly\r\nreproach him in your own heart, and seriously think that he has behaved very\r\nbadly to you. The next time he calls, you will be perfectly cold and\r\nindifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you. What you have told\r\nme is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of\r\nhaving a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, don’t talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of\r\nDorian Gray will dominate me. You can’t feel what I feel. You change too\r\noften.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are\r\nfaithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know\r\nlove’s tragedies.” And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver\r\ncase and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as\r\nif he had summed up the world in a phrase. There was a rustle of chirruping\r\nsparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows\r\nchased themselves across the grass like swallows. How pleasant it was in the\r\ngarden! And how delightful other people’s emotions were!—much more\r\ndelightful than their ideas, it seemed to him. One’s own soul, and the\r\npassions of one’s friends—those were the fascinating things in\r\nlife. He pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he\r\nhad missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward. Had he gone to his\r\naunt’s, he would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the\r\nwhole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the\r\nnecessity for model lodging-houses. Each class would have preached the\r\nimportance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their\r\nown lives. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle\r\ngrown eloquent over the dignity of labour. It was charming to have escaped all\r\nthat! As he thought of his aunt, an idea seemed to strike him. He turned to\r\nHallward and said, “My dear fellow, I have just remembered.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Remembered what, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where was it?” asked Hallward, with a slight frown.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady\r\nAgatha’s. She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was\r\ngoing to help her in the East End, and that his name was Dorian Gray. I am\r\nbound to state that she never told me he was good-looking. Women have no\r\nappreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. She said that he was\r\nvery earnest and had a beautiful nature. I at once pictured to myself a\r\ncreature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about\r\non huge feet. I wish I had known it was your friend.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am very glad you didn’t, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t want you to meet him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t want me to meet him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,” said the butler, coming\r\ninto the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You must introduce me now,” cried Lord Henry, laughing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter turned to his servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.\r\n“Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments.” The\r\nman bowed and went up the walk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he looked at Lord Henry. “Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,”\r\nhe said. “He has a simple and a beautiful nature. Your aunt was quite\r\nright in what she said of him. Don’t spoil him. Don’t try to\r\ninfluence him. Your influence would be bad. The world is wide, and has many\r\nmarvellous people in it. Don’t take away from me the one person who gives\r\nto my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him.\r\nMind, Harry, I trust you.” He spoke very slowly, and the words seemed\r\nwrung out of him almost against his will.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What nonsense you talk!” said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking\r\nHallward by the arm, he almost led him into the house.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAs they entered they saw Dorian Gray. He was seated at the piano, with his back\r\nto them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann’s “Forest\r\nScenes.” “You must lend me these, Basil,” he cried. “I\r\nwant to learn them. They are perfectly charming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don’t want a life-sized portrait\r\nof myself,” answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a\r\nwilful, petulant manner. When he caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush\r\ncoloured his cheeks for a moment, and he started up. “I beg your pardon,\r\nBasil, but I didn’t know you had any one with you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine. I have\r\njust been telling him what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled\r\neverything.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,” said\r\nLord Henry, stepping forward and extending his hand. “My aunt has often\r\nspoken to me about you. You are one of her favourites, and, I am afraid, one of\r\nher victims also.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am in Lady Agatha’s black books at present,” answered\r\nDorian with a funny look of penitence. “I promised to go to a club in\r\nWhitechapel with her last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it. We were to\r\nhave played a duet together—three duets, I believe. I don’t know\r\nwhat she will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She is quite devoted to you.\r\nAnd I don’t think it really matters about your not being there. The\r\naudience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to the\r\npiano, she makes quite enough noise for two people.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is very horrid to her, and not very nice to me,” answered\r\nDorian, laughing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry looked at him. Yes, he was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his\r\nfinely curved scarlet lips, his frank blue eyes, his crisp gold hair. There was\r\nsomething in his face that made one trust him at once. All the candour of youth\r\nwas there, as well as all youth’s passionate purity. One felt that he had\r\nkept himself unspotted from the world. No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray—far too\r\ncharming.” And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his\r\ncigarette-case.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready. He\r\nwas looking worried, and when he heard Lord Henry’s last remark, he\r\nglanced at him, hesitated for a moment, and then said, “Harry, I want to\r\nfinish this picture to-day. Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked\r\nyou to go away?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray. “Am I to go, Mr.\r\nGray?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, please don’t, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his\r\nsulky moods, and I can’t bear him when he sulks. Besides, I want you to\r\ntell me why I should not go in for philanthropy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray. It is so\r\ntedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I\r\ncertainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop. You\r\ndon’t really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked\r\nyour sitters to have some one to chat to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward bit his lip. “If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay.\r\nDorian’s whims are laws to everybody, except himself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry took up his hat and gloves. “You are very pressing, Basil, but\r\nI am afraid I must go. I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans. Good-bye,\r\nMr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street. I am nearly always\r\nat home at five o’clock. Write to me when you are coming. I should be\r\nsorry to miss you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil,” cried Dorian Gray, “if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I\r\nshall go, too. You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is\r\nhorribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant. Ask him to\r\nstay. I insist upon it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,” said Hallward,\r\ngazing intently at his picture. “It is quite true, I never talk when I am\r\nworking, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my\r\nunfortunate sitters. I beg you to stay.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But what about my man at the Orleans?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter laughed. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty\r\nabout that. Sit down again, Harry. And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and\r\ndon’t move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says.\r\nHe has a very bad influence over all his friends, with the single exception of\r\nmyself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr, and\r\nmade a little <i>moue</i> of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he had rather\r\ntaken a fancy. He was so unlike Basil. They made a delightful contrast. And he\r\nhad such a beautiful voice. After a few moments he said to him, “Have you\r\nreally a very bad influence, Lord Henry? As bad as Basil says?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is\r\nimmoral—immoral from the scientific point of view.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He\r\ndoes not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His\r\nvirtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are\r\nborrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part\r\nthat has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To\r\nrealize one’s nature perfectly—that is what each of us is here for.\r\nPeople are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of\r\nall duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course, they are\r\ncharitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls\r\nstarve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never\r\nreally had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror\r\nof God, which is the secret of religion—these are the two things that\r\ngovern us. And yet—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good\r\nboy,” said the painter, deep in his work and conscious only that a look\r\nhad come into the lad’s face that he had never seen there before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And yet,” continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and\r\nwith that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him,\r\nand that he had even in his Eton days, “I believe that if one man were to\r\nlive out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling,\r\nexpression to every thought, reality to every dream—I believe that the\r\nworld would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the\r\nmaladies of mediævalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal—to something\r\nfiner, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst\r\nus is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival\r\nin the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals. Every\r\nimpulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body\r\nsins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.\r\nNothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a\r\nregret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it,\r\nand your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to\r\nitself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and\r\nunlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the\r\nbrain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world\r\ntake place also. You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your\r\nrose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts\r\nthat have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere\r\nmemory might stain your cheek with shame—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stop!” faltered Dorian Gray, “stop! you bewilder me. I\r\ndon’t know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find\r\nit. Don’t speak. Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to\r\nthink.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes\r\nstrangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at\r\nwork within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. The\r\nfew words that Basil’s friend had said to him—words spoken by\r\nchance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them—had touched some secret\r\nchord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating\r\nand throbbing to curious pulses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMusic had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But music\r\nwas not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it\r\ncreated in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid,\r\nand cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there\r\nwas in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things,\r\nand to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere\r\nwords! Was there anything so real as words?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He\r\nunderstood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to\r\nhim that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known it?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith his subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him. He knew the precise\r\npsychological moment when to say nothing. He felt intensely interested. He was\r\namazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced, and, remembering a\r\nbook that he had read when he was sixteen, a book which had revealed to him\r\nmuch that he had not known before, he wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing\r\nthrough a similar experience. He had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it\r\nhit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his, that had the true\r\nrefinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from\r\nstrength. He was unconscious of the silence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil, I am tired of standing,” cried Dorian Gray suddenly.\r\n“I must go out and sit in the garden. The air is stifling here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can’t think\r\nof anything else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And I\r\nhave caught the effect I wanted—the half-parted lips and the bright look\r\nin the eyes. I don’t know what Harry has been saying to you, but he has\r\ncertainly made you have the most wonderful expression. I suppose he has been\r\npaying you compliments. You mustn’t believe a word that he says.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He has certainly not been paying me compliments. Perhaps that is the\r\nreason that I don’t believe anything he has told me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You know you believe it all,” said Lord Henry, looking at him with\r\nhis dreamy languorous eyes. “I will go out to the garden with you. It is\r\nhorribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink,\r\nsomething with strawberries in it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell\r\nhim what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I will join you\r\nlater on. Don’t keep Dorian too long. I have never been in better form\r\nfor painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece. It is my\r\nmasterpiece as it stands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the\r\ngreat cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had\r\nbeen wine. He came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder. “You\r\nare quite right to do that,” he murmured. “Nothing can cure the\r\nsoul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad started and drew back. He was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his\r\nrebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear\r\nin his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely\r\nchiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his\r\nlips and left them trembling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” continued Lord Henry, “that is one of the great\r\nsecrets of life—to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses\r\nby means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you\r\nthink you know, just as you know less than you want to know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking the\r\ntall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic, olive-coloured\r\nface and worn expression interested him. There was something in his low languid\r\nvoice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flowerlike hands, even,\r\nhad a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a\r\nlanguage of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid.\r\nWhy had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known\r\nBasil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered\r\nhim. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have\r\ndisclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid\r\nof? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let us go and sit in the shade,” said Lord Henry. “Parker\r\nhas brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will\r\nbe quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again. You really must not\r\nallow yourself to become sunburnt. It would be unbecoming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What can it matter?” cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he sat down\r\non the seat at the end of the garden.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing\r\nworth having.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled\r\nand ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion\r\nbranded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it\r\nterribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? ...\r\nYou have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don’t frown. You have.\r\nAnd beauty is a form of genius—is higher, indeed, than genius, as it\r\nneeds no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or\r\nspring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the\r\nmoon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes\r\nprinces of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you\r\nwon’t smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial.\r\nThat may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me,\r\nbeauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by\r\nappearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the\r\ninvisible.... Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods\r\ngive they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really,\r\nperfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and\r\nthen you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or\r\nhave to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past\r\nwill make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer\r\nto something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and\r\nyour roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will\r\nsuffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t\r\nsquander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the\r\nhopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the\r\nvulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the\r\nwonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always\r\nsearching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.... A new\r\nHedonism—that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol.\r\nWith your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to\r\nyou for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious\r\nof what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you\r\nthat charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought\r\nhow tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that\r\nyour youth will last—such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither,\r\nbut they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now.\r\nIn a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the\r\ngreen night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our\r\nyouth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs\r\nfail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory\r\nof the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations\r\nthat we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely\r\nnothing in the world but youth!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering. The spray of lilac fell from his\r\nhand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment. Then\r\nit began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. He\r\nwatched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop\r\nwhen things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new\r\nemotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that\r\nterrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield. After a\r\ntime the bee flew away. He saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian\r\nconvolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs\r\nfor them to come in. They turned to each other and smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am waiting,” he cried. “Do come in. The light is quite\r\nperfect, and you can bring your drinks.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey rose up and sauntered down the walk together. Two green-and-white\r\nbutterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the\r\ngarden a thrush began to sing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,” said Lord Henry, looking\r\nat him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.\r\nWomen are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it\r\nlast for ever. It is a meaningless word, too. The only difference between a\r\ncaprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little\r\nlonger.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his hand upon Lord Henry’s\r\narm. “In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,” he murmured,\r\nflushing at his own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his\r\npose.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him. The\r\nsweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the\r\nstillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back to look at his work\r\nfrom a distance. In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway\r\nthe dust danced and was golden. The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood\r\nover everything.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long\r\ntime at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of\r\none of his huge brushes and frowning. “It is quite finished,” he\r\ncried at last, and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on\r\nthe left-hand corner of the canvas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry came over and examined the picture. It was certainly a wonderful\r\nwork of art, and a wonderful likeness as well.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,” he said.\r\n“It is the finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look\r\nat yourself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad started, as if awakened from some dream.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is it really finished?” he murmured, stepping down from the\r\nplatform.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Quite finished,” said the painter. “And you have sat\r\nsplendidly to-day. I am awfully obliged to you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is entirely due to me,” broke in Lord Henry.\r\n“Isn’t it, Mr. Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned\r\ntowards it. When he saw it he drew back, and his cheeks flushed for a moment\r\nwith pleasure. A look of joy came into his eyes, as if he had recognized\r\nhimself for the first time. He stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly\r\nconscious that Hallward was speaking to him, but not catching the meaning of\r\nhis words. The sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation. He had\r\nnever felt it before. Basil Hallward’s compliments had seemed to him to\r\nbe merely the charming exaggeration of friendship. He had listened to them,\r\nlaughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his nature. Then had\r\ncome Lord Henry Wotton with his strange panegyric on youth, his terrible\r\nwarning of its brevity. That had stirred him at the time, and now, as he stood\r\ngazing at the shadow of his own loveliness, the full reality of the description\r\nflashed across him. Yes, there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled\r\nand wizen, his eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his figure broken and\r\ndeformed. The scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his\r\nhair. The life that was to make his soul would mar his body. He would become\r\ndreadful, hideous, and uncouth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and\r\nmade each delicate fibre of his nature quiver. His eyes deepened into amethyst,\r\nand across them came a mist of tears. He felt as if a hand of ice had been laid\r\nupon his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t you like it?” cried Hallward at last, stung a little\r\nby the lad’s silence, not understanding what it meant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course he likes it,” said Lord Henry. “Who wouldn’t\r\nlike it? It is one of the greatest things in modern art. I will give you\r\nanything you like to ask for it. I must have it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is not my property, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Whose property is it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian’s, of course,” answered the painter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is a very lucky fellow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How sad it is!” murmured Dorian Gray with his eyes still fixed\r\nupon his own portrait. “How sad it is! I shall grow old, and horrible,\r\nand dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older\r\nthan this particular day of June.... If it were only the other way! If it were\r\nI who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For\r\nthat—for that—I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the\r\nwhole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,” cried Lord\r\nHenry, laughing. “It would be rather hard lines on your work.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should object very strongly, Harry,” said Hallward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray turned and looked at him. “I believe you would, Basil. You\r\nlike your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze\r\nfigure. Hardly as much, I dare say.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that.\r\nWhat had happened? He seemed quite angry. His face was flushed and his cheeks\r\nburning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” he continued, “I am less to you than your ivory Hermes\r\nor your silver Faun. You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till\r\nI have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses\r\none’s good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything. Your\r\npicture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth is the\r\nonly thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill\r\nmyself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward turned pale and caught his hand. “Dorian! Dorian!” he\r\ncried, “don’t talk like that. I have never had such a friend as\r\nyou, and I shall never have such another. You are not jealous of material\r\nthings, are you?—you who are finer than any of them!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die. I am jealous of\r\nthe portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every\r\nmoment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it. Oh, if it\r\nwere only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always\r\nwhat I am now! Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day—mock me\r\nhorribly!” The hot tears welled into his eyes; he tore his hand away and,\r\nflinging himself on the divan, he buried his face in the cushions, as though he\r\nwas praying.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is your doing, Harry,” said the painter bitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It is the real Dorian Gray—that\r\nis all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is not.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If it is not, what have I to do with it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You should have gone away when I asked you,” he muttered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I stayed when you asked me,” was Lord Henry’s answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, I can’t quarrel with my two best friends at once, but\r\nbetween you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever\r\ndone, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and colour? I will not let\r\nit come across our three lives and mar them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray lifted his golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and\r\ntear-stained eyes, looked at him as he walked over to the deal painting-table\r\nthat was set beneath the high curtained window. What was he doing there? His\r\nfingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes,\r\nseeking for something. Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin\r\nblade of lithe steel. He had found it at last. He was going to rip up the\r\ncanvas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to\r\nHallward, tore the knife out of his hand, and flung it to the end of the\r\nstudio. “Don’t, Basil, don’t!” he cried. “It\r\nwould be murder!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,” said the\r\npainter coldly when he had recovered from his surprise. “I never thought\r\nyou would.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Appreciate it? I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I feel\r\nthat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and\r\nsent home. Then you can do what you like with yourself.” And he walked\r\nacross the room and rang the bell for tea. “You will have tea, of course,\r\nDorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple\r\npleasures?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I adore simple pleasures,” said Lord Henry. “They are the\r\nlast refuge of the complex. But I don’t like scenes, except on the stage.\r\nWhat absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as a\r\nrational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given. Man is many\r\nthings, but he is not rational. I am glad he is not, after all—though I\r\nwish you chaps would not squabble over the picture. You had much better let me\r\nhave it, Basil. This silly boy doesn’t really want it, and I really\r\ndo.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive\r\nyou!” cried Dorian Gray; “and I don’t allow people to call me\r\na silly boy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it\r\nexisted.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you\r\ndon’t really object to being reminded that you are extremely\r\nyoung.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! this morning! You have lived since then.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden tea-tray\r\nand set it down upon a small Japanese table. There was a rattle of cups and\r\nsaucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn. Two globe-shaped china dishes\r\nwere brought in by a page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The\r\ntwo men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the\r\ncovers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let us go to the theatre to-night,” said Lord Henry. “There\r\nis sure to be something on, somewhere. I have promised to dine at\r\nWhite’s, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him a wire to\r\nsay that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a\r\nsubsequent engagement. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would\r\nhave all the surprise of candour.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is such a bore putting on one’s dress-clothes,” muttered\r\nHallward. “And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” answered Lord Henry dreamily, “the costume of the\r\nnineteenth century is detestable. It is so sombre, so depressing. Sin is the\r\nonly real colour-element left in modern life.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one\r\nin the picture?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Before either.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should like to come to the theatre with you, Lord Henry,” said\r\nthe lad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then you shall come; and you will come, too, Basil, won’t\r\nyou?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to\r\ndo.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should like that awfully.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter bit his lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. “I\r\nshall stay with the real Dorian,” he said, sadly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is it the real Dorian?” cried the original of the portrait,\r\nstrolling across to him. “Am I really like that?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; you are just like that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How wonderful, Basil!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“At least you are like it in appearance. But it will never alter,”\r\nsighed Hallward. “That is something.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What a fuss people make about fidelity!” exclaimed Lord Henry.\r\n“Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing\r\nto do with our own will. Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men\r\nwant to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t go to the theatre to-night, Dorian,” said Hallward.\r\n“Stop and dine with me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t, Basil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He won’t like you the better for keeping your promises. He always\r\nbreaks his own. I beg you not to go.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray laughed and shook his head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I entreat you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from\r\nthe tea-table with an amused smile.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I must go, Basil,” he answered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very well,” said Hallward, and he went over and laid down his cup\r\non the tray. “It is rather late, and, as you have to dress, you had\r\nbetter lose no time. Good-bye, Harry. Good-bye, Dorian. Come and see me soon.\r\nCome to-morrow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You won’t forget?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, of course not,” cried Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And ... Harry!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Basil?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Remember what I asked you, when we were in the garden this\r\nmorning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have forgotten it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I trust you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish I could trust myself,” said Lord Henry, laughing.\r\n“Come, Mr. Gray, my hansom is outside, and I can drop you at your own\r\nplace. Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, and a\r\nlook of pain came into his face.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap03\"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAt half-past twelve next day Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over\r\nto the Albany to call on his uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat\r\nrough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it\r\nderived no particular benefit from him, but who was considered generous by\r\nSociety as he fed the people who amused him. His father had been our ambassador\r\nat Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from\r\nthe diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered\r\nthe Embassy at Paris, a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled\r\nby reason of his birth, his indolence, the good English of his dispatches, and\r\nhis inordinate passion for pleasure. The son, who had been his father’s\r\nsecretary, had resigned along with his chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought\r\nat the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself\r\nto the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.\r\nHe had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less\r\ntrouble, and took most of his meals at his club. He paid some attention to the\r\nmanagement of his collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this\r\ntaint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that\r\nit enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth.\r\nIn politics he was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which\r\nperiod he roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals. He was a hero to\r\nhis valet, who bullied him, and a terror to most of his relations, whom he\r\nbullied in turn. Only England could have produced him, and he always said that\r\nthe country was going to the dogs. His principles were out of date, but there\r\nwas a good deal to be said for his prejudices.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Lord Henry entered the room, he found his uncle sitting in a rough\r\nshooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over <i>The Times</i>.\r\n“Well, Harry,” said the old gentleman, “what brings you out\r\nso early? I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible\r\ntill five.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George. I want to get\r\nsomething out of you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Money, I suppose,” said Lord Fermor, making a wry face.\r\n“Well, sit down and tell me all about it. Young people, nowadays, imagine\r\nthat money is everything.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” murmured Lord Henry, settling his button-hole in his coat;\r\n“and when they grow older they know it. But I don’t want money. It\r\nis only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay\r\nmine. Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it.\r\nBesides, I always deal with Dartmoor’s tradesmen, and consequently they\r\nnever bother me. What I want is information: not useful information, of course;\r\nuseless information.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry,\r\nalthough those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense. When I was in the\r\nDiplomatic, things were much better. But I hear they let them in now by\r\nexamination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from\r\nbeginning to end. If a man is a gentleman, he knows quite enough, and if he is\r\nnot a gentleman, whatever he knows is bad for him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,” said\r\nLord Henry languidly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he?” asked Lord Fermor, knitting his bushy\r\nwhite eyebrows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who\r\nhe is. He is the last Lord Kelso’s grandson. His mother was a Devereux,\r\nLady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his mother. What was she\r\nlike? Whom did she marry? You have known nearly everybody in your time, so you\r\nmight have known her. I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have\r\nonly just met him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Kelso’s grandson!” echoed the old gentleman.\r\n“Kelso’s grandson! ... Of course.... I knew his mother intimately.\r\nI believe I was at her christening. She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl,\r\nMargaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a\r\npenniless young fellow—a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot\r\nregiment, or something of that kind. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as\r\nif it happened yesterday. The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few\r\nmonths after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it. They said Kelso\r\ngot some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his son-in-law in\r\npublic—paid him, sir, to do it, paid him—and that the fellow\r\nspitted his man as if he had been a pigeon. The thing was hushed up, but, egad,\r\nKelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. He brought his\r\ndaughter back with him, I was told, and she never spoke to him again. Oh, yes;\r\nit was a bad business. The girl died, too, died within a year. So she left a\r\nson, did she? I had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he? If he is like his\r\nmother, he must be a good-looking chap.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is very good-looking,” assented Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope he will fall into proper hands,” continued the old man.\r\n“He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right\r\nthing by him. His mother had money, too. All the Selby property came to her,\r\nthrough her grandfather. Her grandfather hated Kelso, thought him a mean dog.\r\nHe was, too. Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I was ashamed of him.\r\nThe Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling\r\nwith the cabmen about their fares. They made quite a story of it. I\r\ndidn’t dare show my face at Court for a month. I hope he treated his\r\ngrandson better than he did the jarvies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Lord Henry. “I fancy that the\r\nboy will be well off. He is not of age yet. He has Selby, I know. He told me\r\nso. And ... his mother was very beautiful?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry.\r\nWhat on earth induced her to behave as she did, I never could understand. She\r\ncould have married anybody she chose. Carlington was mad after her. She was\r\nromantic, though. All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot,\r\nbut, egad! the women were wonderful. Carlington went on his knees to her. Told\r\nme so himself. She laughed at him, and there wasn’t a girl in London at\r\nthe time who wasn’t after him. And by the way, Harry, talking about silly\r\nmarriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to\r\nmarry an American? Ain’t English girls good enough for him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle\r\nGeorge.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I’ll back English women against the world, Harry,” said Lord\r\nFermor, striking the table with his fist.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The betting is on the Americans.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They don’t last, I am told,” muttered his uncle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase.\r\nThey take things flying. I don’t think Dartmoor has a chance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who are her people?” grumbled the old gentleman. “Has she\r\ngot any?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry shook his head. “American girls are as clever at concealing\r\ntheir parents, as English women are at concealing their past,” he said,\r\nrising to go.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They are pork-packers, I suppose?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor’s sake. I am told that\r\npork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after\r\npolitics.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is she pretty?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She behaves as if she was beautiful. Most American women do. It is the\r\nsecret of their charm.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why can’t these American women stay in their own country? They are\r\nalways telling us that it is the paradise for women.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious\r\nto get out of it,” said Lord Henry. “Good-bye, Uncle George. I\r\nshall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the\r\ninformation I wanted. I always like to know everything about my new friends,\r\nand nothing about my old ones.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where are you lunching, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“At Aunt Agatha’s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He is her\r\nlatest <i>protégé</i>.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her\r\ncharity appeals. I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that I have\r\nnothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, Uncle George, I’ll tell her, but it won’t have\r\nany effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity. It is their\r\ndistinguishing characteristic.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his servant. Lord\r\nHenry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his steps in\r\nthe direction of Berkeley Square.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had been\r\ntold to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost\r\nmodern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few\r\nwild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of\r\nvoiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by\r\ndeath, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.\r\nYes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect,\r\nas it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something\r\ntragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... And\r\nhow charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and\r\nlips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the\r\nred candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face.\r\nTalking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every\r\ntouch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the\r\nexercise of influence. No other activity was like it. To project one’s\r\nsoul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear\r\none’s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music\r\nof passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though\r\nit were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in\r\nthat—perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and\r\nvulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common\r\nin its aims.... He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a\r\nchance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be fashioned into a\r\nmarvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood,\r\nand beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing that one\r\ncould not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was\r\nthat such beauty was destined to fade! ... And Basil? From a psychological\r\npoint of view, how interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of\r\nlooking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one\r\nwho was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland,\r\nand walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not\r\nafraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that\r\nwonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes\r\nand patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of\r\nsymbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and\r\nmore perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He\r\nremembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in\r\nthought, who had first analyzed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in\r\nthe coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was\r\nstrange.... Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it,\r\nthe lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would\r\nseek to dominate him—had already, indeed, half done so. He would make\r\nthat wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of\r\nlove and death.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses. He found that he had passed\r\nhis aunt’s some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back. When he\r\nentered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him that they had gone in to\r\nlunch. He gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Late as usual, Harry,” cried his aunt, shaking her head at him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to her,\r\nlooked round to see who was there. Dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of\r\nthe table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek. Opposite was the\r\nDuchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked\r\nby every one who knew her, and of those ample architectural proportions that in\r\nwomen who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as\r\nstoutness. Next to her sat, on her right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member\r\nof Parliament, who followed his leader in public life and in private life\r\nfollowed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals,\r\nin accordance with a wise and well-known rule. The post on her left was\r\noccupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and\r\nculture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he\r\nexplained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he had to say before he was\r\nthirty. His own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his aunt’s oldest\r\nfriends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she\r\nreminded one of a badly bound hymn-book. Fortunately for him she had on the\r\nother side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a\r\nministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom she was conversing in\r\nthat intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he\r\nremarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which\r\nnone of them ever quite escape.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,” cried the\r\nduchess, nodding pleasantly to him across the table. “Do you think he\r\nwill really marry this fascinating young person?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him, Duchess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How dreadful!” exclaimed Lady Agatha. “Really, some one\r\nshould interfere.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am told, on excellent authority, that her father keeps an American\r\ndry-goods store,” said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods?” asked the duchess,\r\nraising her large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“American novels,” answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some\r\nquail.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe duchess looked puzzled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t mind him, my dear,” whispered Lady Agatha. “He\r\nnever means anything that he says.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When America was discovered,” said the Radical member—and he\r\nbegan to give some wearisome facts. Like all people who try to exhaust a\r\nsubject, he exhausted his listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised her\r\nprivilege of interruption. “I wish to goodness it never had been\r\ndiscovered at all!” she exclaimed. “Really, our girls have no\r\nchance nowadays. It is most unfair.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,” said Mr.\r\nErskine; “I myself would say that it had merely been detected.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,” answered the\r\nduchess vaguely. “I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty.\r\nAnd they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris. I wish I could\r\nafford to do the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,” chuckled\r\nSir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour’s cast-off clothes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die?” inquired\r\nthe duchess.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They go to America,” murmured Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSir Thomas frowned. “I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against\r\nthat great country,” he said to Lady Agatha. “I have travelled all\r\nover it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely\r\ncivil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?” asked Mr.\r\nErskine plaintively. “I don’t feel up to the journey.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSir Thomas waved his hand. “Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his\r\nshelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them. The\r\nAmericans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable.\r\nI think that is their distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an\r\nabsolutely reasonable people. I assure you there is no nonsense about the\r\nAmericans.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How dreadful!” cried Lord Henry. “I can stand brute force,\r\nbut brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about its use.\r\nIt is hitting below the intellect.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do not understand you,” said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I do, Lord Henry,” murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Paradoxes are all very well in their way....” rejoined the\r\nbaronet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was that a paradox?” asked Mr. Erskine. “I did not think so.\r\nPerhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth. To test reality\r\nwe must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we can\r\njudge them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear me!” said Lady Agatha, “how you men argue! I am sure I\r\nnever can make out what you are talking about. Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with\r\nyou. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East\r\nEnd? I assure you he would be quite invaluable. They would love his\r\nplaying.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want him to play to me,” cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he\r\nlooked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,” continued Lady Agatha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can sympathize with everything except suffering,” said Lord\r\nHenry, shrugging his shoulders. “I cannot sympathize with that. It is too\r\nugly, too horrible, too distressing. There is something terribly morbid in the\r\nmodern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty,\r\nthe joy of life. The less said about life’s sores, the better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Still, the East End is a very important problem,” remarked Sir\r\nThomas with a grave shake of the head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Quite so,” answered the young lord. “It is the problem of\r\nslavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe politician looked at him keenly. “What change do you propose,\r\nthen?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry laughed. “I don’t desire to change anything in England\r\nexcept the weather,” he answered. “I am quite content with\r\nphilosophic contemplation. But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt\r\nthrough an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal\r\nto science to put us straight. The advantage of the emotions is that they lead\r\nus astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But we have such grave responsibilities,” ventured Mrs. Vandeleur\r\ntimidly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Terribly grave,” echoed Lady Agatha.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. “Humanity takes itself too\r\nseriously. It is the world’s original sin. If the caveman had known how\r\nto laugh, history would have been different.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are really very comforting,” warbled the duchess. “I\r\nhave always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no\r\ninterest at all in the East End. For the future I shall be able to look her in\r\nthe face without a blush.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A blush is very becoming, Duchess,” remarked Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Only when one is young,” she answered. “When an old woman\r\nlike myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would\r\ntell me how to become young again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe thought for a moment. “Can you remember any great error that you\r\ncommitted in your early days, Duchess?” he asked, looking at her across\r\nthe table.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A great many, I fear,” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then commit them over again,” he said gravely. “To get back\r\none’s youth, one has merely to repeat one’s follies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A delightful theory!” she exclaimed. “I must put it into\r\npractice.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A dangerous theory!” came from Sir Thomas’s tight lips. Lady\r\nAgatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” he continued, “that is one of the great secrets of\r\nlife. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover\r\nwhen it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one’s\r\nmistakes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA laugh ran round the table.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed\r\nit; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged\r\nit with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy,\r\nand philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure,\r\nwearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like\r\na Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being\r\nsober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod\r\nthe huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose\r\nround her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over\r\nthe vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary\r\nimprovisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the\r\nconsciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he\r\nwished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his\r\nimagination. He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his\r\nlisteners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe, laughing. Dorian Gray\r\nnever took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing\r\neach other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the\r\nshape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting. She wrung\r\nher hands in mock despair. “How annoying!” she cried. “I must\r\ngo. I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him to some absurd\r\nmeeting at Willis’s Rooms, where he is going to be in the chair. If I am\r\nlate he is sure to be furious, and I couldn’t have a scene in this\r\nbonnet. It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear\r\nAgatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully\r\ndemoralizing. I am sure I don’t know what to say about your views. You\r\nmust come and dine with us some night. Tuesday? Are you disengaged\r\nTuesday?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,” said Lord Henry with\r\na bow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,” she cried;\r\n“so mind you come”; and she swept out of the room, followed by Lady\r\nAgatha and the other ladies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair\r\nclose to him, placed his hand upon his arm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You talk books away,” he said; “why don’t you write\r\none?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine. I\r\nshould like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a\r\nPersian carpet and as unreal. But there is no literary public in England for\r\nanything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the\r\nworld the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I fear you are right,” answered Mr. Erskine. “I myself used\r\nto have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago. And now, my dear young\r\nfriend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all\r\nthat you said to us at lunch?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I quite forget what I said,” smiled Lord Henry. “Was it all\r\nvery bad?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very bad indeed. In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if\r\nanything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being\r\nprimarily responsible. But I should like to talk to you about life. The\r\ngeneration into which I was born was tedious. Some day, when you are tired of\r\nLondon, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure\r\nover some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall be charmed. A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege. It\r\nhas a perfect host, and a perfect library.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will complete it,” answered the old gentleman with a courteous\r\nbow. “And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at the\r\nAthenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All of you, Mr. Erskine?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English\r\nAcademy of Letters.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry laughed and rose. “I am going to the park,” he cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him on the arm.\r\n“Let me come with you,” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him,”\r\nanswered Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let\r\nme. And you will promise to talk to me all the time? No one talks so\r\nwonderfully as you do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,” said Lord Henry,\r\nsmiling. “All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it\r\nwith me, if you care to.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap04\"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nOne afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious\r\narm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry’s house in Mayfair. It\r\nwas, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of\r\nolive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork,\r\nand its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk, long-fringed Persian rugs. On a\r\ntiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of\r\nLes Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered\r\nwith the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her device. Some large blue\r\nchina jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the\r\nsmall leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a\r\nsummer day in London.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry had not yet come in. He was always late on principle, his principle\r\nbeing that punctuality is the thief of time. So the lad was looking rather\r\nsulky, as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately\r\nillustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he had found in one of the\r\nbook-cases. The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed\r\nhim. Once or twice he thought of going away.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last he heard a step outside, and the door opened. “How late you are,\r\nHarry!” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,” answered a shrill voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe glanced quickly round and rose to his feet. “I beg your pardon. I\r\nthought—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You thought it was my husband. It is only his wife. You must let me\r\nintroduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband\r\nhas got seventeen of them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not seventeen, Lady Henry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him the other night at the\r\nopera.” She laughed nervously as she spoke, and watched him with her\r\nvague forget-me-not eyes. She was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked\r\nas if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest. She was usually\r\nin love with somebody, and, as her passion was never returned, she had kept all\r\nher illusions. She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being\r\nuntidy. Her name was Victoria, and she had a perfect mania for going to church.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner’s music better than\r\nanybody’s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other\r\npeople hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don’t you think\r\nso, Mr. Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe same nervous staccato laugh broke from her thin lips, and her fingers began\r\nto play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian smiled and shook his head: “I am afraid I don’t think so,\r\nLady Henry. I never talk during music—at least, during good music. If one\r\nhears bad music, it is one’s duty to drown it in conversation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! that is one of Harry’s views, isn’t it, Mr. Gray? I\r\nalways hear Harry’s views from his friends. It is the only way I get to\r\nknow of them. But you must not think I don’t like good music. I adore it,\r\nbut I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped\r\npianists—two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me. I don’t know\r\nwhat it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are,\r\nain’t they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a\r\ntime, don’t they? It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art.\r\nMakes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn’t it? You have never been to any of my\r\nparties, have you, Mr. Gray? You must come. I can’t afford orchids, but I\r\nspare no expense in foreigners. They make one’s rooms look so\r\npicturesque. But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you\r\nsomething—I forget what it was—and I found Mr. Gray here. We have\r\nhad such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I think\r\nour ideas are quite different. But he has been most pleasant. I am so glad\r\nI’ve seen him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,” said Lord Henry, elevating\r\nhis dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused\r\nsmile. “So sorry I am late, Dorian. I went to look after a piece of old\r\nbrocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people\r\nknow the price of everything and the value of nothing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am afraid I must be going,” exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an\r\nawkward silence with her silly sudden laugh. “I have promised to drive\r\nwith the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining out, I\r\nsuppose? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury’s.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I dare say, my dear,” said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind\r\nher as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the\r\nrain, she flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni. Then\r\nhe lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,” he said\r\nafter a few puffs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because they are so sentimental.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I like sentimental people.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women,\r\nbecause they are curious: both are disappointed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love.\r\nThat is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into practice, as I do\r\neverything that you say.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who are you in love with?” asked Lord Henry after a pause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“With an actress,” said Dorian Gray, blushing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “That is a rather commonplace\r\n<i>début</i>.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You would not say so if you saw her, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who is she?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Her name is Sibyl Vane.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never heard of her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No one has. People will some day, however. She is a genius.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They\r\nnever have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the\r\ntriumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over\r\nmorals.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, how can you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so I\r\nought to know. The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I find that,\r\nultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured. The\r\nplain women are very useful. If you want to gain a reputation for\r\nrespectability, you have merely to take them down to supper. The other women\r\nare very charming. They commit one mistake, however. They paint in order to try\r\nand look young. Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.\r\n<i>Rouge</i> and <i>esprit</i> used to go together. That is all over now. As\r\nlong as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter, she is\r\nperfectly satisfied. As for conversation, there are only five women in London\r\nworth talking to, and two of these can’t be admitted into decent society.\r\nHowever, tell me about your genius. How long have you known her?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never mind that. How long have you known her?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“About three weeks.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And where did you come across her?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn’t be unsympathetic about it.\r\nAfter all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You filled me\r\nwith a wild desire to know everything about life. For days after I met you,\r\nsomething seemed to throb in my veins. As I lounged in the park, or strolled\r\ndown Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder, with a\r\nmad curiosity, what sort of lives they led. Some of them fascinated me. Others\r\nfilled me with terror. There was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a\r\npassion for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven o’clock, I\r\ndetermined to go out in search of some adventure. I felt that this grey\r\nmonstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and\r\nits splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.\r\nI fancied a thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. I\r\nremembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first\r\ndined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret of life. I\r\ndon’t know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon\r\nlosing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares.\r\nAbout half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre, with great flaring\r\ngas-jets and gaudy play-bills. A hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I\r\never beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar. He\r\nhad greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled\r\nshirt. ‘Have a box, my Lord?’ he said, when he saw me, and he took\r\noff his hat with an air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him,\r\nHarry, that amused me. He was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but\r\nI really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box. To the present day\r\nI can’t make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn’t—my dear\r\nHarry, if I hadn’t—I should have missed the greatest romance of my\r\nlife. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you. But you\r\nshould not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first\r\nromance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love\r\nwith love. A <i>grande passion</i> is the privilege of people who have nothing\r\nto do. That is the one use of the idle classes of a country. Don’t be\r\nafraid. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the\r\nbeginning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you think my nature so shallow?” cried Dorian Gray angrily.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No; I think your nature so deep.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the\r\nshallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either\r\nthe lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the\r\nemotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect—simply a\r\nconfession of failure. Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion\r\nfor property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we\r\nwere not afraid that others might pick them up. But I don’t want to\r\ninterrupt you. Go on with your story.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a\r\nvulgar drop-scene staring me in the face. I looked out from behind the curtain\r\nand surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias,\r\nlike a third-rate wedding-cake. The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the\r\ntwo rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in\r\nwhat I suppose they called the dress-circle. Women went about with oranges and\r\nginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what\r\non earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill. What do you think\r\nthe play was, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should think ‘The Idiot Boy’, or ‘Dumb but\r\nInnocent’. Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe. The\r\nlonger I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for\r\nour fathers is not good enough for us. In art, as in politics, <i>les\r\ngrandpères ont toujours tort</i>.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This play was good enough for us, Harry. It was Romeo and Juliet. I must\r\nadmit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such\r\na wretched hole of a place. Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any\r\nrate, I determined to wait for the first act. There was a dreadful orchestra,\r\npresided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove\r\nme away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began. Romeo was\r\na stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a\r\nfigure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad. He was played by the\r\nlow-comedian, who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms\r\nwith the pit. They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if\r\nit had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet! Harry, imagine a girl, hardly\r\nseventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with\r\nplaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips\r\nthat were like the petals of a rose. She was the loveliest thing I had ever\r\nseen in my life. You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that\r\nbeauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears. I tell you, Harry, I\r\ncould hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me. And her\r\nvoice—I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep\r\nmellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one’s ear. Then it became a\r\nlittle louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy. In the\r\ngarden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn\r\nwhen nightingales are singing. There were moments, later on, when it had the\r\nwild passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one. Your voice and the\r\nvoice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my\r\neyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different. I don’t\r\nknow which to follow. Why should I not love her? Harry, I do love her. She is\r\neverything to me in life. Night after night I go to see her play. One evening\r\nshe is Rosalind, and the next evening she is Imogen. I have seen her die in the\r\ngloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her lover’s lips. I\r\nhave watched her wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty\r\nboy in hose and doublet and dainty cap. She has been mad, and has come into the\r\npresence of a guilty king, and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste\r\nof. She has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her\r\nreedlike throat. I have seen her in every age and in every costume. Ordinary\r\nwomen never appeal to one’s imagination. They are limited to their\r\ncentury. No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as\r\none knows their bonnets. One can always find them. There is no mystery in any\r\nof them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the\r\nafternoon. They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They\r\nare quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is! Harry! why\r\ndidn’t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an\r\nextraordinary charm in them, sometimes,” said Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life you\r\nwill tell me everything you do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things.\r\nYou have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and\r\nconfess it to you. You would understand me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“People like you—the wilful sunbeams of life—don’t\r\ncommit crimes, Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.\r\nAnd now tell me—reach me the matches, like a good\r\nboy—thanks—what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.\r\n“Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,”\r\nsaid Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. “But why\r\nshould you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When one is\r\nin love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one always ends\r\nby deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance. You know her, at\r\nany rate, I suppose?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course I know her. On the first night I was at the theatre, the\r\nhorrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered\r\nto take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her. I was furious with him,\r\nand told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body\r\nwas lying in a marble tomb in Verona. I think, from his blank look of\r\namazement, that he was under the impression that I had taken too much\r\nchampagne, or something.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am not surprised.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers. I told him I\r\nnever even read them. He seemed terribly disappointed at that, and confided to\r\nme that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him, and that\r\nthey were every one of them to be bought.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should not wonder if he was quite right there. But, on the other hand,\r\njudging from their appearance, most of them cannot be at all expensive.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, he seemed to think they were beyond his means,” laughed\r\nDorian. “By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the\r\ntheatre, and I had to go. He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly\r\nrecommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the place\r\nagain. When he saw me, he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a\r\nmunificent patron of art. He was a most offensive brute, though he had an\r\nextraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He told me once, with an air of pride,\r\nthat his five bankruptcies were entirely due to ‘The Bard,’ as he\r\ninsisted on calling him. He seemed to think it a distinction.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was a distinction, my dear Dorian—a great distinction. Most\r\npeople become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of\r\nlife. To have ruined one’s self over poetry is an honour. But when did\r\nyou first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The third night. She had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going\r\nround. I had thrown her some flowers, and she had looked at me—at least I\r\nfancied that she had. The old Jew was persistent. He seemed determined to take\r\nme behind, so I consented. It was curious my not wanting to know her,\r\nwasn’t it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No; I don’t think so.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Harry, why?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the\r\ngirl.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Sibyl? Oh, she was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child\r\nabout her. Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I\r\nthought of her performance, and she seemed quite unconscious of her power. I\r\nthink we were both rather nervous. The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of\r\nthe dusty greenroom, making elaborate speeches about us both, while we stood\r\nlooking at each other like children. He would insist on calling me ‘My\r\nLord,’ so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind. She\r\nsaid quite simply to me, ‘You look more like a prince. I must call you\r\nPrince Charming.’”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t understand her, Harry. She regarded me merely as a\r\nperson in a play. She knows nothing of life. She lives with her mother, a faded\r\ntired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on\r\nthe first night, and looks as if she had seen better days.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know that look. It depresses me,” murmured Lord Henry, examining\r\nhis rings.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The Jew wanted to tell me her history, but I said it did not interest\r\nme.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You were quite right. There is always something infinitely mean about\r\nother people’s tragedies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Sibyl is the only thing I care about. What is it to me where she came\r\nfrom? From her little head to her little feet, she is absolutely and entirely\r\ndivine. Every night of my life I go to see her act, and every night she is more\r\nmarvellous.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is the reason, I suppose, that you never dine with me now. I\r\nthought you must have some curious romance on hand. You have; but it is not\r\nquite what I expected.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Harry, we either lunch or sup together every day, and I have\r\nbeen to the opera with you several times,” said Dorian, opening his blue\r\neyes in wonder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You always come dreadfully late.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I can’t help going to see Sibyl play,” he cried,\r\n“even if it is only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and\r\nwhen I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory\r\nbody, I am filled with awe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You can dine with me to-night, Dorian, can’t you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe shook his head. “To-night she is Imogen,” he answered,\r\n“and to-morrow night she will be Juliet.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“When is she Sibyl Vane?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I congratulate you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How horrid you are! She is all the great heroines of the world in one.\r\nShe is more than an individual. You laugh, but I tell you she has genius. I\r\nlove her, and I must make her love me. You, who know all the secrets of life,\r\ntell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me! I want to make Romeo jealous. I\r\nwant the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a\r\nbreath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their\r\nashes into pain. My God, Harry, how I worship her!” He was walking up and\r\ndown the room as he spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. He was\r\nterribly excited.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different he was\r\nnow from the shy frightened boy he had met in Basil Hallward’s studio!\r\nHis nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame.\r\nOut of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet\r\nit on the way.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And what do you propose to do?” said Lord Henry at last.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act. I have\r\nnot the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to acknowledge her\r\ngenius. Then we must get her out of the Jew’s hands. She is bound to him\r\nfor three years—at least for two years and eight months—from the\r\npresent time. I shall have to pay him something, of course. When all that is\r\nsettled, I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly. She will\r\nmake the world as mad as she has made me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That would be impossible, my dear boy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, she will. She has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in her,\r\nbut she has personality also; and you have often told me that it is\r\npersonalities, not principles, that move the age.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, what night shall we go?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let me see. To-day is Tuesday. Let us fix to-morrow. She plays Juliet\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right. The Bristol at eight o’clock; and I will get\r\nBasil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not eight, Harry, please. Half-past six. We must be there before the\r\ncurtain rises. You must see her in the first act, where she meets Romeo.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Half-past six! What an hour! It will be like having a meat-tea, or\r\nreading an English novel. It must be seven. No gentleman dines before seven.\r\nShall you see Basil between this and then? Or shall I write to him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Basil! I have not laid eyes on him for a week. It is rather horrid\r\nof me, as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame, specially\r\ndesigned by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of the picture for being\r\na whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I delight in it. Perhaps you\r\nhad better write to him. I don’t want to see him alone. He says things\r\nthat annoy me. He gives me good advice.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry smiled. “People are very fond of giving away what they need\r\nmost themselves. It is what I call the depth of generosity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he seems to me to be just a bit of\r\na Philistine. Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him into his\r\nwork. The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices,\r\nhis principles, and his common sense. The only artists I have ever known who\r\nare personally delightful are bad artists. Good artists exist simply in what\r\nthey make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A\r\ngreat poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures. But\r\ninferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more\r\npicturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate\r\nsonnets makes a man quite irresistible. He lives the poetry that he cannot\r\nwrite. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wonder is that really so, Harry?” said Dorian Gray, putting some\r\nperfume on his handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on\r\nthe table. “It must be, if you say it. And now I am off. Imogen is\r\nwaiting for me. Don’t forget about to-morrow. Good-bye.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to\r\nthink. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and\r\nyet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest\r\npang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more\r\ninteresting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural\r\nscience, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him\r\ntrivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had\r\nended by vivisecting others. Human life—that appeared to him the one\r\nthing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value.\r\nIt was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and\r\npleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep\r\nthe sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid\r\nwith monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that\r\nto know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so\r\nstrange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their\r\nnature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole\r\nworld became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the\r\nemotional coloured life of the intellect—to observe where they met, and\r\nwhere they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they\r\nwere at discord—there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost\r\nwas? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was conscious—and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his\r\nbrown agate eyes—that it was through certain words of his, musical words\r\nsaid with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this\r\nwhite girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent the lad was his\r\nown creation. He had made him premature. That was something. Ordinary people\r\nwaited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect,\r\nthe mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes\r\nthis was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt\r\nimmediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex\r\npersonality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its\r\nway, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry\r\nhas, or sculpture, or painting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was yet\r\nspring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming\r\nself-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and\r\nhis beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all\r\nended, or was destined to end. He was like one of those gracious figures in a\r\npageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows\r\nstir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSoul and body, body and soul—how mysterious they were! There was\r\nanimalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses\r\ncould refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly\r\nimpulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary\r\ndefinitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between\r\nthe claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of\r\nsin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The\r\nseparation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with\r\nmatter was a mystery also.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science\r\nthat each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it was, we always\r\nmisunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. Experience was of no\r\nethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists\r\nhad, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain\r\nethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something\r\nthat taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no\r\nmotive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience\r\nitself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same\r\nas our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do\r\nmany times, and with joy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which\r\none could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly\r\nDorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and\r\nfruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological\r\nphenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to\r\ndo with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences, yet it was not a\r\nsimple, but rather a very complex passion. What there was in it of the purely\r\nsensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the\r\nimagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote\r\nfrom sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the\r\npassions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly\r\nover us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. It\r\noften happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were\r\nreally experimenting on ourselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and\r\nhis valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner. He got up\r\nand looked out into the street. The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the\r\nupper windows of the houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated\r\nmetal. The sky above was like a faded rose. He thought of his friend’s\r\nyoung fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he arrived home, about half-past twelve o’clock, he saw a telegram\r\nlying on the hall table. He opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray. It was\r\nto tell him that he was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap05\"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mother, Mother, I am so happy!” whispered the girl, burying her\r\nface in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the\r\nshrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy\r\nsitting-room contained. “I am so happy!” she repeated, “and\r\nyou must be happy, too!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Vane winced and put her thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her\r\ndaughter’s head. “Happy!” she echoed, “I am only happy,\r\nSibyl, when I see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting. Mr.\r\nIsaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him money.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl looked up and pouted. “Money, Mother?” she cried,\r\n“what does money matter? Love is more than money.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get\r\na proper outfit for James. You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty pounds is a\r\nvery large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he talks to me,”\r\nsaid the girl, rising to her feet and going over to the window.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know how we could manage without him,” answered the\r\nelder woman querulously.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSibyl Vane tossed her head and laughed. “We don’t want him any\r\nmore, Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now.” Then she paused. A\r\nrose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks. Quick breath parted the petals\r\nof her lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept over her and\r\nstirred the dainty folds of her dress. “I love him,” she said\r\nsimply.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Foolish child! foolish child!” was the parrot-phrase flung in\r\nanswer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the\r\nwords.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her eyes\r\ncaught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a moment, as\r\nthough to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed\r\nacross them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted\r\nfrom that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense. She did\r\nnot listen. She was free in her prison of passion. Her prince, Prince Charming,\r\nwas with her. She had called on memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to\r\nsearch for him, and it had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her\r\nmouth. Her eyelids were warm with his breath.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This young\r\nman might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of\r\nher ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her.\r\nShe saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly she felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her.\r\n“Mother, Mother,” she cried, “why does he love me so much? I\r\nknow why I love him. I love him because he is like what love himself should be.\r\nBut what does he see in me? I am not worthy of him. And yet—why, I cannot\r\ntell—though I feel so much beneath him, I don’t feel humble. I feel\r\nproud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince\r\nCharming?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks, and\r\nher dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain. Sybil rushed to her, flung her arms\r\nround her neck, and kissed her. “Forgive me, Mother. I know it pains you\r\nto talk about our father. But it only pains you because you loved him so much.\r\nDon’t look so sad. I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah!\r\nlet me be happy for ever!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides,\r\nwhat do you know of this young man? You don’t even know his name. The\r\nwhole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to\r\nAustralia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you should have\r\nshown more consideration. However, as I said before, if he is rich ...”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMrs. Vane glanced at her, and with one of those false theatrical gestures that\r\nso often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her in her\r\narms. At this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair\r\ncame into the room. He was thick-set of figure, and his hands and feet were\r\nlarge and somewhat clumsy in movement. He was not so finely bred as his sister.\r\nOne would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.\r\nMrs. Vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile. She mentally\r\nelevated her son to the dignity of an audience. She felt sure that the\r\n<i>tableau</i> was interesting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,” said\r\nthe lad with a good-natured grumble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! but you don’t like being kissed, Jim,” she cried.\r\n“You are a dreadful old bear.” And she ran across the room and\r\nhugged him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJames Vane looked into his sister’s face with tenderness. “I want\r\nyou to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl. I don’t suppose I shall ever\r\nsee this horrid London again. I am sure I don’t want to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My son, don’t say such dreadful things,” murmured Mrs. Vane,\r\ntaking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.\r\nShe felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group. It would have\r\nincreased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why not, Mother? I mean it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You pain me, my son. I trust you will return from Australia in a\r\nposition of affluence. I believe there is no society of any kind in the\r\nColonies—nothing that I would call society—so when you have made\r\nyour fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Society!” muttered the lad. “I don’t want to know\r\nanything about that. I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off\r\nthe stage. I hate it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Jim!” said Sibyl, laughing, “how unkind of you! But are\r\nyou really going for a walk with me? That will be nice! I was afraid you were\r\ngoing to say good-bye to some of your friends—to Tom Hardy, who gave you\r\nthat hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking it. It is\r\nvery sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon. Where shall we go? Let us\r\ngo to the park.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am too shabby,” he answered, frowning. “Only swell people\r\ngo to the park.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nonsense, Jim,” she whispered, stroking the sleeve of his coat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe hesitated for a moment. “Very well,” he said at last, “but\r\ndon’t be too long dressing.” She danced out of the door. One could\r\nhear her singing as she ran upstairs. Her little feet pattered overhead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he turned to the still\r\nfigure in the chair. “Mother, are my things ready?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Quite ready, James,” she answered, keeping her eyes on her work.\r\nFor some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this\r\nrough stern son of hers. Her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes\r\nmet. She used to wonder if he suspected anything. The silence, for he made no\r\nother observation, became intolerable to her. She began to complain. Women\r\ndefend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange\r\nsurrenders. “I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring\r\nlife,” she said. “You must remember that it is your own choice. You\r\nmight have entered a solicitor’s office. Solicitors are a very\r\nrespectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hate offices, and I hate clerks,” he replied. “But you are\r\nquite right. I have chosen my own life. All I say is, watch over Sibyl.\r\nDon’t let her come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“James, you really talk very strangely. Of course I watch over\r\nSibyl.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to\r\ntalk to her. Is that right? What about that?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are speaking about things you don’t understand, James. In the\r\nprofession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying\r\nattention. I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was when\r\nacting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether\r\nher attachment is serious or not. But there is no doubt that the young man in\r\nquestion is a perfect gentleman. He is always most polite to me. Besides, he\r\nhas the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he sends are lovely.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t know his name, though,” said the lad harshly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” answered his mother with a placid expression in her face.\r\n“He has not yet revealed his real name. I think it is quite romantic of\r\nhim. He is probably a member of the aristocracy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJames Vane bit his lip. “Watch over Sibyl, Mother,” he cried,\r\n“watch over her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special\r\ncare. Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she\r\nshould not contract an alliance with him. I trust he is one of the aristocracy.\r\nHe has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a most brilliant\r\nmarriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple. His good looks are\r\nreally quite remarkable; everybody notices them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his\r\ncoarse fingers. He had just turned round to say something when the door opened\r\nand Sibyl ran in.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How serious you both are!” she cried. “What is the\r\nmatter?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nothing,” he answered. “I suppose one must be serious\r\nsometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o’clock.\r\nEverything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good-bye, my son,” she answered with a bow of strained\r\nstateliness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe was extremely annoyed at the tone he had adopted with her, and there was\r\nsomething in his look that had made her feel afraid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Kiss me, Mother,” said the girl. Her flowerlike lips touched the\r\nwithered cheek and warmed its frost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My child! my child!” cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in\r\nsearch of an imaginary gallery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, Sibyl,” said her brother impatiently. He hated his\r\nmother’s affectations.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the\r\ndreary Euston Road. The passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth\r\nwho, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful,\r\nrefined-looking girl. He was like a common gardener walking with a rose.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some\r\nstranger. He had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late\r\nin life and never leaves the commonplace. Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious\r\nof the effect she was producing. Her love was trembling in laughter on her\r\nlips. She was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she might think of him all\r\nthe more, she did not talk of him, but prattled on about the ship in which Jim\r\nwas going to sail, about the gold he was certain to find, about the wonderful\r\nheiress whose life he was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers. For\r\nhe was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he was going to be.\r\nOh, no! A sailor’s existence was dreadful. Fancy being cooped up in a\r\nhorrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black\r\nwind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!\r\nHe was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain,\r\nand go off at once to the gold-fields. Before a week was over he was to come\r\nacross a large nugget of pure gold, the largest nugget that had ever been\r\ndiscovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted\r\npolicemen. The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated\r\nwith immense slaughter. Or, no. He was not to go to the gold-fields at all.\r\nThey were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in\r\nbar-rooms, and used bad language. He was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one\r\nevening, as he was riding home, he was to see the beautiful heiress being\r\ncarried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her. Of\r\ncourse, she would fall in love with him, and he with her, and they would get\r\nmarried, and come home, and live in an immense house in London. Yes, there were\r\ndelightful things in store for him. But he must be very good, and not lose his\r\ntemper, or spend his money foolishly. She was only a year older than he was,\r\nbut she knew so much more of life. He must be sure, also, to write to her by\r\nevery mail, and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep. God was\r\nvery good, and would watch over him. She would pray for him, too, and in a few\r\nyears he would come back quite rich and happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad listened sulkily to her and made no answer. He was heart-sick at\r\nleaving home.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose. Inexperienced though\r\nhe was, he had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl’s position.\r\nThis young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good. He was a\r\ngentleman, and he hated him for that, hated him through some curious\r\nrace-instinct for which he could not account, and which for that reason was all\r\nthe more dominant within him. He was conscious also of the shallowness and\r\nvanity of his mother’s nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl\r\nand Sibyl’s happiness. Children begin by loving their parents; as they\r\ngrow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis mother! He had something on his mind to ask of her, something that he had\r\nbrooded on for many months of silence. A chance phrase that he had heard at the\r\ntheatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at\r\nthe stage-door, had set loose a train of horrible thoughts. He remembered it as\r\nif it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his face. His brows knit\r\ntogether into a wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he bit his\r\nunderlip.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,” cried Sibyl,\r\n“and I am making the most delightful plans for your future. Do say\r\nsomething.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do you want me to say?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,” she answered,\r\nsmiling at him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “You are more likely to forget me than I am to\r\nforget you, Sibyl.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe flushed. “What do you mean, Jim?” she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he? Why have you not told me about\r\nhim? He means you no good.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stop, Jim!” she exclaimed. “You must not say anything\r\nagainst him. I love him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, you don’t even know his name,” answered the lad.\r\n“Who is he? I have a right to know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is called Prince Charming. Don’t you like the name. Oh! you\r\nsilly boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him, you would think him\r\nthe most wonderful person in the world. Some day you will meet him—when\r\nyou come back from Australia. You will like him so much. Everybody likes him,\r\nand I ... love him. I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He is going\r\nto be there, and I am to play Juliet. Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to\r\nbe in love and play Juliet! To have him sitting there! To play for his delight!\r\nI am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in\r\nlove is to surpass one’s self. Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting\r\n‘genius’ to his loafers at the bar. He has preached me as a dogma;\r\nto-night he will announce me as a revelation. I feel it. And it is all his, his\r\nonly, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor\r\nbeside him. Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the door,\r\nlove flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting. They were made\r\nin winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of\r\nblossoms in blue skies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is a gentleman,” said the lad sullenly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A prince!” she cried musically. “What more do you\r\nwant?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He wants to enslave you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shudder at the thought of being free.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want you to beware of him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Sibyl, you are mad about him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe laughed and took his arm. “You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were\r\na hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. Then you will know what it\r\nis. Don’t look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to think that, though\r\nyou are going away, you leave me happier than I have ever been before. Life has\r\nbeen hard for us both, terribly hard and difficult. But it will be different\r\nnow. You are going to a new world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs;\r\nlet us sit down and see the smart people go by.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across the\r\nroad flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white dust—tremulous cloud of\r\norris-root it seemed—hung in the panting air. The brightly coloured\r\nparasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He spoke slowly\r\nand with effort. They passed words to each other as players at a game pass\r\ncounters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not communicate her joy. A faint\r\nsmile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win. After some time\r\nshe became silent. Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing\r\nlips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe started to her feet. “There he is!” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who?” said Jim Vane.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Prince Charming,” she answered, looking after the victoria.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. “Show him to me. Which is\r\nhe? Point him out. I must see him!” he exclaimed; but at that moment the\r\nDuke of Berwick’s four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the\r\nspace clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is gone,” murmured Sibyl sadly. “I wish you had seen\r\nhim.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does\r\nyou any wrong, I shall kill him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air like a\r\ndagger. The people round began to gape. A lady standing close to her tittered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come away, Jim; come away,” she whispered. He followed her\r\ndoggedly as she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what he had said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity in her\r\neyes that became laughter on her lips. She shook her head at him. “You\r\nare foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you\r\nsay such horrible things? You don’t know what you are talking about. You\r\nare simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you would fall in love. Love makes\r\npeople good, and what you said was wicked.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am sixteen,” he answered, “and I know what I am about.\r\nMother is no help to you. She doesn’t understand how to look after you. I\r\nwish now that I was not going to Australia at all. I have a great mind to chuck\r\nthe whole thing up. I would, if my articles hadn’t been signed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, don’t be so serious, Jim. You are like one of the heroes of\r\nthose silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in. I am not going\r\nto quarrel with you. I have seen him, and oh! to see him is perfect happiness.\r\nWe won’t quarrel. I know you would never harm any one I love, would\r\nyou?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not as long as you love him, I suppose,” was the sullen answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall love him for ever!” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And he?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For ever, too!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He had better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe shrank from him. Then she laughed and put her hand on his arm. He was\r\nmerely a boy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their\r\nshabby home in the Euston Road. It was after five o’clock, and Sibyl had\r\nto lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted that she should\r\ndo so. He said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not\r\npresent. She would be sure to make a scene, and he detested scenes of every\r\nkind.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Sybil’s own room they parted. There was jealousy in the lad’s\r\nheart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him,\r\nhad come between them. Yet, when her arms were flung round his neck, and her\r\nfingers strayed through his hair, he softened and kissed her with real\r\naffection. There were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis mother was waiting for him below. She grumbled at his unpunctuality, as he\r\nentered. He made no answer, but sat down to his meagre meal. The flies buzzed\r\nround the table and crawled over the stained cloth. Through the rumble of\r\nomnibuses, and the clatter of street-cabs, he could hear the droning voice\r\ndevouring each minute that was left to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some time, he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands. He\r\nfelt that he had a right to know. It should have been told to him before, if it\r\nwas as he suspected. Leaden with fear, his mother watched him. Words dropped\r\nmechanically from her lips. A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her\r\nfingers. When the clock struck six, he got up and went to the door. Then he\r\nturned back and looked at her. Their eyes met. In hers he saw a wild appeal for\r\nmercy. It enraged him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mother, I have something to ask you,” he said. Her eyes wandered\r\nvaguely about the room. She made no answer. “Tell me the truth. I have a\r\nright to know. Were you married to my father?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe heaved a deep sigh. It was a sigh of relief. The terrible moment, the\r\nmoment that night and day, for weeks and months, she had dreaded, had come at\r\nlast, and yet she felt no terror. Indeed, in some measure it was a\r\ndisappointment to her. The vulgar directness of the question called for a\r\ndirect answer. The situation had not been gradually led up to. It was crude. It\r\nreminded her of a bad rehearsal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” she answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My father was a scoundrel then!” cried the lad, clenching his\r\nfists.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe shook her head. “I knew he was not free. We loved each other very\r\nmuch. If he had lived, he would have made provision for us. Don’t speak\r\nagainst him, my son. He was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he was highly\r\nconnected.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn oath broke from his lips. “I don’t care for myself,” he\r\nexclaimed, “but don’t let Sibyl.... It is a gentleman, isn’t\r\nit, who is in love with her, or says he is? Highly connected, too, I\r\nsuppose.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her head\r\ndrooped. She wiped her eyes with shaking hands. “Sibyl has a\r\nmother,” she murmured; “I had none.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad was touched. He went towards her, and stooping down, he kissed her.\r\n“I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,” he\r\nsaid, “but I could not help it. I must go now. Good-bye. Don’t\r\nforget that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me that\r\nif this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he is, track him down, and\r\nkill him like a dog. I swear it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied\r\nit, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her. She was\r\nfamiliar with the atmosphere. She breathed more freely, and for the first time\r\nfor many months she really admired her son. She would have liked to have\r\ncontinued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he cut her short. Trunks\r\nhad to be carried down and mufflers looked for. The lodging-house drudge\r\nbustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman. The moment was\r\nlost in vulgar details. It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that\r\nshe waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her son drove\r\naway. She was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She consoled\r\nherself by telling Sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be, now that she\r\nhad only one child to look after. She remembered the phrase. It had pleased\r\nher. Of the threat she said nothing. It was vividly and dramatically expressed.\r\nShe felt that they would all laugh at it some day.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap06\"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?” said Lord Henry that\r\nevening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where\r\ndinner had been laid for three.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, Harry,” answered the artist, giving his hat and coat to the\r\nbowing waiter. “What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They\r\ndon’t interest me. There is hardly a single person in the House of\r\nCommons worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little\r\nwhitewashing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,” said Lord Henry, watching\r\nhim as he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward started and then frowned. “Dorian engaged to be married!”\r\nhe cried. “Impossible!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is perfectly true.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To whom?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To some little actress or other.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then, my dear\r\nBasil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Except in America,” rejoined Lord Henry languidly. “But I\r\ndidn’t say he was married. I said he was engaged to be married. There is\r\na great difference. I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have\r\nno recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I never\r\nwas engaged.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But think of Dorian’s birth, and position, and wealth. It would be\r\nabsurd for him to marry so much beneath him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you want to make him marry this girl, tell him that, Basil. He is\r\nsure to do it, then. Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is\r\nalways from the noblest motives.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope the girl is good, Harry. I don’t want to see Dorian tied to\r\nsome vile creature, who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, she is better than good—she is beautiful,” murmured Lord\r\nHenry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. “Dorian says she\r\nis beautiful, and he is not often wrong about things of that kind. Your\r\nportrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of\r\nother people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst others. We are to see\r\nher to-night, if that boy doesn’t forget his appointment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you serious?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever\r\nbe more serious than I am at the present moment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But do you approve of it, Harry?” asked the painter, walking up\r\nand down the room and biting his lip. “You can’t approve of it,\r\npossibly. It is some silly infatuation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd\r\nattitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral\r\nprejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never\r\ninterfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me,\r\nwhatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful\r\nto me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and\r\nproposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina, he would be none the\r\nless interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback\r\nto marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are\r\ncolourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that\r\nmarriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many\r\nother egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly\r\norganized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of\r\nman’s existence. Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one\r\nmay say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian\r\nGray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and\r\nthen suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a wonderful\r\nstudy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you\r\ndon’t. If Dorian Gray’s life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier\r\nthan yourself. You are much better than you pretend to be.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry laughed. “The reason we all like to think so well of others is\r\nthat we are all afraid for ourselves. The basis of optimism is sheer terror. We\r\nthink that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession\r\nof those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us. We praise the banker\r\nthat we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in\r\nthe hope that he may spare our pockets. I mean everything that I have said. I\r\nhave the greatest contempt for optimism. As for a spoiled life, no life is\r\nspoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have\r\nmerely to reform it. As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there\r\nare other and more interesting bonds between men and women. I will certainly\r\nencourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is Dorian\r\nhimself. He will tell you more than I can.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!” said\r\nthe lad, throwing off his evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking\r\neach of his friends by the hand in turn. “I have never been so happy. Of\r\ncourse, it is sudden—all really delightful things are. And yet it seems\r\nto me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life.” He was\r\nflushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,” said Hallward,\r\n“but I don’t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your\r\nengagement. You let Harry know.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And I don’t forgive you for being late for dinner,” broke in\r\nLord Henry, putting his hand on the lad’s shoulder and smiling as he\r\nspoke. “Come, let us sit down and try what the new <i>chef</i> here is\r\nlike, and then you will tell us how it all came about.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is really not much to tell,” cried Dorian as they took their\r\nseats at the small round table. “What happened was simply this. After I\r\nleft you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little\r\nItalian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at\r\neight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course, the\r\nscenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen\r\nher! When she came on in her boy’s clothes, she was perfectly wonderful.\r\nShe wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown,\r\ncross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk’s feather\r\ncaught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed\r\nto me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine\r\nthat you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like\r\ndark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting—well, you shall see her\r\nto-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely\r\nenthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was\r\naway with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance\r\nwas over, I went behind and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly\r\nthere came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before. My lips\r\nmoved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can’t describe to you what I\r\nfelt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one\r\nperfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over and shook like a\r\nwhite narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I\r\nfeel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of course,\r\nour engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I\r\ndon’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious.\r\nI don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do\r\nwhat I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take my love out of\r\npoetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips that Shakespeare\r\ntaught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of\r\nRosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,” said Hallward slowly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Have you seen her to-day?” asked Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray shook his head. “I left her in the forest of Arden; I shall\r\nfind her in an orchard in Verona.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry sipped his champagne in a meditative manner. “At what\r\nparticular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what did she\r\nsay in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did\r\nnot make any formal proposal. I told her that I loved her, and she said she was\r\nnot worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is nothing to me\r\ncompared with her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Women are wonderfully practical,” murmured Lord Henry, “much\r\nmore practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to say\r\nanything about marriage, and they always remind us.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward laid his hand upon his arm. “Don’t, Harry. You have\r\nannoyed Dorian. He is not like other men. He would never bring misery upon any\r\none. His nature is too fine for that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry looked across the table. “Dorian is never annoyed with\r\nme,” he answered. “I asked the question for the best reason\r\npossible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any\r\nquestion—simple curiosity. I have a theory that it is always the women\r\nwho propose to us, and not we who propose to the women. Except, of course, in\r\nmiddle-class life. But then the middle classes are not modern.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray laughed, and tossed his head. “You are quite incorrigible,\r\nHarry; but I don’t mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. When you\r\nsee Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a\r\nbeast, a beast without a heart. I cannot understand how any one can wish to\r\nshame the thing he loves. I love Sibyl Vane. I want to place her on a pedestal\r\nof gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine. What is marriage?\r\nAn irrevocable vow. You mock at it for that. Ah! don’t mock. It is an\r\nirrevocable vow that I want to take. Her trust makes me faithful, her belief\r\nmakes me good. When I am with her, I regret all that you have taught me. I\r\nbecome different from what you have known me to be. I am changed, and the mere\r\ntouch of Sibyl Vane’s hand makes me forget you and all your wrong,\r\nfascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And those are ...?” asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some\r\nsalad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories\r\nabout pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,” he\r\nanswered in his slow melodious voice. “But I am afraid I cannot claim my\r\ntheory as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature’s\r\ntest, her sign of approval. When we are happy, we are always good, but when we\r\nare good, we are not always happy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! but what do you mean by good?” cried Basil Hallward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” echoed Dorian, leaning back in his chair and looking at Lord\r\nHenry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the centre\r\nof the table, “what do you mean by good, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied,\r\ntouching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers.\r\n“Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own\r\nlife—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s\r\nneighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s\r\nmoral views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides,\r\nindividualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting\r\nthe standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of culture to\r\naccept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But, surely, if one lives merely for one’s self, Harry, one pays a\r\nterrible price for doing so?” suggested the painter.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays. I should fancy that the\r\nreal tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial.\r\nBeautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One has to pay in other ways but money.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What sort of ways, Basil?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ... well, in the\r\nconsciousness of degradation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, mediæval art is\r\ncharming, but mediæval emotions are out of date. One can use them in fiction,\r\nof course. But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things\r\nthat one has ceased to use in fact. Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a\r\npleasure, and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know what pleasure is,” cried Dorian Gray. “It is to adore\r\nsome one.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is certainly better than being adored,” he answered, toying\r\nwith some fruits. “Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as\r\nhumanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us to do\r\nsomething for them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to\r\nus,” murmured the lad gravely. “They create love in our natures.\r\nThey have a right to demand it back.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is quite true, Dorian,” cried Hallward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Nothing is ever quite true,” said Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This is,” interrupted Dorian. “You must admit, Harry, that\r\nwomen give to men the very gold of their lives.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Possibly,” he sighed, “but they invariably want it back in\r\nsuch very small change. That is the worry. Women, as some witty Frenchman once\r\nput it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us\r\nfrom carrying them out.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, you are dreadful! I don’t know why I like you so\r\nmuch.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will always like me, Dorian,” he replied. “Will you have\r\nsome coffee, you fellows? Waiter, bring coffee, and <i>fine-champagne</i>, and\r\nsome cigarettes. No, don’t mind the cigarettes—I have some. Basil,\r\nI can’t allow you to smoke cigars. You must have a cigarette. A cigarette\r\nis the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one\r\nunsatisfied. What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of\r\nme. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to\r\ncommit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What nonsense you talk, Harry!” cried the lad, taking a light from\r\na fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.\r\n“Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will\r\nhave a new ideal of life. She will represent something to you that you have\r\nnever known.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have known everything,” said Lord Henry, with a tired look in\r\nhis eyes, “but I am always ready for a new emotion. I am afraid, however,\r\nthat, for me at any rate, there is no such thing. Still, your wonderful girl\r\nmay thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life. Let us go.\r\nDorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for\r\ntwo in the brougham. You must follow us in a hansom.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The painter\r\nwas silent and preoccupied. There was a gloom over him. He could not bear this\r\nmarriage, and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that\r\nmight have happened. After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. He drove\r\noff by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the\r\nlittle brougham in front of him. A strange sense of loss came over him. He felt\r\nthat Dorian Gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past.\r\nLife had come between them.... His eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring\r\nstreets became blurred to his eyes. When the cab drew up at the theatre, it\r\nseemed to him that he had grown years older.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap07\"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFor some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew\r\nmanager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily\r\ntremulous smile. He escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility,\r\nwaving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice. Dorian Gray\r\nloathed him more than ever. He felt as if he had come to look for Miranda and\r\nhad been met by Caliban. Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him. At\r\nleast he declared he did, and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring\r\nhim that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone\r\nbankrupt over a poet. Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the\r\npit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a\r\nmonstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire. The youths in the gallery had\r\ntaken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked\r\nto each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls\r\nwho sat beside them. Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were\r\nhorribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the\r\nbar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What a place to find one’s divinity in!” said Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes!” answered Dorian Gray. “It was here I found her, and\r\nshe is divine beyond all living things. When she acts, you will forget\r\neverything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal\r\ngestures, become quite different when she is on the stage. They sit silently\r\nand watch her. They weep and laugh as she wills them to do. She makes them as\r\nresponsive as a violin. She spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of\r\nthe same flesh and blood as one’s self.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The same flesh and blood as one’s self! Oh, I hope not!”\r\nexclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his\r\nopera-glass.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,” said the painter.\r\n“I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love\r\nmust be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine\r\nand noble. To spiritualize one’s age—that is something worth doing.\r\nIf this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can\r\ncreate the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if\r\nshe can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that\r\nare not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration\r\nof the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I\r\nadmit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been\r\nincomplete.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thanks, Basil,” answered Dorian Gray, pressing his hand. “I\r\nknew that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he terrifies me. But\r\nhere is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five\r\nminutes. Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going\r\nto give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause,\r\nSibyl Vane stepped on to the stage. Yes, she was certainly lovely to look\r\nat—one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he had ever\r\nseen. There was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes. A\r\nfaint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her\r\ncheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house. She stepped back a few\r\npaces and her lips seemed to tremble. Basil Hallward leaped to his feet and\r\nbegan to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at\r\nher. Lord Henry peered through his glasses, murmuring, “Charming!\r\ncharming!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe scene was the hall of Capulet’s house, and Romeo in his\r\npilgrim’s dress had entered with Mercutio and his other friends. The\r\nband, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.\r\nThrough the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a\r\ncreature from a finer world. Her body swayed, while she danced, as a plant\r\nsways in the water. The curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily.\r\nHer hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet she was curiously listless. She showed no sign of joy when her eyes rested\r\non Romeo. The few words she had to speak—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,<br>\r\n    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<br>\r\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,<br>\r\n    And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nwith the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial\r\nmanner. The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was\r\nabsolutely false. It was wrong in colour. It took away all the life from the\r\nverse. It made the passion unreal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray grew pale as he watched her. He was puzzled and anxious. Neither of\r\nhis friends dared to say anything to him. She seemed to them to be absolutely\r\nincompetent. They were horribly disappointed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the\r\nsecond act. They waited for that. If she failed there, there was nothing in\r\nher.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked charming as she came out in the moonlight. That could not be denied.\r\nBut the staginess of her acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she went on.\r\nHer gestures became absurdly artificial. She overemphasized everything that she\r\nhad to say. The beautiful passage—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\nThou knowest the mask of night is on my face,<br>\r\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>\r\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nwas declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to\r\nrecite by some second-rate professor of elocution. When she leaned over the\r\nbalcony and came to those wonderful lines—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\nAlthough I joy in thee,<br>\r\nI have no joy of this contract to-night:<br>\r\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;<br>\r\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>\r\nEre one can say, “It lightens.” Sweet, good-night!<br>\r\nThis bud of love by summer’s ripening breath<br>\r\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nshe spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her. It was not\r\nnervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she was absolutely\r\nself-contained. It was simply bad art. She was a complete failure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest\r\nin the play. They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle. The\r\nJew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and\r\nswore with rage. The only person unmoved was the girl herself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got\r\nup from his chair and put on his coat. “She is quite beautiful,\r\nDorian,” he said, “but she can’t act. Let us go.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am going to see the play through,” answered the lad, in a hard\r\nbitter voice. “I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening,\r\nHarry. I apologize to you both.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,” interrupted\r\nHallward. “We will come some other night.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish she were ill,” he rejoined. “But she seems to me to\r\nbe simply callous and cold. She has entirely altered. Last night she was a\r\ngreat artist. This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a\r\nmore wonderful thing than art.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They are both simply forms of imitation,” remarked Lord Henry.\r\n“But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not\r\ngood for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose\r\nyou will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like\r\na wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she\r\ndoes about acting, she will be a delightful experience. There are only two\r\nkinds of people who are really fascinating—people who know absolutely\r\neverything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy,\r\ndon’t look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an\r\nemotion that is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will\r\nsmoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What\r\nmore can you want?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Go away, Harry,” cried the lad. “I want to be alone. Basil,\r\nyou must go. Ah! can’t you see that my heart is breaking?” The hot\r\ntears came to his eyes. His lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box,\r\nhe leaned up against the wall, hiding his face in his hands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let us go, Basil,” said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in\r\nhis voice, and the two young men passed out together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the\r\nthird act. Dorian Gray went back to his seat. He looked pale, and proud, and\r\nindifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed interminable. Half of the audience\r\nwent out, tramping in heavy boots and laughing. The whole thing was a\r\n<i>fiasco</i>. The last act was played to almost empty benches. The curtain\r\nwent down on a titter and some groans.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the\r\ngreenroom. The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on her\r\nface. Her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire. There was a radiance about her.\r\nHer parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he entered, she looked at him, and an expression of infinite joy came over\r\nher. “How badly I acted to-night, Dorian!” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Horribly!” he answered, gazing at her in amazement.\r\n“Horribly! It was dreadful. Are you ill? You have no idea what it was.\r\nYou have no idea what I suffered.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl smiled. “Dorian,” she answered, lingering over his name\r\nwith long-drawn music in her voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the\r\nred petals of her mouth. “Dorian, you should have understood. But you\r\nunderstand now, don’t you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Understand what?” he asked, angrily.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why I was so bad to-night. Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall never\r\nact well again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “You are ill, I suppose. When you are ill you\r\nshouldn’t act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored. I was\r\nbored.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe seemed not to listen to him. She was transfigured with joy. An ecstasy of\r\nhappiness dominated her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian, Dorian,” she cried, “before I knew you, acting was\r\nthe one reality of my life. It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought\r\nthat it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other. The joy of\r\nBeatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in\r\neverything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike. The\r\npainted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them\r\nreal. You came—oh, my beautiful love!—and you freed my soul from\r\nprison. You taught me what reality really is. To-night, for the first time in\r\nmy life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty\r\npageant in which I had always played. To-night, for the first time, I became\r\nconscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight\r\nin the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had\r\nto speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say. You had\r\nbrought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.\r\nYou had made me understand what love really is. My love! My love! Prince\r\nCharming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows. You are more to me than\r\nall art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play? When I came\r\non to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from\r\nme. I thought that I was going to be wonderful. I found that I could do\r\nnothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was\r\nexquisite to me. I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of\r\nlove such as ours? Take me away, Dorian—take me away with you, where we\r\ncan be quite alone. I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not\r\nfeel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire. Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you\r\nunderstand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it would be\r\nprofanation for me to play at being in love. You have made me see that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his face. “You have\r\nkilled my love,” he muttered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked at him in wonder and laughed. He made no answer. She came across to\r\nhim, and with her little fingers stroked his hair. She knelt down and pressed\r\nhis hands to her lips. He drew them away, and a shudder ran through him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he leaped up and went to the door. “Yes,” he cried, “you\r\nhave killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don’t even\r\nstir my curiosity. You simply produce no effect. I loved you because you were\r\nmarvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the\r\ndreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art. You\r\nhave thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to\r\nlove you! What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see\r\nyou again. I will never think of you. I will never mention your name. You\r\ndon’t know what you were to me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can’t\r\nbear to think of it! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled\r\nthe romance of my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it mars\r\nyour art! Without your art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous,\r\nsplendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have\r\nborne my name. What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty\r\nface.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl grew white, and trembled. She clenched her hands together, and her\r\nvoice seemed to catch in her throat. “You are not serious, Dorian?”\r\nshe murmured. “You are acting.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,” he answered\r\nbitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe rose from her knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her face,\r\ncame across the room to him. She put her hand upon his arm and looked into his\r\neyes. He thrust her back. “Don’t touch me!” he cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA low moan broke from her, and she flung herself at his feet and lay there like\r\na trampled flower. “Dorian, Dorian, don’t leave me!” she\r\nwhispered. “I am so sorry I didn’t act well. I was thinking of you\r\nall the time. But I will try—indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly\r\nacross me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had not\r\nkissed me—if we had not kissed each other. Kiss me again, my love.\r\nDon’t go away from me. I couldn’t bear it. Oh! don’t go away\r\nfrom me. My brother ... No; never mind. He didn’t mean it. He was in\r\njest.... But you, oh! can’t you forgive me for to-night? I will work so\r\nhard and try to improve. Don’t be cruel to me, because I love you better\r\nthan anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not pleased\r\nyou. But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an\r\nartist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn’t help it. Oh, don’t\r\nleave me, don’t leave me.” A fit of passionate sobbing choked her.\r\nShe crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his\r\nbeautiful eyes, looked down at her, and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite\r\ndisdain. There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom\r\none has ceased to love. Sibyl Vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic.\r\nHer tears and sobs annoyed him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am going,” he said at last in his calm clear voice. “I\r\ndon’t wish to be unkind, but I can’t see you again. You have\r\ndisappointed me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer. Her little hands\r\nstretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him. He turned on his\r\nheel and left the room. In a few moments he was out of the theatre.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhere he went to he hardly knew. He remembered wandering through dimly lit\r\nstreets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women\r\nwith hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had\r\nreeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had\r\nseen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths\r\nfrom gloomy courts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the dawn was just breaking, he found himself close to Covent Garden. The\r\ndarkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a\r\nperfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the\r\npolished empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and\r\ntheir beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the\r\nmarket and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter\r\noffered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept\r\nany money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at\r\nmidnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long line of\r\nboys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in\r\nfront of him, threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of\r\nvegetables. Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars, loitered a\r\ntroop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. Others\r\ncrowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza. The heavy\r\ncart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and\r\ntrappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.\r\nIris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a little while, he hailed a hansom and drove home. For a few moments he\r\nloitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent square, with its blank,\r\nclose-shuttered windows and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and\r\nthe roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney\r\nopposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through\r\nthe nacre-coloured air.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge’s barge, that hung\r\nfrom the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still\r\nburning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed,\r\nrimmed with white fire. He turned them out and, having thrown his hat and cape\r\non the table, passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom, a\r\nlarge octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his new-born feeling for\r\nluxury, he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious\r\nRenaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at\r\nSelby Royal. As he was turning the handle of the door, his eye fell upon the\r\nportrait Basil Hallward had painted of him. He started back as if in surprise.\r\nThen he went on into his own room, looking somewhat puzzled. After he had taken\r\nthe button-hole out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. Finally, he came back,\r\nwent over to the picture, and examined it. In the dim arrested light that\r\nstruggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to\r\nbe a little changed. The expression looked different. One would have said that\r\nthere was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The bright dawn\r\nflooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they\r\nlay shuddering. But the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of\r\nthe portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even. The quivering\r\nardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as\r\nif he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids,\r\none of Lord Henry’s many presents to him, glanced hurriedly into its\r\npolished depths. No line like that warped his red lips. What did it mean?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe rubbed his eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again. There\r\nwere no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting, and yet\r\nthere was no doubt that the whole expression had altered. It was not a mere\r\nfancy of his own. The thing was horribly apparent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe threw himself into a chair and began to think. Suddenly there flashed across\r\nhis mind what he had said in Basil Hallward’s studio the day the picture\r\nhad been finished. Yes, he remembered it perfectly. He had uttered a mad wish\r\nthat he himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his own\r\nbeauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his\r\npassions and his sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of\r\nsuffering and thought, and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and\r\nloveliness of his then just conscious boyhood. Surely his wish had not been\r\nfulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of\r\nthem. And, yet, there was the picture before him, with the touch of cruelty in\r\nthe mouth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCruelty! Had he been cruel? It was the girl’s fault, not his. He had\r\ndreamed of her as a great artist, had given his love to her because he had\r\nthought her great. Then she had disappointed him. She had been shallow and\r\nunworthy. And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him, as he thought\r\nof her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child. He remembered with what\r\ncallousness he had watched her. Why had he been made like that? Why had such a\r\nsoul been given to him? But he had suffered also. During the three terrible\r\nhours that the play had lasted, he had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon\r\nof torture. His life was well worth hers. She had marred him for a moment, if\r\nhe had wounded her for an age. Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow\r\nthan men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions.\r\nWhen they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have\r\nscenes. Lord Henry had told him that, and Lord Henry knew what women were. Why\r\nshould he trouble about Sibyl Vane? She was nothing to him now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the picture? What was he to say of that? It held the secret of his life,\r\nand told his story. It had taught him to love his own beauty. Would it teach\r\nhim to loathe his own soul? Would he ever look at it again?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The horrible\r\nnight that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen\r\nupon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad. The picture had not\r\nchanged. It was folly to think so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile.\r\nIts bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met his own. A\r\nsense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself,\r\ncame over him. It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would\r\nwither into grey. Its red and white roses would die. For every sin that he\r\ncommitted, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin.\r\nThe picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of\r\nconscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any\r\nmore—would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories\r\nthat in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion\r\nfor impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry\r\nher, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have\r\nsuffered more than he had. Poor child! He had been selfish and cruel to her.\r\nThe fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They would be\r\nhappy together. His life with her would be beautiful and pure.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the\r\nportrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. “How horrible!” he\r\nmurmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he\r\nstepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air\r\nseemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of Sibyl. A faint\r\necho of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and over again.\r\nThe birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the\r\nflowers about her.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap08\"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was long past noon when he awoke. His valet had crept several times on\r\ntiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring, and had wondered what made his\r\nyoung master sleep so late. Finally his bell sounded, and Victor came in softly\r\nwith a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china,\r\nand drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that\r\nhung in front of the three tall windows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Monsieur has well slept this morning,” he said, smiling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What o’clock is it, Victor?” asked Dorian Gray drowsily.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One hour and a quarter, Monsieur.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow late it was! He sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his\r\nletters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that\r\nmorning. He hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he opened\r\nlistlessly. They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to\r\ndinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like\r\nthat are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season.\r\nThere was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that\r\nhe had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians, who were extremely\r\nold-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when\r\nunnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several very\r\ncourteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to\r\nadvance any sum of money at a moment’s notice and at the most reasonable\r\nrates of interest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter about ten minutes he got up, and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown\r\nof silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom. The\r\ncool water refreshed him after his long sleep. He seemed to have forgotten all\r\nthat he had gone through. A dim sense of having taken part in some strange\r\ntragedy came to him once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about\r\nit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as he was dressed, he went into the library and sat down to a light\r\nFrench breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to\r\nthe open window. It was an exquisite day. The warm air seemed laden with\r\nspices. A bee flew in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with\r\nsulphur-yellow roses, stood before him. He felt perfectly happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly his eye fell on the screen that he had placed in front of the\r\nportrait, and he started.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Too cold for Monsieur?” asked his valet, putting an omelette on\r\nthe table. “I shut the window?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shook his head. “I am not cold,” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWas it all true? Had the portrait really changed? Or had it been simply his own\r\nimagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of\r\njoy? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing was absurd. It would\r\nserve as a tale to tell Basil some day. It would make him smile.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd, yet, how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing! First in the dim\r\ntwilight, and then in the bright dawn, he had seen the touch of cruelty round\r\nthe warped lips. He almost dreaded his valet leaving the room. He knew that\r\nwhen he was alone he would have to examine the portrait. He was afraid of\r\ncertainty. When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned\r\nto go, he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain. As the door was closing\r\nbehind him, he called him back. The man stood waiting for his orders. Dorian\r\nlooked at him for a moment. “I am not at home to any one, Victor,”\r\nhe said with a sigh. The man bowed and retired.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a\r\nluxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen. The screen was an old\r\none, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid\r\nLouis-Quatorze pattern. He scanned it curiously, wondering if ever before it\r\nhad concealed the secret of a man’s life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShould he move it aside, after all? Why not let it stay there? What was the use\r\nof knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was not true, why\r\ntrouble about it? But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than\r\nhis spied behind and saw the horrible change? What should he do if Basil\r\nHallward came and asked to look at his own picture? Basil would be sure to do\r\nthat. No; the thing had to be examined, and at once. Anything would be better\r\nthan this dreadful state of doubt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe got up and locked both doors. At least he would be alone when he looked upon\r\nthe mask of his shame. Then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to\r\nface. It was perfectly true. The portrait had altered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he found\r\nhimself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific\r\ninterest. That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. And\r\nyet it was a fact. Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms\r\nthat shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was\r\nwithin him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?—that\r\nwhat it dreamed, they made true? Or was there some other, more terrible reason?\r\nHe shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing\r\nat the picture in sickened horror.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne thing, however, he felt that it had done for him. It had made him conscious\r\nhow unjust, how cruel, he had been to Sibyl Vane. It was not too late to make\r\nreparation for that. She could still be his wife. His unreal and selfish love\r\nwould yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler\r\npassion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him would be a\r\nguide to him through life, would be to him what holiness is to some, and\r\nconscience to others, and the fear of God to us all. There were opiates for\r\nremorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep. But here was a visible\r\nsymbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men\r\nbrought upon their souls.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThree o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime,\r\nbut Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of\r\nlife and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine\r\nlabyrinth of passion through which he was wandering. He did not know what to\r\ndo, or what to think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate\r\nletter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself\r\nof madness. He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder\r\nwords of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves, we\r\nfeel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the\r\npriest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt\r\nthat he had been forgiven.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly there came a knock to the door, and he heard Lord Henry’s voice\r\noutside. “My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can’t\r\nbear your shutting yourself up like this.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking still\r\ncontinued and grew louder. Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to\r\nexplain to him the new life he was going to lead, to quarrel with him if it\r\nbecame necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable. He jumped up,\r\ndrew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,” said Lord Henry as he entered.\r\n“But you must not think too much about it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?” asked the lad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, of course,” answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and\r\nslowly pulling off his yellow gloves. “It is dreadful, from one point of\r\nview, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her, after\r\nthe play was over?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I was brutal, Harry—perfectly brutal. But it is all right now. I\r\nam not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself\r\nbetter.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way! I was afraid I would\r\nfind you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have got through all that,” said Dorian, shaking his head and\r\nsmiling. “I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin\r\nwith. It is not what you told me it was. It is the divinest thing in us.\r\nDon’t sneer at it, Harry, any more—at least not before me. I want\r\nto be good. I can’t bear the idea of my soul being hideous.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you on\r\nit. But how are you going to begin?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“By marrying Sibyl Vane.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Marrying Sibyl Vane!” cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at\r\nhim in perplexed amazement. “But, my dear Dorian—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about\r\nmarriage. Don’t say it. Don’t ever say things of that kind to me\r\nagain. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word\r\nto her. She is to be my wife.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn’t you get my letter? I wrote to you\r\nthis morning, and sent the note down by my own man.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was\r\nafraid there might be something in it that I wouldn’t like. You cut life\r\nto pieces with your epigrams.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You know nothing then?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray, took both\r\nhis hands in his own and held them tightly. “Dorian,” he said,\r\n“my letter—don’t be frightened—was to tell you that\r\nSibyl Vane is dead.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA cry of pain broke from the lad’s lips, and he leaped to his feet,\r\ntearing his hands away from Lord Henry’s grasp. “Dead! Sibyl dead!\r\nIt is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is quite true, Dorian,” said Lord Henry, gravely. “It is\r\nin all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one\r\ntill I came. There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be\r\nmixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris. But in London\r\npeople are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one’s <i>début</i>\r\nwith a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one’s old\r\nage. I suppose they don’t know your name at the theatre? If they\r\ndon’t, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her room? That\r\nis an important point.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian did not answer for a few moments. He was dazed with horror. Finally he\r\nstammered, in a stifled voice, “Harry, did you say an inquest? What did\r\nyou mean by that? Did Sibyl—? Oh, Harry, I can’t bear it! But be\r\nquick. Tell me everything at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in\r\nthat way to the public. It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her\r\nmother, about half-past twelve or so, she said she had forgotten something\r\nupstairs. They waited some time for her, but she did not come down again. They\r\nultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing-room. She had\r\nswallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I\r\ndon’t know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in\r\nit. I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she seems to have died\r\ninstantaneously.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, Harry, it is terrible!” cried the lad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed\r\nup in it. I see by <i>The Standard</i> that she was seventeen. I should have\r\nthought she was almost younger than that. She looked such a child, and seemed\r\nto know so little about acting. Dorian, you mustn’t let this thing get on\r\nyour nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at\r\nthe opera. It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come to my\r\nsister’s box. She has got some smart women with her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,” said Dorian Gray, half to himself,\r\n“murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife.\r\nYet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily\r\nin my garden. And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the opera,\r\nand sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards. How extraordinarily dramatic life is!\r\nIf I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it.\r\nSomehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too\r\nwonderful for tears. Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever\r\nwritten in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have\r\nbeen addressed to a dead girl. Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent\r\npeople we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she feel, or know, or listen? Oh, Harry,\r\nhow I loved her once! It seems years ago to me now. She was everything to me.\r\nThen came that dreadful night—was it really only last night?—when\r\nshe played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She explained it all to me. It\r\nwas terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a bit. I thought her shallow.\r\nSuddenly something happened that made me afraid. I can’t tell you what it\r\nwas, but it was terrible. I said I would go back to her. I felt I had done\r\nwrong. And now she is dead. My God! My God! Harry, what shall I do? You\r\ndon’t know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.\r\nShe would have done that for me. She had no right to kill herself. It was\r\nselfish of her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his\r\ncase and producing a gold-latten matchbox, “the only way a woman can ever\r\nreform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest\r\nin life. If you had married this girl, you would have been wretched. Of course,\r\nyou would have treated her kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom\r\none cares nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely\r\nindifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she\r\neither becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other\r\nwoman’s husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake,\r\nwhich would have been abject—which, of course, I would not have\r\nallowed—but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been\r\nan absolute failure.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I suppose it would,” muttered the lad, walking up and down the\r\nroom and looking horribly pale. “But I thought it was my duty. It is not\r\nmy fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right. I\r\nremember your saying once that there is a fatality about good\r\nresolutions—that they are always made too late. Mine certainly\r\nwere.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws.\r\nTheir origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely <i>nil</i>. They give\r\nus, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain\r\ncharm for the weak. That is all that can be said for them. They are simply\r\ncheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry,” cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside\r\nhim, “why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to? I\r\ndon’t think I am heartless. Do you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be\r\nentitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,” answered Lord Henry with\r\nhis sweet melancholy smile.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad frowned. “I don’t like that explanation, Harry,” he\r\nrejoined, “but I am glad you don’t think I am heartless. I am\r\nnothing of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that\r\nhas happened does not affect me as it should. It seems to me to be simply like\r\na wonderful ending to a wonderful play. It has all the terrible beauty of a\r\nGreek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but by which I have not\r\nbeen wounded.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is an interesting question,” said Lord Henry, who found an\r\nexquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism, “an\r\nextremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is this: It\r\noften happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic\r\nmanner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence,\r\ntheir absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just\r\nas vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and\r\nwe revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic\r\nelements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the\r\nwhole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find\r\nthat we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we\r\nare both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls\r\nus. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has\r\nkilled herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an experience.\r\nIt would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who\r\nhave adored me—there have not been very many, but there have been\r\nsome—have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care\r\nfor them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when\r\nI meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman!\r\nWhat a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it\r\nreveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember\r\nits details. Details are always vulgar.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I must sow poppies in my garden,” sighed Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is no necessity,” rejoined his companion. “Life has\r\nalways poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore\r\nnothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for\r\na romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what\r\nkilled it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me.\r\nThat is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity.\r\nWell—would you believe it?—a week ago, at Lady Hampshire’s, I\r\nfound myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on\r\ngoing over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the\r\nfuture. I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. She dragged it out again\r\nand assured me that I had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an\r\nenormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she\r\nshowed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know\r\nwhen the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the\r\ninterest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it. If they\r\nwere allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every\r\ntragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they\r\nhave no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian,\r\nthat not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane\r\ndid for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by\r\ngoing in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever\r\nher age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It\r\nalways means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in\r\nsuddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their\r\nconjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it were the most fascinating of\r\nsins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation,\r\na woman once told me, and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one\r\nso vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us\r\nall. Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern\r\nlife. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is that, Harry?” said the lad listlessly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when\r\none loses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But\r\nreally, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one\r\nmeets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death. I am glad I am\r\nliving in a century when such wonders happen. They make one believe in the\r\nreality of the things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and\r\nlove.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than\r\nanything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated\r\nthem, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love\r\nbeing dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you really and\r\nabsolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all,\r\nyou said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time\r\nto be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the\r\nkey to everything.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What was that, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of\r\nromance—that she was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if\r\nshe died as Juliet, she came to life as Imogen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She will never come to life again now,” muttered the lad, burying\r\nhis face in his hands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, she will never come to life. She has played her last part. But you\r\nmust think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange\r\nlurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster,\r\nor Ford, or Cyril Tourneur. The girl never really lived, and so she has never\r\nreally died. To you at least she was always a dream, a phantom that flitted\r\nthrough Shakespeare’s plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a\r\nreed through which Shakespeare’s music sounded richer and more full of\r\njoy. The moment she touched actual life, she marred it, and it marred her, and\r\nso she passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like. Put ashes on your head\r\nbecause Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of\r\nBrabantio died. But don’t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane. She was less\r\nreal than they are.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with\r\nsilver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden. The colours faded wearily\r\nout of things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some time Dorian Gray looked up. “You have explained me to myself,\r\nHarry,” he murmured with something of a sigh of relief. “I felt all\r\nthat you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it\r\nto myself. How well you know me! But we will not talk again of what has\r\nhappened. It has been a marvellous experience. That is all. I wonder if life\r\nhas still in store for me anything as marvellous.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Life has everything in store for you, Dorian. There is nothing that you,\r\nwith your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled? What\r\nthen?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, then,” said Lord Henry, rising to go, “then, my dear\r\nDorian, you would have to fight for your victories. As it is, they are brought\r\nto you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too\r\nmuch to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful. We cannot spare you.\r\nAnd now you had better dress and drive down to the club. We are rather late, as\r\nit is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat\r\nanything. What is the number of your sister’s box?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her name\r\non the door. But I am sorry you won’t come and dine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t feel up to it,” said Dorian listlessly. “But I\r\nam awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me. You are certainly\r\nmy best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,” answered\r\nLord Henry, shaking him by the hand. “Good-bye. I shall see you before\r\nnine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he closed the door behind him, Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in a few\r\nminutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down. He waited\r\nimpatiently for him to go. The man seemed to take an interminable time over\r\neverything.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as he had left, he rushed to the screen and drew it back. No; there was\r\nno further change in the picture. It had received the news of Sibyl\r\nVane’s death before he had known of it himself. It was conscious of the\r\nevents of life as they occurred. The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines\r\nof the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk\r\nthe poison, whatever it was. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it merely\r\ntake cognizance of what passed within the soul? He wondered, and hoped that\r\nsome day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes, shuddering\r\nas he hoped it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPoor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked death on the\r\nstage. Then Death himself had touched her and taken her with him. How had she\r\nplayed that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had\r\ndied for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had\r\natoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not\r\nthink any more of what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at\r\nthe theatre. When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure\r\nsent on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of love. A\r\nwonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike\r\nlook, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace. He brushed them away\r\nhastily and looked again at the picture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice\r\nalready been made? Yes, life had decided that for him—life, and his own\r\ninfinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures\r\nsubtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins—he was to have all these\r\nthings. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in\r\nstore for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he\r\nhad kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly\r\nat him. Morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its\r\nbeauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter\r\nnow with every mood to which he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and\r\nloathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the\r\nsunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its\r\nhair? The pity of it! the pity of it!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor a moment, he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed\r\nbetween him and the picture might cease. It had changed in answer to a prayer;\r\nperhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. And yet, who, that\r\nknew anything about life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young,\r\nhowever fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it\r\nmight be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been\r\nprayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious\r\nscientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence upon a\r\nliving organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and\r\ninorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things\r\nexternal to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom\r\ncalling to atom in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no\r\nimportance. He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the\r\npicture was to alter, it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely\r\ninto it?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow\r\nhis mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical\r\nof mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him\r\nhis own soul. And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where\r\nspring trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and\r\nleft behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour\r\nof boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of\r\nhis life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong,\r\nand fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured image\r\non the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling\r\nas he did so, and passed into his bedroom, where his valet was already waiting\r\nfor him. An hour later he was at the opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his\r\nchair.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap09\"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the\r\nroom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,” he said gravely. “I\r\ncalled last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew\r\nthat was impossible. But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to.\r\nI passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by\r\nanother. I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first.\r\nI read of it quite by chance in a late edition of <i>The Globe</i> that I\r\npicked up at the club. I came here at once and was miserable at not finding\r\nyou. I can’t tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know\r\nwhat you must suffer. But where were you? Did you go down and see the\r\ngirl’s mother? For a moment I thought of following you there. They gave\r\nthe address in the paper. Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn’t it? But I\r\nwas afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten. Poor woman!\r\nWhat a state she must be in! And her only child, too! What did she say about it\r\nall?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Basil, how do I know?” murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some\r\npale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and\r\nlooking dreadfully bored. “I was at the opera. You should have come on\r\nthere. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry’s sister, for the first time. We were\r\nin her box. She is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely. Don’t\r\ntalk about horrid subjects. If one doesn’t talk about a thing, it has\r\nnever happened. It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to\r\nthings. I may mention that she was not the woman’s only child. There is a\r\nson, a charming fellow, I believe. But he is not on the stage. He is a sailor,\r\nor something. And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You went to the opera?” said Hallward, speaking very slowly and\r\nwith a strained touch of pain in his voice. “You went to the opera while\r\nSibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? You can talk to me of other\r\nwomen being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved\r\nhas even the quiet of a grave to sleep in? Why, man, there are horrors in store\r\nfor that little white body of hers!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stop, Basil! I won’t hear it!” cried Dorian, leaping to his\r\nfeet. “You must not tell me about things. What is done is done. What is\r\npast is past.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You call yesterday the past?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it? It is only shallow\r\npeople who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of\r\nhimself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don’t\r\nwant to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and\r\nto dominate them.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. You look\r\nexactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my\r\nstudio to sit for his picture. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate\r\nthen. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world. Now, I\r\ndon’t know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no\r\npity in you. It is all Harry’s influence. I see that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on\r\nthe green, flickering, sun-lashed garden. “I owe a great deal to Harry,\r\nBasil,” he said at last, “more than I owe to you. You only taught\r\nme to be vain.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I am punished for that, Dorian—or shall be some day.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know what you mean, Basil,” he exclaimed, turning\r\nround. “I don’t know what you want. What do you want?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,” said the artist sadly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil,” said the lad, going over to him and putting his hand on\r\nhis shoulder, “you have come too late. Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl\r\nVane had killed herself—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that?” cried\r\nHallward, looking up at him with an expression of horror.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Basil! Surely you don’t think it was a vulgar accident? Of\r\ncourse she killed herself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe elder man buried his face in his hands. “How fearful,” he\r\nmuttered, and a shudder ran through him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No,” said Dorian Gray, “there is nothing fearful about it.\r\nIt is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act\r\nlead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or\r\nsomething tedious. You know what I mean—middle-class virtue and all that\r\nkind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was\r\nalways a heroine. The last night she played—the night you saw\r\nher—she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she\r\nknew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into\r\nthe sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has\r\nall the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was\r\nsaying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at\r\na particular moment—about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to\r\nsix—you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who\r\nbrought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered\r\nimmensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except\r\nsentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to\r\nconsole me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious.\r\nHow like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a\r\ncertain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some\r\ngrievance redressed, or some unjust law altered—I forget exactly what it\r\nwas. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had\r\nabsolutely nothing to do, almost died of <i>ennui</i>, and became a confirmed\r\nmisanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me,\r\nteach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper\r\nartistic point of view. Was it not Gautier who used to write about <i>la\r\nconsolation des arts</i>? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in\r\nyour studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like\r\nthat young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young\r\nman who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of\r\nlife. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades,\r\ngreen bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury,\r\npomp—there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament\r\nthat they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the\r\nspectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of\r\nlife. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not\r\nrealized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man\r\nnow. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must\r\nnot like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course, I\r\nam very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not\r\nstronger—you are too much afraid of life—but you are better. And\r\nhow happy we used to be together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t\r\nquarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him, and his\r\npersonality had been the great turning point in his art. He could not bear the\r\nidea of reproaching him any more. After all, his indifference was probably\r\nmerely a mood that would pass away. There was so much in him that was good, so\r\nmuch in him that was noble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, Dorian,” he said at length, with a sad smile, “I\r\nwon’t speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day. I only\r\ntrust your name won’t be mentioned in connection with it. The inquest is\r\nto take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shook his head, and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the\r\nmention of the word “inquest.” There was something so crude and\r\nvulgar about everything of the kind. “They don’t know my\r\nname,” he answered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But surely she did?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to\r\nany one. She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was,\r\nand that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming. It was pretty of\r\nher. You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. I should like to have something\r\nmore of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic\r\nwords.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you. But you\r\nmust come and sit to me yourself again. I can’t get on without\r\nyou.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can never sit to you again, Basil. It is impossible!” he\r\nexclaimed, starting back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter stared at him. “My dear boy, what nonsense!” he cried.\r\n“Do you mean to say you don’t like what I did of you? Where is it?\r\nWhy have you pulled the screen in front of it? Let me look at it. It is the\r\nbest thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply\r\ndisgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that. I felt the room looked\r\ndifferent as I came in.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don’t imagine I\r\nlet him arrange my room for me? He settles my flowers for me\r\nsometimes—that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on\r\nthe portrait.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for it.\r\nLet me see it.” And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray’s lips, and he rushed between the\r\npainter and the screen. “Basil,” he said, looking very pale,\r\n“you must not look at it. I don’t wish you to.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn’t I look\r\nat it?” exclaimed Hallward, laughing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never speak\r\nto you again as long as I live. I am quite serious. I don’t offer any\r\nexplanation, and you are not to ask for any. But, remember, if you touch this\r\nscreen, everything is over between us.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward was thunderstruck. He looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement. He\r\nhad never seen him like this before. The lad was actually pallid with rage. His\r\nhands were clenched, and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire.\r\nHe was trembling all over.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t speak!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But what is the matter? Of course I won’t look at it if you\r\ndon’t want me to,” he said, rather coldly, turning on his heel and\r\ngoing over towards the window. “But, really, it seems rather absurd that\r\nI shouldn’t see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in\r\nParis in the autumn. I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish\r\nbefore that, so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?” exclaimed Dorian Gray, a\r\nstrange sense of terror creeping over him. Was the world going to be shown his\r\nsecret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his life? That was impossible.\r\nSomething—he did not know what—had to be done at once.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes; I don’t suppose you will object to that. Georges Petit is\r\ngoing to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de\r\nSèze, which will open the first week in October. The portrait will only be away\r\na month. I should think you could easily spare it for that time. In fact, you\r\nare sure to be out of town. And if you keep it always behind a screen, you\r\ncan’t care much about it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray passed his hand over his forehead. There were beads of perspiration\r\nthere. He felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger. “You told\r\nme a month ago that you would never exhibit it,” he cried. “Why\r\nhave you changed your mind? You people who go in for being consistent have just\r\nas many moods as others have. The only difference is that your moods are rather\r\nmeaningless. You can’t have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly\r\nthat nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition. You\r\ntold Harry exactly the same thing.” He stopped suddenly, and a gleam of\r\nlight came into his eyes. He remembered that Lord Henry had said to him once,\r\nhalf seriously and half in jest, “If you want to have a strange quarter\r\nof an hour, get Basil to tell you why he won’t exhibit your picture. He\r\ntold me why he wouldn’t, and it was a revelation to me.” Yes,\r\nperhaps Basil, too, had his secret. He would ask him and try.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil,” he said, coming over quite close and looking him straight\r\nin the face, “we have each of us a secret. Let me know yours, and I shall\r\ntell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe painter shuddered in spite of himself. “Dorian, if I told you, you\r\nmight like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me. I could\r\nnot bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me never to look at\r\nyour picture again, I am content. I have always you to look at. If you wish the\r\nbest work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied. Your\r\nfriendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, Basil, you must tell me,” insisted Dorian Gray. “I think\r\nI have a right to know.” His feeling of terror had passed away, and\r\ncuriosity had taken its place. He was determined to find out Basil\r\nHallward’s mystery.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let us sit down, Dorian,” said the painter, looking troubled.\r\n“Let us sit down. And just answer me one question. Have you noticed in\r\nthe picture something curious?—something that probably at first did not\r\nstrike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Basil!” cried the lad, clutching the arms of his chair with\r\ntrembling hands and gazing at him with wild startled eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.\r\nDorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary\r\ninfluence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you. You became\r\nto me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us\r\nartists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one\r\nto whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I\r\nwas with you. When you were away from me, you were still present in my art....\r\nOf course, I never let you know anything about this. It would have been\r\nimpossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it myself. I\r\nonly knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had\r\nbecome wonderful to my eyes—too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad\r\nworships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of\r\nkeeping them.... Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in\r\nyou. Then came a new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour,\r\nand as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with\r\nheavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing\r\nacross the green turbid Nile. You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek\r\nwoodland and seen in the water’s silent silver the marvel of your own\r\nface. And it had all been what art should be—unconscious, ideal, and\r\nremote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a\r\nwonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages,\r\nbut in your own dress and in your own time. Whether it was the realism of the\r\nmethod, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to\r\nme without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it,\r\nevery flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret. I grew afraid\r\nthat others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too\r\nmuch, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was that I resolved\r\nnever to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then\r\nyou did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it,\r\nlaughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I\r\nsat alone with it, I felt that I was right.... Well, after a few days the thing\r\nleft my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of\r\nits presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had\r\nseen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I\r\ncould paint. Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that\r\nthe passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.\r\nArt is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and\r\ncolour—that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far\r\nmore completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from\r\nParis, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.\r\nIt never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right.\r\nThe picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I\r\nhave told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his cheeks, and a smile\r\nplayed about his lips. The peril was over. He was safe for the time. Yet he\r\ncould not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this\r\nstrange confession to him, and wondered if he himself would ever be so\r\ndominated by the personality of a friend. Lord Henry had the charm of being\r\nvery dangerous. But that was all. He was too clever and too cynical to be\r\nreally fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange\r\nidolatry? Was that one of the things that life had in store?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,” said Hallward, “that you\r\nshould have seen this in the portrait. Did you really see it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I saw something in it,” he answered, “something that seemed\r\nto me very curious.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, you don’t mind my looking at the thing now?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shook his head. “You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not\r\npossibly let you stand in front of that picture.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will some day, surely?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been the\r\none person in my life who has really influenced my art. Whatever I have done\r\nthat is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don’t know what it cost me to tell\r\nyou all that I have told you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Basil,” said Dorian, “what have you told me? Simply\r\nthat you felt that you admired me too much. That is not even a\r\ncompliment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I\r\nhave made it, something seems to have gone out of me. Perhaps one should never\r\nput one’s worship into words.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was a very disappointing confession.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why, what did you expect, Dorian? You didn’t see anything else in\r\nthe picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No; there was nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But you mustn’t\r\ntalk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must\r\nalways remain so.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have got Harry,” said the painter sadly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, Harry!” cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. “Harry\r\nspends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is\r\nimprobable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead. But still I don’t\r\nthink I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go to you,\r\nBasil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will sit to me again?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Impossible!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes across\r\ntwo ideal things. Few come across one.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you\r\nagain. There is something fatal about a portrait. It has a life of its own. I\r\nwill come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,” murmured Hallward regretfully.\r\n“And now good-bye. I am sorry you won’t let me look at the picture\r\nonce again. But that can’t be helped. I quite understand what you feel\r\nabout it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself. Poor Basil! How little he\r\nknew of the true reason! And how strange it was that, instead of having been\r\nforced to reveal his own secret, he had succeeded, almost by chance, in\r\nwresting a secret from his friend! How much that strange confession explained\r\nto him! The painter’s absurd fits of jealousy, his wild devotion, his\r\nextravagant panegyrics, his curious reticences—he understood them all\r\nnow, and he felt sorry. There seemed to him to be something tragic in a\r\nfriendship so coloured by romance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all costs.\r\nHe could not run such a risk of discovery again. It had been mad of him to have\r\nallowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his\r\nfriends had access.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap10\"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen his servant entered, he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had\r\nthought of peering behind the screen. The man was quite impassive and waited\r\nfor his orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced\r\ninto it. He could see the reflection of Victor’s face perfectly. It was\r\nlike a placid mask of servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there. Yet\r\nhe thought it best to be on his guard.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSpeaking very slowly, he told him to tell the house-keeper that he wanted to\r\nsee her, and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him to send two of his men\r\nround at once. It seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered\r\nin the direction of the screen. Or was that merely his own fancy?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a few moments, in her black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread mittens\r\non her wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library. He asked her for the\r\nkey of the schoolroom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?” she exclaimed. “Why, it is\r\nfull of dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It\r\nis not fit for you to see, sir. It is not, indeed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, sir, you’ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it. Why,\r\nit hasn’t been opened for nearly five years—not since his lordship\r\ndied.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe winced at the mention of his grandfather. He had hateful memories of him.\r\n“That does not matter,” he answered. “I simply want to see\r\nthe place—that is all. Give me the key.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And here is the key, sir,” said the old lady, going over the\r\ncontents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands. “Here is the key.\r\nI’ll have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don’t think of\r\nliving up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, no,” he cried petulantly. “Thank you, Leaf. That will\r\ndo.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the\r\nhousehold. He sighed and told her to manage things as she thought best. She\r\nleft the room, wreathed in smiles.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the door closed, Dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room.\r\nHis eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a\r\nsplendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his grandfather\r\nhad found in a convent near Bologna. Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful\r\nthing in. It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead. Now it was to\r\nhide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of\r\ndeath itself—something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.\r\nWhat the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the\r\ncanvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace. They would defile it\r\nand make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always\r\nalive.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe shuddered, and for a moment he regretted that he had not told Basil the true\r\nreason why he had wished to hide the picture away. Basil would have helped him\r\nto resist Lord Henry’s influence, and the still more poisonous influences\r\nthat came from his own temperament. The love that he bore him—for it was\r\nreally love—had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual. It was\r\nnot that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that\r\ndies when the senses tire. It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and\r\nMontaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself. Yes, Basil could have\r\nsaved him. But it was too late now. The past could always be annihilated.\r\nRegret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that. But the future was inevitable.\r\nThere were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that\r\nwould make the shadow of their evil real.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it,\r\nand, holding it in his hands, passed behind the screen. Was the face on the\r\ncanvas viler than before? It seemed to him that it was unchanged, and yet his\r\nloathing of it was intensified. Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red\r\nlips—they all were there. It was simply the expression that had altered.\r\nThat was horrible in its cruelty. Compared to what he saw in it of censure or\r\nrebuke, how shallow Basil’s reproaches about Sibyl Vane had\r\nbeen!—how shallow, and of what little account! His own soul was looking\r\nout at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement. A look of pain came\r\nacross him, and he flung the rich pall over the picture. As he did so, a knock\r\ncame to the door. He passed out as his servant entered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The persons are here, Monsieur.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He must not be allowed to know\r\nwhere the picture was being taken to. There was something sly about him, and he\r\nhad thoughtful, treacherous eyes. Sitting down at the writing-table he\r\nscribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him to send him round something to read\r\nand reminding him that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Wait for an answer,” he said, handing it to him, “and show\r\nthe men in here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the\r\ncelebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat\r\nrough-looking young assistant. Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little\r\nman, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate\r\nimpecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him. As a rule, he never\r\nleft his shop. He waited for people to come to him. But he always made an\r\nexception in favour of Dorian Gray. There was something about Dorian that\r\ncharmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?” he said, rubbing his fat\r\nfreckled hands. “I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round\r\nin person. I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a sale.\r\nOld Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe. Admirably suited for a religious\r\nsubject, Mr. Gray.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr.\r\nHubbard. I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame—though I\r\ndon’t go in much at present for religious art—but to-day I only\r\nwant a picture carried to the top of the house for me. It is rather heavy, so I\r\nthought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to you.\r\nWhich is the work of art, sir?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“This,” replied Dorian, moving the screen back. “Can you move\r\nit, covering and all, just as it is? I don’t want it to get scratched\r\ngoing upstairs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There will be no difficulty, sir,” said the genial frame-maker,\r\nbeginning, with the aid of his assistant, to unhook the picture from the long\r\nbrass chains by which it was suspended. “And, now, where shall we carry\r\nit to, Mr. Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me. Or\r\nperhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top of the\r\nhouse. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and began the\r\nascent. The elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely\r\nbulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard,\r\nwho had the true tradesman’s spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing\r\nanything useful, Dorian put his hand to it so as to help them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Something of a load to carry, sir,” gasped the little man when\r\nthey reached the top landing. And he wiped his shiny forehead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am afraid it is rather heavy,” murmured Dorian as he unlocked\r\nthe door that opened into the room that was to keep for him the curious secret\r\nof his life and hide his soul from the eyes of men.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe had not entered the place for more than four years—not, indeed, since\r\nhe had used it first as a play-room when he was a child, and then as a study\r\nwhen he grew somewhat older. It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had\r\nbeen specially built by the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson\r\nwhom, for his strange likeness to his mother, and also for other reasons, he\r\nhad always hated and desired to keep at a distance. It appeared to Dorian to\r\nhave but little changed. There was the huge Italian <i>cassone</i>, with its\r\nfantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he had\r\nso often hidden himself as a boy. There the satinwood book-case filled with his\r\ndog-eared schoolbooks. On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged\r\nFlemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden,\r\nwhile a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted\r\nwrists. How well he remembered it all! Every moment of his lonely childhood\r\ncame back to him as he looked round. He recalled the stainless purity of his\r\nboyish life, and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait\r\nwas to be hidden away. How little he had thought, in those dead days, of all\r\nthat was in store for him!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this.\r\nHe had the key, and no one else could enter it. Beneath its purple pall, the\r\nface painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean. What did it\r\nmatter? No one could see it. He himself would not see it. Why should he watch\r\nthe hideous corruption of his soul? He kept his youth—that was enough.\r\nAnd, besides, might not his nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason\r\nthat the future should be so full of shame. Some love might come across his\r\nlife, and purify him, and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already\r\nstirring in spirit and in flesh—those curious unpictured sins whose very\r\nmystery lent them their subtlety and their charm. Perhaps, some day, the cruel\r\nlook would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he might show\r\nto the world Basil Hallward’s masterpiece.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNo; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon the\r\ncanvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but the\r\nhideousness of age was in store for it. The cheeks would become hollow or\r\nflaccid. Yellow crow’s feet would creep round the fading eyes and make\r\nthem horrible. The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or\r\ndroop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are. There would be\r\nthe wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he\r\nremembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood. The\r\npicture had to be concealed. There was no help for it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,” he said, wearily, turning\r\nround. “I am sorry I kept you so long. I was thinking of something\r\nelse.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,” answered the frame-maker,\r\nwho was still gasping for breath. “Where shall we put it, sir?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don’t want to have it hung up.\r\nJust lean it against the wall. Thanks.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Might one look at the work of art, sir?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian started. “It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,” he said,\r\nkeeping his eye on the man. He felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the\r\nground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of\r\nhis life. “I shan’t trouble you any more now. I am much obliged for\r\nyour kindness in coming round.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray. Ever ready to do anything for you,\r\nsir.” And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant, who\r\nglanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face. He\r\nhad never seen any one so marvellous.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door and put\r\nthe key in his pocket. He felt safe now. No one would ever look upon the\r\nhorrible thing. No eye but his would ever see his shame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn reaching the library, he found that it was just after five o’clock and\r\nthat the tea had been already brought up. On a little table of dark perfumed\r\nwood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his\r\nguardian’s wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the\r\npreceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was\r\na book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled. A\r\ncopy of the third edition of <i>The St. James’s Gazette</i> had been\r\nplaced on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned. He wondered if\r\nhe had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed\r\nout of them what they had been doing. He would be sure to miss the\r\npicture—had no doubt missed it already, while he had been laying the\r\ntea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a blank space was visible on\r\nthe wall. Perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to\r\nforce the door of the room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in\r\none’s house. He had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their\r\nlives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or\r\npicked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower\r\nor a shred of crumpled lace.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry’s\r\nnote. It was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper, and a book\r\nthat might interest him, and that he would be at the club at eight-fifteen. He\r\nopened <i>The St. James’s</i> languidly, and looked through it. A red\r\npencil-mark on the fifth page caught his eye. It drew attention to the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"letter\">\r\nI<small>NQUEST ON AN</small> A<small>CTRESS</small>.—An inquest was held\r\nthis morning at the Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District\r\nCoroner, on the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the\r\nRoyal Theatre, Holborn. A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.\r\nConsiderable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was\r\ngreatly affected during the giving of her own evidence, and that of Dr.\r\nBirrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and flung the\r\npieces away. How ugly it all was! And how horribly real ugliness made things!\r\nHe felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him the report. And it\r\nwas certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil. Victor might\r\nhave read it. The man knew more than enough English for that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps he had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet, what did\r\nit matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane’s death? There was\r\nnothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him. What was it, he\r\nwondered. He went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had\r\nalways looked to him like the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought\r\nin silver, and taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began\r\nto turn over the leaves. After a few minutes he became absorbed. It was the\r\nstrangest book that he had ever read. It seemed to him that in exquisite\r\nraiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were\r\npassing in dumb show before him. Things that he had dimly dreamed of were\r\nsuddenly made real to him. Things of which he had never dreamed were gradually\r\nrevealed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being, indeed,\r\nsimply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his life\r\ntrying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of\r\nthought that belonged to every century except his own, and to sum up, as it\r\nwere, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever\r\npassed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have\r\nunwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still\r\ncall sin. The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style,\r\nvivid and obscure at once, full of <i>argot</i> and of archaisms, of technical\r\nexpressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some\r\nof the finest artists of the French school of <i>Symbolistes</i>. There were in\r\nit metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. The life of the\r\nsenses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy. One hardly knew at\r\ntimes whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediæval saint\r\nor the morbid confessions of a modern sinner. It was a poisonous book. The\r\nheavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the\r\nbrain. The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music,\r\nso full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated,\r\nproduced in the mind of the lad, as he passed from chapter to chapter, a form\r\nof reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him unconscious of the falling day\r\nand creeping shadows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed through\r\nthe windows. He read on by its wan light till he could read no more. Then,\r\nafter his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour, he\r\ngot up, and going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine\r\ntable that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was almost nine o’clock before he reached the club, where he found\r\nLord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am so sorry, Harry,” he cried, “but really it is entirely\r\nyour fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time\r\nwas going.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, I thought you would like it,” replied his host, rising from\r\nhis chair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I didn’t say I liked it, Harry. I said it fascinated me. There is\r\na great difference.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, you have discovered that?” murmured Lord Henry. And they\r\npassed into the dining-room.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap11\"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFor years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book.\r\nOr perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free\r\nhimself from it. He procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of\r\nthe first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might\r\nsuit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he\r\nseemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control. The hero, the wonderful\r\nyoung Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so\r\nstrangely blended, became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself. And,\r\nindeed, the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life,\r\nwritten before he had lived it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn one point he was more fortunate than the novel’s fantastic hero. He\r\nnever knew—never, indeed, had any cause to know—that somewhat\r\ngrotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which\r\ncame upon the young Parisian so early in his life, and was occasioned by the\r\nsudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable. It was\r\nwith an almost cruel joy—and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in\r\nevery pleasure, cruelty has its place—that he used to read the latter\r\npart of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account\r\nof the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the\r\nworld, he had most dearly valued.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others\r\nbesides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had heard the most evil\r\nthings against him—and from time to time strange rumours about his mode\r\nof life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs—could\r\nnot believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him. He had always the look\r\nof one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly\r\nbecame silent when Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the\r\npurity of his face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to\r\nthem the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one\r\nso charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that\r\nwas at once sordid and sensual.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOften, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences\r\nthat gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or\r\nthought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room,\r\nopen the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror,\r\nin front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at\r\nthe evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that\r\nlaughed back at him from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast\r\nused to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his\r\nown beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He\r\nwould examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible\r\ndelight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around\r\nthe heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the\r\nsigns of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside the\r\ncoarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the misshapen body\r\nand the failing limbs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own\r\ndelicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed\r\ntavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his\r\nhabit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with\r\na pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish. But\r\nmoments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had\r\nfirst stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend,\r\nseemed to increase with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to\r\nknow. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society. Once\r\nor twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the\r\nseason lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have\r\nthe most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders\r\nof their art. His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always\r\nassisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those\r\ninvited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with\r\nits subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths,\r\nand antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many, especially among\r\nthe very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true\r\nrealization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a\r\ntype that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all\r\nthe grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them\r\nhe seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought\r\nto “make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.” Like\r\nGautier, he was one for whom “the visible world existed.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd, certainly, to him life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts,\r\nand for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. Fashion, by which\r\nwhat is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which,\r\nin its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had,\r\nof course, their fascination for him. His mode of dressing, and the particular\r\nstyles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the\r\nyoung exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied\r\nhim in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of\r\nhis graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost\r\nimmediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle\r\npleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own\r\nday what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been,\r\nyet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere <i>arbiter\r\nelegantiarum</i>, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of\r\na necktie, or the conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of\r\nlife that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and\r\nfind in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men\r\nfeeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem\r\nstronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less\r\nhighly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the\r\ntrue nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained\r\nsavage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into\r\nsubmission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements\r\nof a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the\r\ndominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through history, he\r\nwas haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such\r\nlittle purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of\r\nself-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a\r\ndegradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which,\r\nin their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her wonderful irony,\r\ndriving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and\r\ngiving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to\r\nrecreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is\r\nhaving, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its service of the\r\nintellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that\r\nwould involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim,\r\nindeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or\r\nbitter as they might be. Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the\r\nvulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach\r\nman to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a\r\nmoment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after\r\none of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of\r\nthose nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the\r\nbrain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that\r\nvivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its\r\nenduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those\r\nwhose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white\r\nfingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black\r\nfantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch\r\nthere. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound\r\nof men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down\r\nfrom the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to\r\nwake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave.\r\nVeil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and\r\ncolours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the\r\nworld in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The\r\nflameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the\r\nhalf-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn\r\nat the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read\r\ntoo often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night\r\ncomes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had\r\nleft off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the\r\ncontinuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a\r\nwild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world\r\nthat had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in\r\nwhich things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other\r\nsecrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive,\r\nat any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even\r\nof joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be\r\nthe true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for\r\nsensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element\r\nof strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain\r\nmodes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself\r\nto their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour\r\nand satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious\r\nindifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and\r\nthat, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition\r\nof it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic\r\ncommunion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for\r\nhim. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the\r\nantique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of\r\nthe senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal\r\npathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down\r\non the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered\r\ndalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle,\r\nor raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer\r\nthat at times, one would fain think, is indeed the “<i>panis\r\ncælestis</i>,” the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the\r\nPassion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his breast\r\nfor his sins. The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and\r\nscarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle\r\nfascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black\r\nconfessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to\r\nmen and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their\r\nlives.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by\r\nany formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which\r\nto live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few\r\nhours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.\r\nMysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and\r\nthe subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a\r\nseason; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the\r\n<i>Darwinismus</i> movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing\r\nthe thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some\r\nwhite nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute\r\ndependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy,\r\nnormal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life\r\nseemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly\r\nconscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from\r\naction and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have\r\ntheir spiritual mysteries to reveal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture,\r\ndistilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw\r\nthat there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous\r\nlife, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there\r\nwas in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred\r\none’s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and\r\nin musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination;\r\nand seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate\r\nthe several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden\r\nflowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that\r\nsickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able\r\nto expel melancholy from the soul.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt another time he devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed\r\nroom, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he\r\nused to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little\r\nzithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of\r\nmonstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums\r\nand, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes\r\nof reed or brass and charmed—or feigned to charm—great hooded\r\nsnakes and horrible horned adders. The harsh intervals and shrill discords of\r\nbarbaric music stirred him at times when Schubert’s grace, and\r\nChopin’s beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven\r\nhimself, fell unheeded on his ear. He collected together from all parts of the\r\nworld the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of\r\ndead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with\r\nWestern civilizations, and loved to touch and try them. He had the mysterious\r\n<i>juruparis</i> of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look\r\nat and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting\r\nand scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries\r\nof birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile,\r\nand the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note\r\nof singular sweetness. He had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled\r\nwhen they were shaken; the long <i>clarin</i> of the Mexicans, into which the\r\nperformer does not blow, but through which he inhales the air; the harsh\r\n<i>ture</i> of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all\r\nday long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three\r\nleagues; the <i>teponaztli</i>, that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is\r\nbeaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky\r\njuice of plants; the <i>yotl</i>-bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters\r\nlike grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great\r\nserpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he went with Cortes into the\r\nMexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a\r\ndescription. The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him, and\r\nhe felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her\r\nmonsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices. Yet, after some\r\ntime, he wearied of them, and would sit in his box at the opera, either alone\r\nor with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to “Tannhauser” and\r\nseeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy\r\nof his own soul.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn one occasion he took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball\r\nas Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and\r\nsixty pearls. This taste enthralled him for years, and, indeed, may be said\r\nnever to have left him. He would often spend a whole day settling and\r\nresettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected, such as the\r\nolive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its\r\nwirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and\r\nwine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed\r\nstars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with\r\ntheir alternate layers of ruby and sapphire. He loved the red gold of the\r\nsunstone, and the moonstone’s pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of\r\nthe milky opal. He procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size\r\nand richness of colour, and had a turquoise <i>de la vieille roche</i> that was\r\nthe envy of all the connoisseurs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels. In Alphonso’s\r\nClericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in\r\nthe romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have\r\nfound in the vale of Jordan snakes “with collars of real emeralds growing\r\non their backs.” There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus\r\ntold us, and “by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet\r\nrobe” the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain.\r\nAccording to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a\r\nman invisible, and the agate of India made him eloquent. The cornelian appeased\r\nanger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes\r\nof wine. The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of\r\nher colour. The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that\r\ndiscovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids. Leonardus\r\nCamillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad,\r\nthat was a certain antidote against poison. The bezoar, that was found in the\r\nheart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. In the nests\r\nof Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the\r\nwearer from any danger by fire.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe King of Ceilan rode through his city with a large ruby in his hand, as the\r\nceremony of his coronation. The gates of the palace of John the Priest were\r\n“made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no\r\nman might bring poison within.” Over the gable were “two golden\r\napples, in which were two carbuncles,” so that the gold might shine by\r\nday and the carbuncles by night. In Lodge’s strange romance ‘A\r\nMargarite of America’, it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one\r\ncould behold “all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver,\r\nlooking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene\r\nemeraults.” Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place\r\nrose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead. A sea-monster had been\r\nenamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain\r\nthe thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss. When the Huns lured the\r\nking into the great pit, he flung it away—Procopius tells the\r\nstory—nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered\r\nfive hundred-weight of gold pieces for it. The King of Malabar had shown to a\r\ncertain Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god\r\nthat he worshipped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI., visited Louis XII. of\r\nFrance, his horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome, and his\r\ncap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light. Charles of England\r\nhad ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds. Richard\r\nII had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas\r\nrubies. Hall described Henry VIII., on his way to the Tower previous to his\r\ncoronation, as wearing “a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered\r\nwith diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his neck of\r\nlarge balasses.” The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set\r\nin gold filigrane. Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour\r\nstudded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a\r\nskull-cap <i>parsemé</i> with pearls. Henry II. wore jewelled gloves reaching\r\nto the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great\r\norients. The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his\r\nrace, was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration! Even\r\nto read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that\r\nperformed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of\r\nEurope. As he investigated the subject—and he always had an extraordinary\r\nfaculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took\r\nup—he was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought\r\non beautiful and wonderful things. He, at any rate, had escaped that. Summer\r\nfollowed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and\r\nnights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he was unchanged. No\r\nwinter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom. How different it was\r\nwith material things! Where had they passed to? Where was the great\r\ncrocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had\r\nbeen worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena? Where the huge velarium\r\nthat Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple\r\non which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by\r\nwhite, gilt-reined steeds? He longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought\r\nfor the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands\r\nthat could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with\r\nits three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation\r\nof the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with “lions, panthers, bears,\r\ndogs, forests, rocks, hunters—all, in fact, that a painter can copy from\r\nnature”; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves\r\nof which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning “<i>Madame, je\r\nsuis tout joyeux</i>,” the musical accompaniment of the words being\r\nwrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed\r\nwith four pearls. He read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims\r\nfor the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with “thirteen\r\nhundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the\r\nking’s arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were\r\nsimilarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in\r\ngold.” Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her of black\r\nvelvet powdered with crescents and suns. Its curtains were of damask, with\r\nleafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed\r\nalong the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with\r\nrows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.\r\nLouis XIV. had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment.\r\nThe state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade\r\nembroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran. Its supports were of\r\nsilver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled\r\nmedallions. It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the\r\nstandard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so, for a whole year, he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens\r\nthat he could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi\r\nmuslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with\r\niridescent beetles’ wings; the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency\r\nare known in the East as “woven air,” and “running\r\nwater,” and “evening dew”; strange figured cloths from Java;\r\nelaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue\r\nsilks and wrought with <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, birds and images; veils of\r\n<i>lacis</i> worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish\r\nvelvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese <i>Foukousas</i>,\r\nwith their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he had\r\nfor everything connected with the service of the Church. In the long cedar\r\nchests that lined the west gallery of his house, he had stored away many rare\r\nand beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ,\r\nwho must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid\r\nmacerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by\r\nself-inflicted pain. He possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and\r\ngold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set\r\nin six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple\r\ndevice wrought in seed-pearls. The orphreys were divided into panels\r\nrepresenting scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the\r\nVirgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood. This was Italian work of\r\nthe fifteenth century. Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with\r\nheart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white\r\nblossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured\r\ncrystals. The morse bore a seraph’s head in gold-thread raised work. The\r\norphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with\r\nmedallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian. He had\r\nchasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and\r\nyellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the\r\nPassion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and\r\nother emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with\r\ntulips and dolphins and <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>; altar frontals of crimson velvet\r\nand blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria. In the mystic\r\noffices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his\r\nimagination.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor these treasures, and everything that he collected in his lovely house, were\r\nto be to him means of forgetfulness, modes by which he could escape, for a\r\nseason, from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be\r\nborne. Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of\r\nhis boyhood, he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose\r\nchanging features showed him the real degradation of his life, and in front of\r\nit had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain. For weeks he would not go\r\nthere, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his light heart,\r\nhis wonderful joyousness, his passionate absorption in mere existence. Then,\r\nsuddenly, some night he would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful\r\nplaces near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he was\r\ndriven away. On his return he would sit in front of the picture, sometimes\r\nloathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of\r\nindividualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret\r\npleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have\r\nbeen his own.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a few years he could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up\r\nthe villa that he had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the\r\nlittle white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the\r\nwinter. He hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his\r\nlife, and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to\r\nthe room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon\r\nthe door.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing. It was true that the\r\nportrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its\r\nmarked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that? He would laugh\r\nat any one who tried to taunt him. He had not painted it. What was it to him\r\nhow vile and full of shame it looked? Even if he told them, would they believe\r\nit?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet he was afraid. Sometimes when he was down at his great house in\r\nNottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who\r\nwere his chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and\r\ngorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and\r\nrush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the\r\npicture was still there. What if it should be stolen? The mere thought made him\r\ncold with horror. Surely the world would know his secret then. Perhaps the\r\nworld already suspected it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him. He was\r\nvery nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his birth and social\r\nposition fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one\r\noccasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the\r\nChurchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner\r\nand went out. Curious stories became current about him after he had passed his\r\ntwenty-fifth year. It was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign\r\nsailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he consorted\r\nwith thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade. His\r\nextraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he used to reappear again in\r\nsociety, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him with a sneer,\r\nor look at him with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to\r\ndiscover his secret.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in\r\nthe opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish\r\nsmile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to\r\nleave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they\r\ntermed them, that were circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that\r\nsome of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to\r\nshun him. Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all\r\nsocial censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with\r\nshame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and\r\ndangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of security.\r\nSociety—civilized society, at least—is never very ready to believe\r\nanything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating. It feels\r\ninstinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its\r\nopinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession\r\nof a good <i>chef</i>. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told\r\nthat the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in\r\nhis private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold\r\n<i>entrées</i>, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject,\r\nand there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of\r\ngood society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is\r\nabsolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well\r\nas its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play\r\nwith the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is insincerity\r\nsuch a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can\r\nmultiply our personalities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuch, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the\r\nshallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple,\r\npermanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a being with myriad\r\nlives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within\r\nitself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was\r\ntainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the\r\ngaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various\r\nportraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins. Here was Philip Herbert,\r\ndescribed by Francis Osborne, in his Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth\r\nand King James, as one who was “caressed by the Court for his handsome\r\nface, which kept him not long company.” Was it young Herbert’s life\r\nthat he sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body\r\ntill it had reached his own? Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that\r\nhad made him so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil\r\nHallward’s studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his life? Here,\r\nin gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and\r\nwristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his silver-and-black armour piled\r\nat his feet. What had this man’s legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna\r\nof Naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame? Were his own\r\nactions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here,\r\nfrom the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her gauze hood,\r\npearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves. A flower was in her right hand, and\r\nher left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On a table by\r\nher side lay a mandolin and an apple. There were large green rosettes upon her\r\nlittle pointed shoes. He knew her life, and the strange stories that were told\r\nabout her lovers. Had he something of her temperament in him? These oval,\r\nheavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him. What of George Willoughby,\r\nwith his powdered hair and fantastic patches? How evil he looked! The face was\r\nsaturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain.\r\nDelicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen\r\nwith rings. He had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend,\r\nin his youth, of Lord Ferrars. What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion\r\nof the Prince Regent in his wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the\r\nsecret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert? How proud and handsome he was, with his\r\nchestnut curls and insolent pose! What passions had he bequeathed? The world\r\nhad looked upon him as infamous. He had led the orgies at Carlton House. The\r\nstar of the Garter glittered upon his breast. Beside him hung the portrait of\r\nhis wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black. Her blood, also, stirred within\r\nhim. How curious it all seemed! And his mother with her Lady Hamilton face and\r\nher moist, wine-dashed lips—he knew what he had got from her. He had got\r\nfrom her his beauty, and his passion for the beauty of others. She laughed at\r\nhim in her loose Bacchante dress. There were vine leaves in her hair. The\r\npurple spilled from the cup she was holding. The carnations of the painting had\r\nwithered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of\r\ncolour. They seemed to follow him wherever he went.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one’s own race, nearer\r\nperhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence\r\nof which one was more absolutely conscious. There were times when it appeared\r\nto Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life,\r\nnot as he had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his imagination had\r\ncreated it for him, as it had been in his brain and in his passions. He felt\r\nthat he had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed\r\nacross the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of\r\nsubtlety. It seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his\r\nown.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself\r\nknown this curious fancy. In the seventh chapter he tells how, crowned with\r\nlaurel, lest lightning might strike him, he had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden\r\nat Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks\r\nstrutted round him and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and,\r\nas Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and\r\nsupped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had\r\nwandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with\r\nhaggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days, and\r\nsick with that ennui, that terrible <i>tædium vitæ</i>, that comes on those\r\nto whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red\r\nshambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by\r\nsilver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House\r\nof Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he passed by; and, as Elagabalus,\r\nhad painted his face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and\r\nbrought the Moon from Carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the Sun.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOver and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two\r\nchapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or\r\ncunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those\r\nwhom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad: Filippo, Duke of\r\nMilan, who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her\r\nlover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled; Pietro Barbi, the\r\nVenetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his vanity to assume the\r\ntitle of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred thousand florins, was\r\nbought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to\r\nchase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who\r\nhad loved him; the Borgia on his white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him\r\nand his mantle stained with the blood of Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young\r\nCardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV., whose beauty\r\nwas equalled only by his debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a\r\npavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded\r\na boy that he might serve at the feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose\r\nmelancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion\r\nfor red blood, as other men have for red wine—the son of the Fiend, as\r\nwas reported, and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him\r\nfor his own soul; Giambattista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent\r\nand into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish\r\ndoctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose\r\neffigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena\r\nwith a napkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d’Este in a cup of emerald, and\r\nin honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship;\r\nCharles VI., who had so wildly adored his brother’s wife that a leper had\r\nwarned him of the insanity that was coming on him, and who, when his brain had\r\nsickened and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with\r\nthe images of love and death and madness; and, in his trimmed jerkin and\r\njewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with\r\nhis bride, and Simonetto with his page, and whose comeliness was such that, as\r\nhe lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him could not\r\nchoose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him, blessed him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a horrible fascination in them all. He saw them at night, and they\r\ntroubled his imagination in the day. The Renaissance knew of strange manners of\r\npoisoning—poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered\r\nglove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain. Dorian\r\nGray had been poisoned by a book. There were moments when he looked on evil\r\nsimply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the\r\nbeautiful.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap12\"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was on the ninth of November, the eve of his own thirty-eighth birthday, as\r\nhe often remembered afterwards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was walking home about eleven o’clock from Lord Henry’s, where\r\nhe had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold and\r\nfoggy. At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed\r\nhim in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster\r\nturned up. He had a bag in his hand. Dorian recognized him. It was Basil\r\nHallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he could not account, came over\r\nhim. He made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his\r\nown house.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut Hallward had seen him. Dorian heard him first stopping on the pavement and\r\nthen hurrying after him. In a few moments, his hand was on his arm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you\r\nin your library ever since nine o’clock. Finally I took pity on your\r\ntired servant and told him to go to bed, as he let me out. I am off to Paris by\r\nthe midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left. I\r\nthought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. But I\r\nwasn’t quite sure. Didn’t you recognize me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can’t even recognize Grosvenor\r\nSquare. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don’t feel at\r\nall certain about it. I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for\r\nages. But I suppose you will be back soon?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No: I am going to be out of England for six months. I intend to take a\r\nstudio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have\r\nin my head. However, it wasn’t about myself I wanted to talk. Here we are\r\nat your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something to say to\r\nyou.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall be charmed. But won’t you miss your train?” said\r\nDorian Gray languidly as he passed up the steps and opened the door with his\r\nlatch-key.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his watch.\r\n“I have heaps of time,” he answered. “The train doesn’t\r\ngo till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to\r\nthe club to look for you, when I met you. You see, I shan’t have any\r\ndelay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with me is\r\nin this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian looked at him and smiled. “What a way for a fashionable painter to\r\ntravel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster! Come in, or the fog will get into the\r\nhouse. And mind you don’t talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious\r\nnowadays. At least nothing should be.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward shook his head, as he entered, and followed Dorian into the library.\r\nThere was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth. The lamps were\r\nlit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of\r\nsoda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He gave me\r\neverything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes. He is a most\r\nhospitable creature. I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to\r\nhave. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shrugged his shoulders. “I believe he married Lady Radley’s\r\nmaid, and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker.\r\n<i>Anglomanie</i> is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly of\r\nthe French, doesn’t it? But—do you know?—he was not at all a\r\nbad servant. I never liked him, but I had nothing to complain about. One often\r\nimagines things that are quite absurd. He was really very devoted to me and\r\nseemed quite sorry when he went away. Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would\r\nyou like hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure\r\nto be some in the next room.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thanks, I won’t have anything more,” said the painter,\r\ntaking his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in\r\nthe corner. “And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously.\r\nDon’t frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is it all about?” cried Dorian in his petulant way, flinging\r\nhimself down on the sofa. “I hope it is not about myself. I am tired of\r\nmyself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is about yourself,” answered Hallward in his grave deep voice,\r\n“and I must say it to you. I shall only keep you half an hour.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian sighed and lit a cigarette. “Half an hour!” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own\r\nsake that I am speaking. I think it right that you should know that the most\r\ndreadful things are being said against you in London.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about\r\nother people, but scandals about myself don’t interest me. They have not\r\ngot the charm of novelty.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his\r\ngood name. You don’t want people to talk of you as something vile and\r\ndegraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind\r\nof thing. But position and wealth are not everything. Mind you, I don’t\r\nbelieve these rumours at all. At least, I can’t believe them when I see\r\nyou. Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man’s face. It cannot be\r\nconcealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices. There are no such things. If\r\na wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop\r\nof his eyelids, the moulding of his hands even. Somebody—I won’t\r\nmention his name, but you know him—came to me last year to have his\r\nportrait done. I had never seen him before, and had never heard anything about\r\nhim at the time, though I have heard a good deal since. He offered an\r\nextravagant price. I refused him. There was something in the shape of his\r\nfingers that I hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about\r\nhim. His life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent\r\nface, and your marvellous untroubled youth—I can’t believe anything\r\nagainst you. And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the\r\nstudio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things\r\nthat people are whispering about you, I don’t know what to say. Why is\r\nit, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when\r\nyou enter it? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to\r\nyour house or invite you to theirs? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I\r\nmet him at dinner last week. Your name happened to come up in conversation, in\r\nconnection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley.\r\nStaveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes,\r\nbut that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and\r\nwhom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with. I reminded him that I\r\nwas a friend of yours, and asked him what he meant. He told me. He told me\r\nright out before everybody. It was horrible! Why is your friendship so fatal to\r\nyoung men? There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide. You\r\nwere his great friend. There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England\r\nwith a tarnished name. You and he were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton\r\nand his dreadful end? What about Lord Kent’s only son and his career? I\r\nmet his father yesterday in St. James’s Street. He seemed broken with\r\nshame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth? What sort of life has he\r\ngot now? What gentleman would associate with him?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stop, Basil. You are talking about things of which you know\r\nnothing,” said Dorian Gray, biting his lip, and with a note of infinite\r\ncontempt in his voice. “You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter\r\nit. It is because I know everything about his life, not because he knows\r\nanything about mine. With such blood as he has in his veins, how could his\r\nrecord be clean? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach the\r\none his vices, and the other his debauchery? If Kent’s silly son takes\r\nhis wife from the streets, what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes his\r\nfriend’s name across a bill, am I his keeper? I know how people chatter\r\nin England. The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross\r\ndinner-tables, and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their\r\nbetters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on\r\nintimate terms with the people they slander. In this country, it is enough for\r\na man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against\r\nhim. And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead\r\nthemselves? My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the\r\nhypocrite.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian,” cried Hallward, “that is not the question. England\r\nis bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why\r\nI want you to be fine. You have not been fine. One has a right to judge of a\r\nman by the effect he has over his friends. Yours seem to lose all sense of\r\nhonour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a madness for\r\npleasure. They have gone down into the depths. You led them there. Yes: you led\r\nthem there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now. And there is worse\r\nbehind. I know you and Harry are inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for\r\nnone other, you should not have made his sister’s name a by-word.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Take care, Basil. You go too far.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady\r\nGwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her. Is there a single\r\ndecent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park? Why, even her\r\nchildren are not allowed to live with her. Then there are other\r\nstories—stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful\r\nhouses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London. Are they true?\r\nCan they be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they\r\nmake me shudder. What about your country-house and the life that is led there?\r\nDorian, you don’t know what is said about you. I won’t tell you\r\nthat I don’t want to preach to you. I remember Harry saying once that\r\nevery man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began\r\nby saying that, and then proceeded to break his word. I do want to preach to\r\nyou. I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you. I want\r\nyou to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the\r\ndreadful people you associate with. Don’t shrug your shoulders like that.\r\nDon’t be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for\r\ngood, not for evil. They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become\r\nintimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of\r\nsome kind to follow after. I don’t know whether it is so or not. How\r\nshould I know? But it is said of you. I am told things that it seems impossible\r\nto doubt. Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford. He showed\r\nme a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her\r\nvilla at Mentone. Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I\r\never read. I told him that it was absurd—that I knew you thoroughly and\r\nthat you were incapable of anything of the kind. Know you? I wonder do I know\r\nyou? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To see my soul!” muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa\r\nand turning almost white from fear.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his\r\nvoice, “to see your soul. But only God can do that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. “You\r\nshall see it yourself, to-night!” he cried, seizing a lamp from the\r\ntable. “Come: it is your own handiwork. Why shouldn’t you look at\r\nit? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would\r\nbelieve you. If they did believe you, they would like me all the better for it.\r\nI know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously.\r\nCome, I tell you. You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall\r\nlook on it face to face.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was the madness of pride in every word he uttered. He stamped his foot\r\nupon the ground in his boyish insolent manner. He felt a terrible joy at the\r\nthought that some one else was to share his secret, and that the man who had\r\npainted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened\r\nfor the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” he continued, coming closer to him and looking steadfastly\r\ninto his stern eyes, “I shall show you my soul. You shall see the thing\r\nthat you fancy only God can see.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward started back. “This is blasphemy, Dorian!” he cried.\r\n“You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they\r\ndon’t mean anything.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You think so?” He laughed again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good.\r\nYou know I have been always a stanch friend to you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t touch me. Finish what you have to say.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA twisted flash of pain shot across the painter’s face. He paused for a\r\nmoment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him. After all, what right had he\r\nto pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he had done a tithe of what was\r\nrumoured about him, how much he must have suffered! Then he straightened\r\nhimself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood there, looking at the\r\nburning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am waiting, Basil,” said the young man in a hard clear voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned round. “What I have to say is this,” he cried. “You\r\nmust give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you.\r\nIf you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I shall\r\nbelieve you. Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can’t you see what I am going\r\nthrough? My God! don’t tell me that you are bad, and corrupt, and\r\nshameful.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his lips. “Come\r\nupstairs, Basil,” he said quietly. “I keep a diary of my life from\r\nday to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written. I shall show\r\nit to you if you come with me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it. I see I have missed my\r\ntrain. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don’t ask me to read\r\nanything to-night. All I want is a plain answer to my question.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here. You will\r\nnot have to read long.”\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap13\"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nHe passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close\r\nbehind. They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night. The lamp cast\r\nfantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind made some of the\r\nwindows rattle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and\r\ntaking out the key, turned it in the lock. “You insist on knowing,\r\nBasil?” he asked in a low voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am delighted,” he answered, smiling. Then he added, somewhat\r\nharshly, “You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know\r\neverything about me. You have had more to do with my life than you\r\nthink”; and, taking up the lamp, he opened the door and went in. A cold\r\ncurrent of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of\r\nmurky orange. He shuddered. “Shut the door behind you,” he\r\nwhispered, as he placed the lamp on the table.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression. The room looked as if it\r\nhad not been lived in for years. A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture,\r\nan old Italian <i>cassone</i>, and an almost empty book-case—that was all\r\nthat it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table. As Dorian Gray was\r\nlighting a half-burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf, he saw that\r\nthe whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes. A mouse\r\nran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that\r\ncurtain back, and you will see mine.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe voice that spoke was cold and cruel. “You are mad, Dorian, or playing\r\na part,” muttered Hallward, frowning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You won’t? Then I must do it myself,” said the young man,\r\nand he tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn exclamation of horror broke from the painter’s lips as he saw in the\r\ndim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him. There was something\r\nin its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it\r\nwas Dorian Gray’s own face that he was looking at! The horror, whatever\r\nit was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty. There was still\r\nsome gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth. The\r\nsodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble\r\ncurves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from\r\nplastic throat. Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He seemed to\r\nrecognize his own brushwork, and the frame was his own design. The idea was\r\nmonstrous, yet he felt afraid. He seized the lighted candle, and held it to the\r\npicture. In the left-hand corner was his own name, traced in long letters of\r\nbright vermilion.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He had never done that.\r\nStill, it was his own picture. He knew it, and he felt as if his blood had\r\nchanged in a moment from fire to sluggish ice. His own picture! What did it\r\nmean? Why had it altered? He turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of\r\na sick man. His mouth twitched, and his parched tongue seemed unable to\r\narticulate. He passed his hand across his forehead. It was dank with clammy\r\nsweat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him with that\r\nstrange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a\r\nplay when some great artist is acting. There was neither real sorrow in it nor\r\nreal joy. There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker\r\nof triumph in his eyes. He had taken the flower out of his coat, and was\r\nsmelling it, or pretending to do so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What does this mean?” cried Hallward, at last. His own voice\r\nsounded shrill and curious in his ears.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Years ago, when I was a boy,” said Dorian Gray, crushing the\r\nflower in his hand, “you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain\r\nof my good looks. One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained\r\nto me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to\r\nme the wonder of beauty. In a mad moment that, even now, I don’t know\r\nwhether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a\r\nprayer....”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it! No! the thing is impossible.\r\nThe room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The paints I used had some\r\nwretched mineral poison in them. I tell you the thing is impossible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, what is impossible?” murmured the young man, going over to the\r\nwindow and leaning his forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You told me you had destroyed it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I was wrong. It has destroyed me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t believe it is my picture.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Can’t you see your ideal in it?” said Dorian bitterly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My ideal, as you call it...”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“As you called it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an\r\nideal as I shall never meet again. This is the face of a satyr.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is the face of my soul.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped! It has the eyes of a\r\ndevil.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Each of us has heaven and hell in him, Basil,” cried Dorian with a\r\nwild gesture of despair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. “My God! If it is\r\ntrue,” he exclaimed, “and this is what you have done with your\r\nlife, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to\r\nbe!” He held the light up again to the canvas and examined it. The\r\nsurface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it. It was from\r\nwithin, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come. Through some strange\r\nquickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing\r\naway. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHis hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there\r\nsputtering. He placed his foot on it and put it out. Then he flung himself into\r\nthe rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his\r\nhands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson!” There was\r\nno answer, but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window. “Pray,\r\nDorian, pray,” he murmured. “What is it that one was taught to say\r\nin one’s boyhood? ‘Lead us not into temptation. Forgive us our\r\nsins. Wash away our iniquities.’ Let us say that together. The prayer of\r\nyour pride has been answered. The prayer of your repentance will be answered\r\nalso. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped yourself\r\ntoo much. We are both punished.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him with tear-dimmed eyes.\r\n“It is too late, Basil,” he faltered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot\r\nremember a prayer. Isn’t there a verse somewhere, ‘Though your sins\r\nbe as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow’?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Those words mean nothing to me now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hush! Don’t say that. You have done enough evil in your life. My\r\nGod! Don’t you see that accursed thing leering at us?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of\r\nhatred for Basil Hallward came over him, as though it had been suggested to him\r\nby the image on the canvas, whispered into his ear by those grinning lips. The\r\nmad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him, and he loathed the man who\r\nwas seated at the table, more than in his whole life he had ever loathed\r\nanything. He glanced wildly around. Something glimmered on the top of the\r\npainted chest that faced him. His eye fell on it. He knew what it was. It was a\r\nknife that he had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had\r\nforgotten to take away with him. He moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward\r\nas he did so. As soon as he got behind him, he seized it and turned round.\r\nHallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise. He rushed at him and\r\ndug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the\r\nman’s head down on the table and stabbing again and again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with\r\nblood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively, waving\r\ngrotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air. He stabbed him twice more, but the\r\nman did not move. Something began to trickle on the floor. He waited for a\r\nmoment, still pressing the head down. Then he threw the knife on the table, and\r\nlistened.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet. He opened\r\nthe door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely quiet. No one\r\nwas about. For a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering\r\ndown into the black seething well of darkness. Then he took out the key and\r\nreturned to the room, locking himself in as he did so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed\r\nhead, and humped back, and long fantastic arms. Had it not been for the red\r\njagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on\r\nthe table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow quickly it had all been done! He felt strangely calm, and walking over to\r\nthe window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The wind had blown the\r\nfog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock’s tail, starred with\r\nmyriads of golden eyes. He looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds\r\nand flashing the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses.\r\nThe crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished.\r\nA woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering\r\nas she went. Now and then she stopped and peered back. Once, she began to sing\r\nin a hoarse voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her. She\r\nstumbled away, laughing. A bitter blast swept across the square. The gas-lamps\r\nflickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron\r\nbranches to and fro. He shivered and went back, closing the window behind him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving reached the door, he turned the key and opened it. He did not even\r\nglance at the murdered man. He felt that the secret of the whole thing was not\r\nto realize the situation. The friend who had painted the fatal portrait to\r\nwhich all his misery had been due had gone out of his life. That was enough.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he remembered the lamp. It was a rather curious one of Moorish\r\nworkmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel, and\r\nstudded with coarse turquoises. Perhaps it might be missed by his servant, and\r\nquestions would be asked. He hesitated for a moment, then he turned back and\r\ntook it from the table. He could not help seeing the dead thing. How still it\r\nwas! How horribly white the long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax\r\nimage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaving locked the door behind him, he crept quietly downstairs. The woodwork\r\ncreaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He stopped several times and\r\nwaited. No: everything was still. It was merely the sound of his own footsteps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he reached the library, he saw the bag and coat in the corner. They must\r\nbe hidden away somewhere. He unlocked a secret press that was in the\r\nwainscoting, a press in which he kept his own curious disguises, and put them\r\ninto it. He could easily burn them afterwards. Then he pulled out his watch. It\r\nwas twenty minutes to two.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sat down and began to think. Every year—every month, almost—men\r\nwere strangled in England for what he had done. There had been a madness of\r\nmurder in the air. Some red star had come too close to the earth.... And yet,\r\nwhat evidence was there against him? Basil Hallward had left the house at\r\neleven. No one had seen him come in again. Most of the servants were at Selby\r\nRoyal. His valet had gone to bed.... Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had\r\ngone, and by the midnight train, as he had intended. With his curious reserved\r\nhabits, it would be months before any suspicions would be roused. Months!\r\nEverything could be destroyed long before then.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA sudden thought struck him. He put on his fur coat and hat and went out into\r\nthe hall. There he paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the\r\npavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull’s-eye reflected in the\r\nwindow. He waited and held his breath.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting the door\r\nvery gently behind him. Then he began ringing the bell. In about five minutes\r\nhis valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,” he said, stepping\r\nin; “but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ten minutes past two, sir,” answered the man, looking at the clock\r\nand blinking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine\r\nto-morrow. I have some work to do.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, sir.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Did any one call this evening?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Hallward, sir. He stayed here till eleven, and then he went away to\r\ncatch his train.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! I am sorry I didn’t see him. Did he leave any message?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, sir, except that he would write to you from Paris, if he did not\r\nfind you at the club.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That will do, Francis. Don’t forget to call me at nine\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe man shambled down the passage in his slippers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library.\r\nFor a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room, biting his lip and\r\nthinking. Then he took down the Blue Book from one of the shelves and began to\r\nturn over the leaves. “Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street,\r\nMayfair.” Yes; that was the man he wanted.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap14\"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nAt nine o’clock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of\r\nchocolate on a tray and opened the shutters. Dorian was sleeping quite\r\npeacefully, lying on his right side, with one hand underneath his cheek. He\r\nlooked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke, and as he opened\r\nhis eyes a faint smile passed across his lips, as though he had been lost in\r\nsome delightful dream. Yet he had not dreamed at all. His night had been\r\nuntroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any\r\nreason. It is one of its chiefest charms.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned round, and leaning upon his elbow, began to sip his chocolate. The\r\nmellow November sun came streaming into the room. The sky was bright, and there\r\nwas a genial warmth in the air. It was almost like a morning in May.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nGradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained\r\nfeet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible\r\ndistinctness. He winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a\r\nmoment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made\r\nhim kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with\r\npassion. The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now.\r\nHow horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the\r\nday.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow\r\nmad. There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing\r\nof them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and\r\ngave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they\r\nbrought, or could ever bring, to the senses. But this was not one of them. It\r\nwas a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be\r\nstrangled lest it might strangle one itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the half-hour struck, he passed his hand across his forehead, and then got\r\nup hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care, giving a\r\ngood deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarf-pin and changing\r\nhis rings more than once. He spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the\r\nvarious dishes, talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was\r\nthinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his\r\ncorrespondence. At some of the letters, he smiled. Three of them bored him. One\r\nhe read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in\r\nhis face. “That awful thing, a woman’s memory!” as Lord Henry\r\nhad once said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter he had drunk his cup of black coffee, he wiped his lips slowly with a\r\nnapkin, motioned to his servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down\r\nand wrote two letters. One he put in his pocket, the other he handed to the\r\nvalet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is\r\nout of town, get his address.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as he was alone, he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of\r\npaper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.\r\nSuddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic\r\nlikeness to Basil Hallward. He frowned, and getting up, went over to the\r\nbook-case and took out a volume at hazard. He was determined that he would not\r\nthink about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he\r\nshould do so.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he had stretched himself on the sofa, he looked at the title-page of the\r\nbook. It was Gautier’s “Émaux et Camées”, Charpentier’s\r\nJapanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching. The binding was of\r\ncitron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted\r\npomegranates. It had been given to him by Adrian Singleton. As he turned over\r\nthe pages, his eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold\r\nyellow hand “<i>du supplice encore mal lavée</i>,” with its downy\r\nred hairs and its “<i>doigts de faune</i>.” He glanced at his own\r\nwhite taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on,\r\ntill he came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\nSur une gamme chromatique,<br>\r\n    Le sein de perles ruisselant,<br>\r\nLa Vénus de l’Adriatique<br>\r\n    Sort de l’eau son corps rose et blanc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLes dômes, sur l’azur des ondes<br>\r\n    Suivant la phrase au pur contour,<br>\r\nS’enflent comme des gorges rondes<br>\r\n    Que soulève un soupir d’amour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nL’esquif aborde et me dépose,<br>\r\n    Jetant son amarre au pilier,<br>\r\nDevant une façade rose,<br>\r\n    Sur le marbre d’un escalier.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHow exquisite they were! As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the\r\ngreen water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with\r\nsilver prow and trailing curtains. The mere lines looked to him like those\r\nstraight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.\r\nThe sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the\r\nopal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile,\r\nor stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades.\r\nLeaning back with half-closed eyes, he kept saying over and over to himself:\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n“Devant une façade rose,<br>\r\nSur le marbre d’un escalier.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nThe whole of Venice was in those two lines. He remembered the autumn that he\r\nhad passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful\r\nfollies. There was romance in every place. But Venice, like Oxford, had kept\r\nthe background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was\r\neverything, or almost everything. Basil had been with him part of the time, and\r\nhad gone wild over Tintoret. Poor Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget. He read of the\r\nswallows that fly in and out of the little <i>café</i> at Smyrna where the\r\nHadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their\r\nlong tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he read of the Obelisk in\r\nthe Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless\r\nexile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are\r\nSphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and\r\ncrocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he\r\nbegan to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble,\r\ntell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the\r\n“<i>monstre charmant</i>” that couches in the porphyry-room of the\r\nLouvre. But after a time the book fell from his hand. He grew nervous, and a\r\nhorrible fit of terror came over him. What if Alan Campbell should be out of\r\nEngland? Days would elapse before he could come back. Perhaps he might refuse\r\nto come. What could he do then? Every moment was of vital importance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey had been great friends once, five years before—almost inseparable,\r\nindeed. Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society\r\nnow, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never did.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was an extremely clever young man, though he had no real appreciation of the\r\nvisible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he\r\nhad gained entirely from Dorian. His dominant intellectual passion was for\r\nscience. At Cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the\r\nlaboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his\r\nyear. Indeed, he was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a\r\nlaboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long, greatly\r\nto the annoyance of his mother, who had set her heart on his standing for\r\nParliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up\r\nprescriptions. He was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both\r\nthe violin and the piano better than most amateurs. In fact, it was music that\r\nhad first brought him and Dorian Gray together—music and that indefinable\r\nattraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he\r\nwished—and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it. They\r\nhad met at Lady Berkshire’s the night that Rubinstein played there, and\r\nafter that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music\r\nwas going on. For eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always\r\neither at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him, as to many others, Dorian\r\nGray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.\r\nWhether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew. But\r\nsuddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that\r\nCampbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was\r\npresent. He had changed, too—was strangely melancholy at times, appeared\r\nalmost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his\r\nexcuse, when he was called upon, that he was so absorbed in science that he had\r\nno time left in which to practise. And this was certainly true. Every day he\r\nseemed to become more interested in biology, and his name appeared once or\r\ntwice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious\r\nexperiments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for. Every second he kept glancing at\r\nthe clock. As the minutes went by he became horribly agitated. At last he got\r\nup and began to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged\r\nthing. He took long stealthy strides. His hands were curiously cold.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe suspense became unbearable. Time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of\r\nlead, while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of\r\nsome black cleft of precipice. He knew what was waiting for him there; saw it,\r\nindeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he\r\nwould have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into\r\ntheir cave. It was useless. The brain had its own food on which it battened,\r\nand the imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a\r\nliving thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned\r\nthrough moving masks. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him. Yes: that blind,\r\nslow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead,\r\nraced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and\r\nshowed it to him. He stared at it. Its very horror made him stone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last the door opened and his servant entered. He turned glazed eyes upon\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Campbell, sir,” said the man.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA sigh of relief broke from his parched lips, and the colour came back to his\r\ncheeks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ask him to come in at once, Francis.” He felt that he was himself\r\nagain. His mood of cowardice had passed away.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe man bowed and retired. In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in, looking\r\nvery stern and rather pale, his pallor being intensified by his coal-black hair\r\nand dark eyebrows.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray. But you said it\r\nwas a matter of life and death.” His voice was hard and cold. He spoke\r\nwith slow deliberation. There was a look of contempt in the steady searching\r\ngaze that he turned on Dorian. He kept his hands in the pockets of his\r\nAstrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had\r\nbeen greeted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one\r\nperson. Sit down.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCampbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him. The two\r\nmen’s eyes met. In Dorian’s there was infinite pity. He knew that\r\nwhat he was going to do was dreadful.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a strained moment of silence, he leaned across and said, very quietly,\r\nbut watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for,\r\n“Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody\r\nbut myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table. He has been dead ten\r\nhours now. Don’t stir, and don’t look at me like that. Who the man\r\nis, why he died, how he died, are matters that do not concern you. What you\r\nhave to do is this—”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Stop, Gray. I don’t want to know anything further. Whether what\r\nyou have told me is true or not true doesn’t concern me. I entirely\r\ndecline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself.\r\nThey don’t interest me any more.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest\r\nyou. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan. But I can’t help myself. You are\r\nthe one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter. I\r\nhave no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about chemistry and things\r\nof that kind. You have made experiments. What you have got to do is to destroy\r\nthe thing that is upstairs—to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will\r\nbe left. Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed, at the present\r\nmoment he is supposed to be in Paris. He will not be missed for months. When he\r\nis missed, there must be no trace of him found here. You, Alan, you must change\r\nhim, and everything that belongs to him, into a handful of ashes that I may\r\nscatter in the air.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are mad, Dorian.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are mad, I tell you—mad to imagine that I would raise a finger\r\nto help you, mad to make this monstrous confession. I will have nothing to do\r\nwith this matter, whatever it is. Do you think I am going to peril my\r\nreputation for you? What is it to me what devil’s work you are up\r\nto?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was suicide, Alan.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am glad of that. But who drove him to it? You, I should fancy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you still refuse to do this for me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course I refuse. I will have absolutely nothing to do with it. I\r\ndon’t care what shame comes on you. You deserve it all. I should not be\r\nsorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of all men\r\nin the world, to mix myself up in this horror? I should have thought you knew\r\nmore about people’s characters. Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can’t\r\nhave taught you much about psychology, whatever else he has taught you. Nothing\r\nwill induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man. Go\r\nto some of your friends. Don’t come to me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alan, it was murder. I killed him. You don’t know what he had made\r\nme suffer. Whatever my life is, he had more to do with the making or the\r\nmarring of it than poor Harry has had. He may not have intended it, the result\r\nwas the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to? I shall not\r\ninform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in the\r\nmatter, you are certain to be arrested. Nobody ever commits a crime without\r\ndoing something stupid. But I will have nothing to do with it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You must have something to do with it. Wait, wait a moment; listen to\r\nme. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific\r\nexperiment. You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do\r\nthere don’t affect you. If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid\r\nlaboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped\r\nout in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him as an\r\nadmirable subject. You would not turn a hair. You would not believe that you\r\nwere doing anything wrong. On the contrary, you would probably feel that you\r\nwere benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the\r\nworld, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind. What I\r\nwant you to do is merely what you have often done before. Indeed, to destroy a\r\nbody must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And,\r\nremember, it is the only piece of evidence against me. If it is discovered, I\r\nam lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have no desire to help you. You forget that. I am simply indifferent\r\nto the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Alan, I entreat you. Think of the position I am in. Just before you came\r\nI almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some day. No!\r\ndon’t think of that. Look at the matter purely from the scientific point\r\nof view. You don’t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment\r\ncome from. Don’t inquire now. I have told you too much as it is. But I\r\nbeg of you to do this. We were friends once, Alan.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t speak about those days, Dorian—they are dead.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away. He is\r\nsitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms. Alan! Alan! If you\r\ndon’t come to my assistance, I am ruined. Why, they will hang me, Alan!\r\nDon’t you understand? They will hang me for what I have done.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do\r\nanything in the matter. It is insane of you to ask me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You refuse?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I entreat you, Alan.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is useless.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe same look of pity came into Dorian Gray’s eyes. Then he stretched out\r\nhis hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He read it over\r\ntwice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table. Having done this,\r\nhe got up and went over to the window.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCampbell looked at him in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it.\r\nAs he read it, his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair. A\r\nhorrible sense of sickness came over him. He felt as if his heart was beating\r\nitself to death in some empty hollow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and came\r\nand stood behind him, putting his hand upon his shoulder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am so sorry for you, Alan,” he murmured, “but you leave me\r\nno alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the\r\naddress. If you don’t help me, I must send it. If you don’t help\r\nme, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to help\r\nme. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you. You will do\r\nme the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me\r\nas no man has ever dared to treat me—no living man, at any rate. I bore\r\nit all. Now it is for me to dictate terms.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCampbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The\r\nthing is quite simple. Come, don’t work yourself into this fever. The\r\nthing has to be done. Face it, and do it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA groan broke from Campbell’s lips and he shivered all over. The ticking\r\nof the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate\r\natoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne. He felt as if an\r\niron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead, as if the disgrace\r\nwith which he was threatened had already come upon him. The hand upon his\r\nshoulder weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush\r\nhim.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Come, Alan, you must decide at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I cannot do it,” he said, mechanically, as though words could\r\nalter things.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You must. You have no choice. Don’t delay.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe hesitated a moment. “Is there a fire in the room upstairs?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of\r\nnotepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things\r\nback to you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCampbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his\r\nassistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully. Then he rang the bell\r\nand gave it to his valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to\r\nbring the things with him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up from the\r\nchair, went over to the chimney-piece. He was shivering with a kind of ague.\r\nFor nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about\r\nthe room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian Gray, saw\r\nthat his eyes were filled with tears. There was something in the purity and\r\nrefinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him. “You are infamous,\r\nabsolutely infamous!” he muttered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,” said Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from\r\ncorruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime. In doing what I\r\nam going to do—what you force me to do—it is not of your life that\r\nI am thinking.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, Alan,” murmured Dorian with a sigh, “I wish you had a\r\nthousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.” He turned away\r\nas he spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered,\r\ncarrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and\r\nplatinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Shall I leave the things here, sir?” he asked Campbell.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” said Dorian. “And I am afraid, Francis, that I have\r\nanother errand for you. What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies\r\nSelby with orchids?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harden, sir.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes—Harden. You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden\r\npersonally, and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to\r\nhave as few white ones as possible. In fact, I don’t want any white ones.\r\nIt is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty\r\nplace—otherwise I wouldn’t bother you about it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No trouble, sir. At what time shall I be back?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian looked at Campbell. “How long will your experiment take,\r\nAlan?” he said in a calm indifferent voice. The presence of a third\r\nperson in the room seemed to give him extraordinary courage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCampbell frowned and bit his lip. “It will take about five hours,”\r\nhe answered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven,\r\nFrancis. Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have the\r\nevening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Thank you, sir,” said the man, leaving the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!\r\nI’ll take it for you. You bring the other things.” He spoke rapidly\r\nand in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him. They left the\r\nroom together.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the\r\nlock. Then he stopped, and a troubled look came into his eyes. He shuddered.\r\n“I don’t think I can go in, Alan,” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is nothing to me. I don’t require you,” said Campbell\r\ncoldly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian half opened the door. As he did so, he saw the face of his portrait\r\nleering in the sunlight. On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was\r\nlying. He remembered that the night before he had forgotten, for the first time\r\nin his life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he\r\ndrew back with a shudder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the\r\nhands, as though the canvas had sweated blood? How horrible it was!—more\r\nhorrible, it seemed to him for the moment, than the silent thing that he knew\r\nwas stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on\r\nthe spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred, but was still there, as\r\nhe had left it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with half-closed\r\neyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that he would not look\r\neven once upon the dead man. Then, stooping down and taking up the\r\ngold-and-purple hanging, he flung it right over the picture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere he stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his eyes fixed themselves\r\non the intricacies of the pattern before him. He heard Campbell bringing in the\r\nheavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he had required for his\r\ndreadful work. He began to wonder if he and Basil Hallward had ever met, and,\r\nif so, what they had thought of each other.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Leave me now,” said a stern voice behind him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust\r\nback into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.\r\nAs he was going downstairs, he heard the key being turned in the lock.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He was pale,\r\nbut absolutely calm. “I have done what you asked me to do,” he\r\nmuttered. “And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,” said\r\nDorian simply.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as Campbell had left, he went upstairs. There was a horrible smell of\r\nnitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting at the table was\r\ngone.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap15\"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThat evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large\r\nbutton-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady\r\nNarborough’s drawing-room by bowing servants. His forehead was throbbing\r\nwith maddened nerves, and he felt wildly excited, but his manner as he bent\r\nover his hostess’s hand was as easy and graceful as ever. Perhaps one\r\nnever seems so much at one’s ease as when one has to play a part.\r\nCertainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he\r\nhad passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age. Those\r\nfinely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those\r\nsmiling lips have cried out on God and goodness. He himself could not help\r\nwondering at the calm of his demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the\r\nterrible pleasure of a double life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a\r\nvery clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of\r\nreally remarkable ugliness. She had proved an excellent wife to one of our most\r\ntedious ambassadors, and having buried her husband properly in a marble\r\nmausoleum, which she had herself designed, and married off her daughters to\r\nsome rich, rather elderly men, she devoted herself now to the pleasures of\r\nFrench fiction, French cookery, and French <i>esprit</i> when she could get it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian was one of her especial favourites, and she always told him that she was\r\nextremely glad she had not met him in early life. “I know, my dear, I\r\nshould have fallen madly in love with you,” she used to say, “and\r\nthrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake. It is most fortunate that\r\nyou were not thought of at the time. As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming,\r\nand the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had\r\neven a flirtation with anybody. However, that was all Narborough’s fault.\r\nHe was dreadfully short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a\r\nhusband who never sees anything.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer guests this evening were rather tedious. The fact was, as she explained to\r\nDorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her married daughters had come up\r\nquite suddenly to stay with her, and, to make matters worse, had actually\r\nbrought her husband with her. “I think it is most unkind of her, my\r\ndear,” she whispered. “Of course I go and stay with them every\r\nsummer after I come from Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh\r\nair sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up. You don’t know what an\r\nexistence they lead down there. It is pure unadulterated country life. They get\r\nup early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they\r\nhave so little to think about. There has not been a scandal in the\r\nneighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall\r\nasleep after dinner. You shan’t sit next either of them. You shall sit by\r\nme and amuse me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes: it was\r\ncertainly a tedious party. Two of the people he had never seen before, and the\r\nothers consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged mediocrities so\r\ncommon in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by\r\ntheir friends; Lady Ruxton, an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked\r\nnose, who was always trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly\r\nplain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything\r\nagainst her; Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and\r\nVenetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his hostess’s daughter, a dowdy\r\ndull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are\r\nnever remembered; and her husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who,\r\nlike so many of his class, was under the impression that inordinate joviality\r\ncan atone for an entire lack of ideas.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was rather sorry he had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the great\r\normolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauve-draped\r\nmantelshelf, exclaimed: “How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late! I sent\r\nround to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to\r\ndisappoint me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door opened\r\nand he heard his slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he\r\nceased to feel bored.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut at dinner he could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away untasted.\r\nLady Narborough kept scolding him for what she called “an insult to poor\r\nAdolphe, who invented the <i>menu</i> specially for you,” and now and\r\nthen Lord Henry looked across at him, wondering at his silence and abstracted\r\nmanner. From time to time the butler filled his glass with champagne. He drank\r\neagerly, and his thirst seemed to increase.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian,” said Lord Henry at last, as the <i>chaud-froid</i> was\r\nbeing handed round, “what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite\r\nout of sorts.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I believe he is in love,” cried Lady Narborough, “and that\r\nhe is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous. He is quite right. I\r\ncertainly should.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dear Lady Narborough,” murmured Dorian, smiling, “I have not\r\nbeen in love for a whole week—not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left\r\ntown.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How you men can fall in love with that woman!” exclaimed the old\r\nlady. “I really cannot understand it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady\r\nNarborough,” said Lord Henry. “She is the one link between us and\r\nyour short frocks.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry. But I remember\r\nher very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how <i>décolletée</i> she was\r\nthen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She is still <i>décolletée</i>,” he answered, taking an olive in\r\nhis long fingers; “and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an\r\n<i>édition de luxe</i> of a bad French novel. She is really wonderful, and full\r\nof surprises. Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her\r\nthird husband died, her hair turned quite gold from grief.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How can you, Harry!” cried Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is a most romantic explanation,” laughed the hostess.\r\n“But her third husband, Lord Henry! You don’t mean to say Ferrol is\r\nthe fourth?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly, Lady Narborough.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t believe a word of it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, ask Mr. Gray. He is one of her most intimate friends.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is it true, Mr. Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She assures me so, Lady Narborough,” said Dorian. “I asked\r\nher whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she had their hearts embalmed and hung\r\nat her girdle. She told me she didn’t, because none of them had had any\r\nhearts at all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Four husbands! Upon my word that is <i>trop de zêle</i>.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Trop d’audace</i>, I tell her,” said Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! she is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol\r\nlike? I don’t know him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal\r\nclasses,” said Lord Henry, sipping his wine.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLady Narborough hit him with her fan. “Lord Henry, I am not at all\r\nsurprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But what world says that?” asked Lord Henry, elevating his\r\neyebrows. “It can only be the next world. This world and I are on\r\nexcellent terms.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Everybody I know says you are very wicked,” cried the old lady,\r\nshaking her head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry looked serious for some moments. “It is perfectly\r\nmonstrous,” he said, at last, “the way people go about nowadays\r\nsaying things against one behind one’s back that are absolutely and\r\nentirely true.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Isn’t he incorrigible?” cried Dorian, leaning forward in his\r\nchair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope so,” said his hostess, laughing. “But really, if you\r\nall worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry\r\nagain so as to be in the fashion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,” broke in Lord Henry.\r\n“You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she\r\ndetested her first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he adored\r\nhis first wife. Women try their luck; men risk theirs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Narborough wasn’t perfect,” cried the old lady.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If he had been, you would not have loved him, my dear lady,” was\r\nthe rejoinder. “Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them,\r\nthey will forgive us everything, even our intellects. You will never ask me to\r\ndinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite\r\ntrue.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for your\r\ndefects, where would you all be? Not one of you would ever be married. You\r\nwould be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however, that that would alter\r\nyou much. Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors, and all the\r\nbachelors like married men.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Fin de siêcle</i>,” murmured Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“<i>Fin du globe</i>,” answered his hostess.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish it were <i>fin du globe</i>,” said Dorian with a sigh.\r\n“Life is a great disappointment.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah, my dear,” cried Lady Narborough, putting on her gloves,\r\n“don’t tell me that you have exhausted life. When a man says that\r\none knows that life has exhausted him. Lord Henry is very wicked, and I\r\nsometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good—you look so\r\ngood. I must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don’t you think that Mr.\r\nGray should get married?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am always telling him so, Lady Narborough,” said Lord Henry with\r\na bow.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him. I shall go through\r\nDebrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the eligible young\r\nladies.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“With their ages, Lady Narborough?” asked Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done in\r\na hurry. I want it to be what <i>The Morning Post</i> calls a suitable\r\nalliance, and I want you both to be happy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!” exclaimed Lord\r\nHenry. “A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love\r\nher.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! what a cynic you are!” cried the old lady, pushing back her\r\nchair and nodding to Lady Ruxton. “You must come and dine with me soon\r\nagain. You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew\r\nprescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet, though.\r\nI want it to be a delightful gathering.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I like men who have a future and women who have a past,” he\r\nanswered. “Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I fear so,” she said, laughing, as she stood up. “A thousand\r\npardons, my dear Lady Ruxton,” she added, “I didn’t see you\r\nhadn’t finished your cigarette.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never mind, Lady Narborough. I smoke a great deal too much. I am going\r\nto limit myself, for the future.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pray don’t, Lady Ruxton,” said Lord Henry. “Moderation\r\nis a fatal thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a\r\nfeast.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLady Ruxton glanced at him curiously. “You must come and explain that to\r\nme some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,” she\r\nmurmured, as she swept out of the room.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Now, mind you don’t stay too long over your politics and\r\nscandal,” cried Lady Narborough from the door. “If you do, we are\r\nsure to squabble upstairs.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and\r\ncame up to the top. Dorian Gray changed his seat and went and sat by Lord\r\nHenry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the\r\nHouse of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The word\r\n<i>doctrinaire</i>—word full of terror to the British\r\nmind—reappeared from time to time between his explosions. An alliterative\r\nprefix served as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the\r\npinnacles of thought. The inherited stupidity of the race—sound English\r\ncommon sense he jovially termed it—was shown to be the proper bulwark for\r\nsociety.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA smile curved Lord Henry’s lips, and he turned round and looked at\r\nDorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Are you better, my dear fellow?” he asked. “You seemed\r\nrather out of sorts at dinner.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am quite well, Harry. I am tired. That is all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to\r\nyou. She tells me she is going down to Selby.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“She has promised to come on the twentieth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is Monmouth to be there, too?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, yes, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he bores her. She is very\r\nclever, too clever for a woman. She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness. It\r\nis the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious. Her feet are very\r\npretty, but they are not feet of clay. White porcelain feet, if you like. They\r\nhave been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens. She has\r\nhad experiences.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How long has she been married?” asked Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“An eternity, she tells me. I believe, according to the peerage, it is\r\nten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time\r\nthrown in. Who else is coming?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his wife, our hostess, Geoffrey\r\nClouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I like him,” said Lord Henry. “A great many people\r\ndon’t, but I find him charming. He atones for being occasionally somewhat\r\noverdressed by being always absolutely over-educated. He is a very modern\r\ntype.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t know if he will be able to come, Harry. He may have to go\r\nto Monte Carlo with his father.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! what a nuisance people’s people are! Try and make him come. By\r\nthe way, Dorian, you ran off very early last night. You left before eleven.\r\nWhat did you do afterwards? Did you go straight home?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian glanced at him hurriedly and frowned.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, Harry,” he said at last, “I did not get home till nearly\r\nthree.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Did you go to the club?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” he answered. Then he bit his lip. “No, I don’t\r\nmean that. I didn’t go to the club. I walked about. I forget what I\r\ndid.... How inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has\r\nbeen doing. I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at\r\nhalf-past two, if you wish to know the exact time. I had left my latch-key at\r\nhome, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any corroborative evidence\r\non the subject, you can ask him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry shrugged his shoulders. “My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let us\r\ngo up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman. Something has\r\nhappened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not yourself\r\nto-night.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper. I shall\r\ncome round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady\r\nNarborough. I shan’t go upstairs. I shall go home. I must go home.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time. The\r\nduchess is coming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will try to be there, Harry,” he said, leaving the room. As he\r\ndrove back to his own house, he was conscious that the sense of terror he\r\nthought he had strangled had come back to him. Lord Henry’s casual\r\nquestioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment, and he wanted his nerve\r\nstill. Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He winced. He hated the\r\nidea of even touching them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYet it had to be done. He realized that, and when he had locked the door of his\r\nlibrary, he opened the secret press into which he had thrust Basil\r\nHallward’s coat and bag. A huge fire was blazing. He piled another log on\r\nit. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible. It took\r\nhim three-quarters of an hour to consume everything. At the end he felt faint\r\nand sick, and having lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier,\r\nhe bathed his hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly he started. His eyes grew strangely bright, and he gnawed nervously at\r\nhis underlip. Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made\r\nout of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis. He watched it as though it\r\nwere a thing that could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something\r\nthat he longed for and yet almost loathed. His breath quickened. A mad craving\r\ncame over him. He lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His eyelids drooped\r\ntill the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek. But he still watched the\r\ncabinet. At last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying, went over\r\nto it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring. A triangular drawer\r\npassed slowly out. His fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and\r\nclosed on something. It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer,\r\nelaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken\r\ncords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads. He\r\nopened it. Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy\r\nand persistent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his face.\r\nThen shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot, he drew\r\nhimself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes to twelve. He put\r\nthe box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he did so, and went into his\r\nbedroom.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed\r\ncommonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his throat, crept quietly out of his\r\nhouse. In Bond Street he found a hansom with a good horse. He hailed it and in\r\na low voice gave the driver an address.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe man shook his head. “It is too far for me,” he muttered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here is a sovereign for you,” said Dorian. “You shall have\r\nanother if you drive fast.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All right, sir,” answered the man, “you will be there in an\r\nhour,” and after his fare had got in he turned his horse round and drove\r\nrapidly towards the river.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap16\"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nA cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the\r\ndripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were\r\nclustering in broken groups round their doors. From some of the bars came the\r\nsound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray\r\nwatched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then\r\nhe repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first\r\nday they had met, “To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the\r\nsenses by means of the soul.” Yes, that was the secret. He had often\r\ntried it, and would try it again now. There were opium dens where one could buy\r\noblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the\r\nmadness of sins that were new.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a huge\r\nmisshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The gas-lamps grew\r\nfewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the man lost his way and\r\nhad to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up\r\nthe puddles. The sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel\r\nmist.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the\r\nsoul!” How the words rang in his ears! His soul, certainly, was sick to\r\ndeath. Was it true that the senses could cure it? Innocent blood had been\r\nspilled. What could atone for that? Ah! for that there was no atonement; but\r\nthough forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he was\r\ndetermined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush\r\nthe adder that had stung one. Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to\r\nhim as he had done? Who had made him a judge over others? He had said things\r\nthat were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him, at each step. He\r\nthrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger\r\nfor opium began to gnaw at him. His throat burned and his delicate hands\r\ntwitched nervously together. He struck at the horse madly with his stick. The\r\ndriver laughed and whipped up. He laughed in answer, and the man was silent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some\r\nsprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he\r\nfelt afraid.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and he could\r\nsee the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of\r\nfire. A dog barked as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering\r\nsea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke\r\ninto a gallop.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven\r\nstreets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were\r\nsilhouetted against some lamplit blind. He watched them curiously. They moved\r\nlike monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things. He hated them. A\r\ndull rage was in his heart. As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something\r\nat them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred\r\nyards. The driver beat at them with his whip.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with hideous\r\niteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words\r\nthat dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in them the full expression,\r\nas it were, of his mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that\r\nwithout such justification would still have dominated his temper. From cell to\r\ncell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most\r\nterrible of all man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling\r\nnerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made\r\nthings real, became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one\r\nreality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered\r\nlife, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense\r\nactuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy\r\nshadows of song. They were what he needed for forgetfulness. In three days he\r\nwould be free.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane. Over the low\r\nroofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships.\r\nWreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Somewhere about here, sir, ain’t it?” he asked huskily\r\nthrough the trap.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian started and peered round. “This will do,” he answered, and\r\nhaving got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him,\r\nhe walked quickly in the direction of the quay. Here and there a lantern\r\ngleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman. The light shook and splintered\r\nin the puddles. A red glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was\r\ncoaling. The slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he was\r\nbeing followed. In about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house\r\nthat was wedged in between two gaunt factories. In one of the top-windows stood\r\na lamp. He stopped and gave a peculiar knock.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked.\r\nThe door opened quietly, and he went in without saying a word to the squat\r\nmisshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed. At the end\r\nof the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty\r\nwind which had followed him in from the street. He dragged it aside and entered\r\na long low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate\r\ndancing-saloon. Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown\r\nmirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of\r\nribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light. The floor was covered\r\nwith ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with\r\ndark rings of spilled liquor. Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal\r\nstove, playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they\r\nchattered. In one corner, with his head buried in his arms, a sailor sprawled\r\nover a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side\r\nstood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his\r\ncoat with an expression of disgust. “He thinks he’s got red ants on\r\nhim,” laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her in\r\nterror and began to whimper.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened\r\nchamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium\r\nmet him. He heaved a deep breath, and his nostrils quivered with pleasure. When\r\nhe entered, a young man with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp\r\nlighting a long thin pipe, looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You here, Adrian?” muttered Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where else should I be?” he answered, listlessly. “None of\r\nthe chaps will speak to me now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I thought you had left England.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at\r\nlast. George doesn’t speak to me either.... I don’t care,” he\r\nadded with a sigh. “As long as one has this stuff, one doesn’t want\r\nfriends. I think I have had too many friends.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such\r\nfantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the gaping\r\nmouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him. He knew in what strange\r\nheavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret\r\nof some new joy. They were better off than he was. He was prisoned in thought.\r\nMemory, like a horrible malady, was eating his soul away. From time to time he\r\nseemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him. Yet he felt he could\r\nnot stay. The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him. He wanted to be where\r\nno one would know who he was. He wanted to escape from himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am going on to the other place,” he said after a pause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“On the wharf?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That mad-cat is sure to be there. They won’t have her in this\r\nplace now.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shrugged his shoulders. “I am sick of women who love one. Women\r\nwho hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Much the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I like it better. Come and have something to drink. I must have\r\nsomething.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I don’t want anything,” murmured the young man.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never mind.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAdrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. A half-caste,\r\nin a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust\r\na bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them. The women sidled up and\r\nbegan to chatter. Dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low\r\nvoice to Adrian Singleton.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the\r\nwomen. “We are very proud to-night,” she sneered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For God’s sake don’t talk to me,” cried Dorian,\r\nstamping his foot on the ground. “What do you want? Money? Here it is.\r\nDon’t ever talk to me again.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTwo red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman’s sodden eyes, then\r\nflickered out and left them dull and glazed. She tossed her head and raked the\r\ncoins off the counter with greedy fingers. Her companion watched her enviously.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It’s no use,” sighed Adrian Singleton. “I don’t\r\ncare to go back. What does it matter? I am quite happy here.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You will write to me if you want anything, won’t you?” said\r\nDorian, after a pause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good night, then.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good night,” answered the young man, passing up the steps and\r\nwiping his parched mouth with a handkerchief.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face. As he drew the\r\ncurtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had\r\ntaken his money. “There goes the devil’s bargain!” she\r\nhiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Curse you!” he answered, “don’t call me that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe snapped her fingers. “Prince Charming is what you like to be called,\r\nain’t it?” she yelled after him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe drowsy sailor leaped to his feet as she spoke, and looked wildly round. The\r\nsound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his ear. He rushed out as if in\r\npursuit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His meeting with\r\nAdrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if the ruin of that\r\nyoung life was really to be laid at his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him\r\nwith such infamy of insult. He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew\r\nsad. Yet, after all, what did it matter to him? One’s days were too brief\r\nto take the burden of another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man\r\nlived his own life and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one\r\nhad to pay so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again,\r\nindeed. In her dealings with man, destiny never closed her accounts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what\r\nthe world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as\r\nevery cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses. Men and\r\nwomen at such moments lose the freedom of their will. They move to their\r\nterrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is\r\neither killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its\r\nfascination and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not\r\nof reminding us, are sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning\r\nstar of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCallous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for\r\nrebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his step as he went, but as he\r\ndarted aside into a dim archway, that had served him often as a short cut to\r\nthe ill-famed place where he was going, he felt himself suddenly seized from\r\nbehind, and before he had time to defend himself, he was thrust back against\r\nthe wall, with a brutal hand round his throat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening\r\nfingers away. In a second he heard the click of a revolver, and saw the gleam\r\nof a polished barrel, pointing straight at his head, and the dusky form of a\r\nshort, thick-set man facing him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do you want?” he gasped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Keep quiet,” said the man. “If you stir, I shoot you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are mad. What have I done to you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,” was the answer, “and\r\nSibyl Vane was my sister. She killed herself. I know it. Her death is at your\r\ndoor. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you. I had no\r\nclue, no trace. The two people who could have described you were dead. I knew\r\nnothing of you but the pet name she used to call you. I heard it to-night by\r\nchance. Make your peace with God, for to-night you are going to die.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray grew sick with fear. “I never knew her,” he stammered.\r\n“I never heard of her. You are mad.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are\r\ngoing to die.” There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know what to\r\nsay or do. “Down on your knees!” growled the man. “I give you\r\none minute to make your peace—no more. I go on board to-night for India,\r\nand I must do my job first. One minute. That’s all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian’s arms fell to his side. Paralysed with terror, he did not know\r\nwhat to do. Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his brain. “Stop,”\r\nhe cried. “How long ago is it since your sister died? Quick, tell\r\nme!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Eighteen years,” said the man. “Why do you ask me? What do\r\nyears matter?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Eighteen years,” laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in\r\nhis voice. “Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my\r\nface!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJames Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant. Then he\r\nseized Dorian Gray and dragged him from the archway.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him the\r\nhideous error, as it seemed, into which he had fallen, for the face of the man\r\nhe had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of\r\nyouth. He seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if\r\nolder indeed at all, than his sister had been when they had parted so many\r\nyears ago. It was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe loosened his hold and reeled back. “My God! my God!” he cried,\r\n“and I would have murdered you!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray drew a long breath. “You have been on the brink of committing\r\na terrible crime, my man,” he said, looking at him sternly. “Let\r\nthis be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Forgive me, sir,” muttered James Vane. “I was deceived. A\r\nchance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into\r\ntrouble,” said Dorian, turning on his heel and going slowly down the\r\nstreet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJames Vane stood on the pavement in horror. He was trembling from head to foot.\r\nAfter a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping\r\nwall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps. He\r\nfelt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start. It was one of the\r\nwomen who had been drinking at the bar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why didn’t you kill him?” she hissed out, putting haggard\r\nface quite close to his. “I knew you were following him when you rushed\r\nout from Daly’s. You fool! You should have killed him. He has lots of\r\nmoney, and he’s as bad as bad.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“He is not the man I am looking for,” he answered, “and I\r\nwant no man’s money. I want a man’s life. The man whose life I want\r\nmust be nearly forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have\r\nnot got his blood upon my hands.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe woman gave a bitter laugh. “Little more than a boy!” she\r\nsneered. “Why, man, it’s nigh on eighteen years since Prince\r\nCharming made me what I am.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You lie!” cried James Vane.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe raised her hand up to heaven. “Before God I am telling the\r\ntruth,” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Before God?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Strike me dumb if it ain’t so. He is the worst one that comes\r\nhere. They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face. It’s\r\nnigh on eighteen years since I met him. He hasn’t changed much since\r\nthen. I have, though,” she added, with a sickly leer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You swear this?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I swear it,” came in hoarse echo from her flat mouth. “But\r\ndon’t give me away to him,” she whined; “I am afraid of him.\r\nLet me have some money for my night’s lodging.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe broke from her with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street, but\r\nDorian Gray had disappeared. When he looked back, the woman had vanished also.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap17\"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nA week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby Royal,\r\ntalking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her husband, a\r\njaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his guests. It was tea-time, and the\r\nmellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the\r\ndelicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was\r\npresiding. Her white hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her full\r\nred lips were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her. Lord Henry\r\nwas lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them. On a\r\npeach-coloured divan sat Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the\r\nduke’s description of the last Brazilian beetle that he had added to his\r\ncollection. Three young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes\r\nto some of the women. The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there\r\nwere more expected to arrive on the next day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What are you two talking about?” said Lord Henry, strolling over\r\nto the table and putting his cup down. “I hope Dorian has told you about\r\nmy plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But I don’t want to be rechristened, Harry,” rejoined the\r\nduchess, looking up at him with her wonderful eyes. “I am quite satisfied\r\nwith my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are\r\nboth perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers. Yesterday I cut an orchid, for\r\nmy button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven\r\ndeadly sins. In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was\r\ncalled. He told me it was a fine specimen of <i>Robinsoniana</i>, or something\r\ndreadful of that kind. It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of\r\ngiving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with\r\nactions. My one quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism\r\nin literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to\r\nuse one. It is the only thing he is fit for.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Then what should we call you, Harry?” she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“His name is Prince Paradox,” said Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I recognize him in a flash,” exclaimed the duchess.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I won’t hear of it,” laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a\r\nchair. “From a label there is no escape! I refuse the title.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Royalties may not abdicate,” fell as a warning from pretty lips.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You wish me to defend my throne, then?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I give the truths of to-morrow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I prefer the mistakes of to-day,” she answered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You disarm me, Gladys,” he cried, catching the wilfulness of her\r\nmood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I never tilt against beauty,” he said, with a wave of his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That is your error, Harry, believe me. You value beauty far too\r\nmuch.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be\r\nbeautiful than to be good. But on the other hand, no one is more ready than I\r\nam to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?” cried the\r\nduchess. “What becomes of your simile about the orchid?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good\r\nTory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues\r\nhave made our England what she is.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You don’t like your country, then?” she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I live in it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That you may censure it the better.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it?” he inquired.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do they say of us?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Is that yours, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I give it to you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I could not use it. It is too true.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You need not be afraid. Our countrymen never recognize a\r\ndescription.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They are practical.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They are more cunning than practical. When they make up their ledger,\r\nthey balance stupidity by wealth, and vice by hypocrisy.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Still, we have done great things.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Great things have been thrust on us, Gladys.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We have carried their burden.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Only as far as the Stock Exchange.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe shook her head. “I believe in the race,” she cried.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It represents the survival of the pushing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It has development.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Decay fascinates me more.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What of art?” she asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is a malady.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Love?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“An illusion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Religion?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The fashionable substitute for belief.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are a sceptic.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Never! Scepticism is the beginning of faith.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What are you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“To define is to limit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Give me a clue.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Threads snap. You would lose your way in the labyrinth.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You bewilder me. Let us talk of some one else.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Our host is a delightful topic. Years ago he was christened Prince\r\nCharming.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! don’t remind me of that,” cried Dorian Gray.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Our host is rather horrid this evening,” answered the duchess,\r\ncolouring. “I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely\r\nscientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern\r\nbutterfly.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Well, I hope he won’t stick pins into you, Duchess,” laughed\r\nDorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! my maid does that already, Mr. Gray, when she is annoyed with\r\nme.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And what does she get annoyed with you about, Duchess?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“For the most trivial things, Mr. Gray, I assure you. Usually because I\r\ncome in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half-past\r\neight.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How unreasonable of her! You should give her warning.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I daren’t, Mr. Gray. Why, she invents hats for me. You remember\r\nthe one I wore at Lady Hilstone’s garden-party? You don’t, but it\r\nis nice of you to pretend that you do. Well, she made it out of nothing. All\r\ngood hats are made out of nothing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Like all good reputations, Gladys,” interrupted Lord Henry.\r\n“Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one\r\nmust be a mediocrity.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not with women,” said the duchess, shaking her head; “and\r\nwomen rule the world. I assure you we can’t bear mediocrities. We women,\r\nas some one says, love with our ears, just as you men love with your eyes, if\r\nyou ever love at all.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It seems to me that we never do anything else,” murmured Dorian.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,” answered the duchess\r\nwith mock sadness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Gladys!” cried Lord Henry. “How can you say that?\r\nRomance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art.\r\nBesides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.\r\nDifference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely\r\nintensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the\r\nsecret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Even when one has been wounded by it, Harry?” asked the duchess\r\nafter a pause.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Especially when one has been wounded by it,” answered Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe duchess turned and looked at Dorian Gray with a curious expression in her\r\neyes. “What do you say to that, Mr. Gray?” she inquired.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian hesitated for a moment. Then he threw his head back and laughed.\r\n“I always agree with Harry, Duchess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Even when he is wrong?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry is never wrong, Duchess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And does his philosophy make you happy?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have never searched for happiness. Who wants happiness? I have\r\nsearched for pleasure.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And found it, Mr. Gray?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Often. Too often.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe duchess sighed. “I am searching for peace,” she said,\r\n“and if I don’t go and dress, I shall have none this\r\nevening.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Let me get you some orchids, Duchess,” cried Dorian, starting to\r\nhis feet and walking down the conservatory.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are flirting disgracefully with him,” said Lord Henry to his\r\ncousin. “You had better take care. He is very fascinating.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“If he were not, there would be no battle.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Greek meets Greek, then?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am on the side of the Trojans. They fought for a woman.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They were defeated.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There are worse things than capture,” she answered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You gallop with a loose rein.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Pace gives life,” was the <i>riposte</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I shall write it in my diary to-night.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That a burnt child loves the fire.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am not even singed. My wings are untouched.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You use them for everything, except flight.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Courage has passed from men to women. It is a new experience for\r\nus.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have a rival.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Who?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe laughed. “Lady Narborough,” he whispered. “She perfectly\r\nadores him.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You fill me with apprehension. The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us\r\nwho are romanticists.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Romanticists! You have all the methods of science.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Men have educated us.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“But not explained you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Describe us as a sex,” was her challenge.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Sphinxes without secrets.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe looked at him, smiling. “How long Mr. Gray is!” she said.\r\n“Let us go and help him. I have not yet told him the colour of my\r\nfrock.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! you must suit your frock to his flowers, Gladys.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“That would be a premature surrender.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Romantic art begins with its climax.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I must keep an opportunity for retreat.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In the Parthian manner?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They found safety in the desert. I could not do that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Women are not always allowed a choice,” he answered, but hardly\r\nhad he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a\r\nstifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall. Everybody started\r\nup. The duchess stood motionless in horror. And with fear in his eyes, Lord\r\nHenry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian Gray lying face\r\ndownwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of the\r\nsofas. After a short time, he came to himself and looked round with a dazed\r\nexpression.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What has happened?” he asked. “Oh! I remember. Am I safe\r\nhere, Harry?” He began to tremble.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear Dorian,” answered Lord Henry, “you merely fainted.\r\nThat was all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to\r\ndinner. I will take your place.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, I will come down,” he said, struggling to his feet. “I\r\nwould rather come down. I must not be alone.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe went to his room and dressed. There was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his\r\nmanner as he sat at table, but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him\r\nwhen he remembered that, pressed against the window of the conservatory, like a\r\nwhite handkerchief, he had seen the face of James Vane watching him.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap18\"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in\r\nhis own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet indifferent to life\r\nitself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down, had begun to\r\ndominate him. If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead\r\nleaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own\r\nwasted resolutions and wild regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the\r\nsailor’s face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed\r\nonce more to lay its hand upon his heart.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the\r\nnight and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual life was\r\nchaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination. It was the\r\nimagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin. It was the imagination\r\nthat made each crime bear its misshapen brood. In the common world of fact the\r\nwicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the\r\nstrong, failure thrust upon the weak. That was all. Besides, had any stranger\r\nbeen prowling round the house, he would have been seen by the servants or the\r\nkeepers. Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would\r\nhave reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane’s brother had\r\nnot come back to kill him. He had sailed away in his ship to founder in some\r\nwinter sea. From him, at any rate, he was safe. Why, the man did not know who\r\nhe was, could not know who he was. The mask of youth had saved him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think that\r\nconscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them visible form, and\r\nmake them move before one! What sort of life would his be if, day and night,\r\nshadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners, to mock him from\r\nsecret places, to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast, to wake him with\r\nicy fingers as he lay asleep! As the thought crept through his brain, he grew\r\npale with terror, and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder. Oh!\r\nin what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend! How ghastly the mere\r\nmemory of the scene! He saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back to him\r\nwith added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in\r\nscarlet, rose the image of his sin. When Lord Henry came in at six\r\no’clock, he found him crying as one whose heart will break.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was something\r\nin the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him\r\nback his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it was not merely the physical\r\nconditions of environment that had caused the change. His own nature had\r\nrevolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the\r\nperfection of its calm. With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is\r\nalways so. Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay\r\nthe man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The\r\nloves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides,\r\nhe had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken\r\nimagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a\r\nlittle of contempt.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter breakfast, he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then\r\ndrove across the park to join the shooting-party. The crisp frost lay like salt\r\nupon the grass. The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal. A thin film of ice\r\nbordered the flat, reed-grown lake.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt the corner of the pine-wood he caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston, the\r\nduchess’s brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun. He jumped\r\nfrom the cart, and having told the groom to take the mare home, made his way\r\ntowards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the open.\r\nI dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new ground.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian strolled along by his side. The keen aromatic air, the brown and red\r\nlights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out\r\nfrom time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated\r\nhim and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom. He was dominated by the\r\ncarelessness of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSuddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them,\r\nwith black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward, started\r\na hare. It bolted for a thicket of alders. Sir Geoffrey put his gun to his\r\nshoulder, but there was something in the animal’s grace of movement that\r\nstrangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he cried out at once, “Don’t\r\nshoot it, Geoffrey. Let it live.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What nonsense, Dorian!” laughed his companion, and as the hare\r\nbounded into the thicket, he fired. There were two cries heard, the cry of a\r\nhare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Good heavens! I have hit a beater!” exclaimed Sir Geoffrey.\r\n“What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns! Stop shooting\r\nthere!” he called out at the top of his voice. “A man is\r\nhurt.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe head-keeper came running up with a stick in his hand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where, sir? Where is he?” he shouted. At the same time, the firing\r\nceased along the line.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Here,” answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the\r\nthicket. “Why on earth don’t you keep your men back? Spoiled my\r\nshooting for the day.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe\r\nswinging branches aside. In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after\r\nthem into the sunlight. He turned away in horror. It seemed to him that\r\nmisfortune followed wherever he went. He heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was\r\nreally dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him\r\nto have become suddenly alive with faces. There was the trampling of myriad\r\nfeet and the low buzz of voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating\r\nthrough the boughs overhead.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a few moments—that were to him, in his perturbed state, like\r\nendless hours of pain—he felt a hand laid on his shoulder. He started and\r\nlooked round.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Dorian,” said Lord Henry, “I had better tell them that the\r\nshooting is stopped for to-day. It would not look well to go on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,” he answered bitterly.\r\n“The whole thing is hideous and cruel. Is the man ...?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe could not finish the sentence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am afraid so,” rejoined Lord Henry. “He got the whole\r\ncharge of shot in his chest. He must have died almost instantaneously. Come;\r\nlet us go home.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards\r\nwithout speaking. Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh,\r\n“It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is?” asked Lord Henry. “Oh! this accident, I suppose.\r\nMy dear fellow, it can’t be helped. It was the man’s own fault. Why\r\ndid he get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather\r\nawkward for Geoffrey, of course. It does not do to pepper beaters. It makes\r\npeople think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he shoots very\r\nstraight. But there is no use talking about the matter.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian shook his head. “It is a bad omen, Harry. I feel as if something\r\nhorrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,” he\r\nadded, passing his hand over his eyes, with a gesture of pain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe elder man laughed. “The only horrible thing in the world is\r\n<i>ennui</i>, Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.\r\nBut we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering\r\nabout this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed.\r\nAs for omens, there is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us\r\nheralds. She is too wise or too cruel for that. Besides, what on earth could\r\nhappen to you, Dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want.\r\nThere is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don’t\r\nlaugh like that. I am telling you the truth. The wretched peasant who has just\r\ndied is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is the coming of\r\ndeath that terrifies me. Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air\r\naround me. Good heavens! don’t you see a man moving behind the trees\r\nthere, watching me, waiting for me?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was\r\npointing. “Yes,” he said, smiling, “I see the gardener\r\nwaiting for you. I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on\r\nthe table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow! You must come\r\nand see my doctor, when we get back to town.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching. The man\r\ntouched his hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner, and\r\nthen produced a letter, which he handed to his master. “Her Grace told me\r\nto wait for an answer,” he murmured.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian put the letter into his pocket. “Tell her Grace that I am coming\r\nin,” he said, coldly. The man turned round and went rapidly in the\r\ndirection of the house.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How fond women are of doing dangerous things!” laughed Lord Henry.\r\n“It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will\r\nflirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present\r\ninstance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I don’t\r\nlove her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And the duchess loves you very much, but she likes you less, so you are\r\nexcellently matched.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for\r\nscandal.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,” said Lord\r\nHenry, lighting a cigarette.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The world goes to the altar of its own accord,” was the answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish I could love,” cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos\r\nin his voice. “But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the\r\ndesire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has become a\r\nburden to me. I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was silly of me to\r\ncome down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht\r\ngot ready. On a yacht one is safe.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what it\r\nis? You know I would help you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t tell you, Harry,” he answered sadly. “And I\r\ndare say it is only a fancy of mine. This unfortunate accident has upset me. I\r\nhave a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to\r\nme.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What nonsense!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope it is, but I can’t help feeling it. Ah! here is the\r\nduchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown. You see we have come back,\r\nDuchess.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,” she answered. “Poor\r\nGeoffrey is terribly upset. And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the\r\nhare. How curious!”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, it was very curious. I don’t know what made me say it. Some\r\nwhim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am sorry\r\nthey told you about the man. It is a hideous subject.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is an annoying subject,” broke in Lord Henry. “It has no\r\npsychological value at all. Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose, how\r\ninteresting he would be! I should like to know some one who had committed a\r\nreal murder.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“How horrid of you, Harry!” cried the duchess. “Isn’t\r\nit, Mr. Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He is going to faint.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. “It is nothing,\r\nDuchess,” he murmured; “my nerves are dreadfully out of order. That\r\nis all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn’t hear what\r\nHarry said. Was it very bad? You must tell me some other time. I think I must\r\ngo and lie down. You will excuse me, won’t you?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to\r\nthe terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and\r\nlooked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes. “Are you very much in\r\nlove with him?” he asked.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape. “I\r\nwish I knew,” she said at last.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe shook his head. “Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty that\r\ncharms one. A mist makes things wonderful.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“One may lose one’s way.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What is that?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Disillusion.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It was my <i>début</i> in life,” she sighed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It came to you crowned.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am tired of strawberry leaves.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“They become you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Only in public.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You would miss them,” said Lord Henry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I will not part with a petal.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Monmouth has ears.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Old age is dull of hearing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Has he never been jealous?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I wish he had been.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe glanced about as if in search of something. “What are you looking\r\nfor?” she inquired.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The button from your foil,” he answered. “You have dropped\r\nit.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe laughed. “I have still the mask.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It makes your eyes lovelier,” was his reply.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe laughed again. Her teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUpstairs, in his own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror in\r\nevery tingling fibre of his body. Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden\r\nfor him to bear. The dreadful death of the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket\r\nlike a wild animal, had seemed to him to pre-figure death for himself also. He\r\nhad nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical\r\njesting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt five o’clock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to\r\npack his things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham at the\r\ndoor by eight-thirty. He was determined not to sleep another night at Selby\r\nRoyal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in the sunlight. The\r\ngrass of the forest had been spotted with blood.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him that he was going up to town to\r\nconsult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence. As he\r\nwas putting it into the envelope, a knock came to the door, and his valet\r\ninformed him that the head-keeper wished to see him. He frowned and bit his\r\nlip. “Send him in,” he muttered, after some moments’\r\nhesitation.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs soon as the man entered, Dorian pulled his chequebook out of a drawer and\r\nspread it out before him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning,\r\nThornton?” he said, taking up a pen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, sir,” answered the gamekeeper.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was the poor fellow married? Had he any people dependent on him?”\r\nasked Dorian, looking bored. “If so, I should not like them to be left in\r\nwant, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“We don’t know who he is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of\r\ncoming to you about.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t know who he is?” said Dorian, listlessly. “What\r\ndo you mean? Wasn’t he one of your men?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“No, sir. Never saw him before. Seems like a sailor, sir.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe pen dropped from Dorian Gray’s hand, and he felt as if his heart had\r\nsuddenly stopped beating. “A sailor?” he cried out. “Did you\r\nsay a sailor?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, sir. He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both\r\narms, and that kind of thing.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Was there anything found on him?” said Dorian, leaning forward and\r\nlooking at the man with startled eyes. “Anything that would tell his\r\nname?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Some money, sir—not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of\r\nany kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we\r\nthink.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian started to his feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him. He clutched at\r\nit madly. “Where is the body?” he exclaimed. “Quick! I must\r\nsee it at once.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don’t\r\nlike to have that sort of thing in their houses. They say a corpse brings bad\r\nluck.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to\r\nbring my horse round. No. Never mind. I’ll go to the stables myself. It\r\nwill save time.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the long\r\navenue as hard as he could go. The trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral\r\nprocession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path. Once the mare\r\nswerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him. He lashed her across the\r\nneck with his crop. She cleft the dusky air like an arrow. The stones flew from\r\nher hoofs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last he reached the Home Farm. Two men were loitering in the yard. He leaped\r\nfrom the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the farthest stable a\r\nlight was glimmering. Something seemed to tell him that the body was there, and\r\nhe hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere he paused for a moment, feeling that he was on the brink of a discovery\r\nthat would either make or mar his life. Then he thrust the door open and\r\nentered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed\r\nin a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers. A spotted handkerchief had been\r\nplaced over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray shuddered. He felt that his could not be the hand to take the\r\nhandkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,” he said,\r\nclutching at the door-post for support.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the farm-servant had done so, he stepped forward. A cry of joy broke from\r\nhis lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he rode home, his\r\neyes were full of tears, for he knew he was safe.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap19\"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n“There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,”\r\ncried Lord Henry, dipping his white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with\r\nrose-water. “You are quite perfect. Pray, don’t change.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray shook his head. “No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful\r\nthings in my life. I am not going to do any more. I began my good actions\r\nyesterday.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Where were you yesterday?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“In the country, Harry. I was staying at a little inn by myself.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear boy,” said Lord Henry, smiling, “anybody can be good\r\nin the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people\r\nwho live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not by any\r\nmeans an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can\r\nreach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people\r\nhave no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Culture and corruption,” echoed Dorian. “I have known\r\nsomething of both. It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found\r\ntogether. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter. I think I have\r\naltered.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you\r\nhad done more than one?” asked his companion as he spilled into his plate\r\na little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and, through a perforated,\r\nshell-shaped spoon, snowed white sugar upon them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else. I\r\nspared somebody. It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She was quite\r\nbeautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was that which first\r\nattracted me to her. You remember Sibyl, don’t you? How long ago that\r\nseems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course. She was simply a\r\ngirl in a village. But I really loved her. I am quite sure that I loved her.\r\nAll during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and\r\nsee her two or three times a week. Yesterday she met me in a little orchard.\r\nThe apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair, and she was laughing. We\r\nwere to have gone away together this morning at dawn. Suddenly I determined to\r\nleave her as flowerlike as I had found her.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill\r\nof real pleasure, Dorian,” interrupted Lord Henry. “But I can\r\nfinish your idyll for you. You gave her good advice and broke her heart. That\r\nwas the beginning of your reformation.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Harry, you are horrible! You mustn’t say these dreadful things.\r\nHetty’s heart is not broken. Of course, she cried and all that. But there\r\nis no disgrace upon her. She can live, like Perdita, in her garden of mint and\r\nmarigold.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“And weep over a faithless Florizel,” said Lord Henry, laughing, as\r\nhe leaned back in his chair. “My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously\r\nboyish moods. Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any\r\none of her own rank? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter\r\nor a grinning ploughman. Well, the fact of having met you, and loved you, will\r\nteach her to despise her husband, and she will be wretched. From a moral point\r\nof view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation. Even as a\r\nbeginning, it is poor. Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn’t floating\r\nat the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round\r\nher, like Ophelia?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I can’t bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest\r\nthe most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now. I don’t care what\r\nyou say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! As I rode\r\npast the farm this morning, I saw her white face at the window, like a spray of\r\njasmine. Don’t let us talk about it any more, and don’t try to\r\npersuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little\r\nbit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin. I want to be\r\nbetter. I am going to be better. Tell me something about yourself. What is\r\ngoing on in town? I have not been to the club for days.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“The people are still discussing poor Basil’s disappearance.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time,”\r\nsaid Dorian, pouring himself out some wine and frowning slightly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the\r\nBritish public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than\r\none topic every three months. They have been very fortunate lately, however.\r\nThey have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell’s suicide. Now they\r\nhave got the mysterious disappearance of an artist. Scotland Yard still insists\r\nthat the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the\r\nninth of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil\r\nnever arrived in Paris at all. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told\r\nthat he has been seen in San Francisco. It is an odd thing, but every one who\r\ndisappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful city,\r\nand possess all the attractions of the next world.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What do you think has happened to Basil?” asked Dorian, holding up\r\nhis Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he could discuss\r\nthe matter so calmly.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is\r\nno business of mine. If he is dead, I don’t want to think about him.\r\nDeath is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why?” said the younger man wearily.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Because,” said Lord Henry, passing beneath his nostrils the gilt\r\ntrellis of an open vinaigrette box, “one can survive everything nowadays\r\nexcept that. Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth\r\ncentury that one cannot explain away. Let us have our coffee in the music-room,\r\nDorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played\r\nChopin exquisitely. Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her. The house is rather\r\nlonely without her. Of course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit. But\r\nthen one regrets the loss even of one’s worst habits. Perhaps one regrets\r\nthem the most. They are such an essential part of one’s\r\npersonality.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next room,\r\nsat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black\r\nivory of the keys. After the coffee had been brought in, he stopped, and\r\nlooking over at Lord Henry, said, “Harry, did it ever occur to you that\r\nBasil was murdered?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry yawned. “Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury\r\nwatch. Why should he have been murdered? He was not clever enough to have\r\nenemies. Of course, he had a wonderful genius for painting. But a man can paint\r\nlike Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible. Basil was really rather dull. He\r\nonly interested me once, and that was when he told me, years ago, that he had a\r\nwild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I was very fond of Basil,” said Dorian with a note of sadness in\r\nhis voice. “But don’t people say that he was murdered?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all probable.\r\nI know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to\r\nhave gone to them. He had no curiosity. It was his chief defect.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered\r\nBasil?” said the younger man. He watched him intently after he had\r\nspoken.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that\r\ndoesn’t suit you. All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime. It\r\nis not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by\r\nsaying so, but I assure you it is true. Crime belongs exclusively to the lower\r\norders. I don’t blame them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that\r\ncrime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary\r\nsensations.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who has\r\nonce committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again? Don’t\r\ntell me that.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,” cried\r\nLord Henry, laughing. “That is one of the most important secrets of life.\r\nI should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should never do\r\nanything that one cannot talk about after dinner. But let us pass from poor\r\nBasil. I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as\r\nyou suggest, but I can’t. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an\r\nomnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal. Yes: I should fancy that\r\nwas his end. I see him lying now on his back under those dull-green waters,\r\nwith the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair. Do\r\nyou know, I don’t think he would have done much more good work. During\r\nthe last ten years his painting had gone off very much.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began to\r\nstroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged bird with pink\r\ncrest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch. As his pointed\r\nfingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black,\r\nglasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes,” he continued, turning round and taking his handkerchief out\r\nof his pocket; “his painting had quite gone off. It seemed to me to have\r\nlost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he ceased to be great\r\nfriends, he ceased to be a great artist. What was it separated you? I suppose\r\nhe bored you. If so, he never forgave you. It’s a habit bores have. By\r\nthe way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you? I\r\ndon’t think I have ever seen it since he finished it. Oh! I remember your\r\ntelling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got\r\nmislaid or stolen on the way. You never got it back? What a pity! it was really\r\na masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it. I wish I had now. It belonged to\r\nBasil’s best period. Since then, his work was that curious mixture of bad\r\npainting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a\r\nrepresentative British artist. Did you advertise for it? You should.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I forget,” said Dorian. “I suppose I did. But I never really\r\nliked it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me.\r\nWhy do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some\r\nplay—Hamlet, I think—how do they run?—\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"poem\">\r\n“Like the painting of a sorrow,<br>\r\nA face without a heart.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">\r\nYes: that is what it was like.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLord Henry laughed. “If a man treats life artistically, his brain is his\r\nheart,” he answered, sinking into an arm-chair.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian Gray shook his head and struck some soft chords on the piano.\r\n“‘Like the painting of a sorrow,’” he repeated,\r\n“‘a face without a heart.’”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe elder man lay back and looked at him with half-closed eyes. “By the\r\nway, Dorian,” he said after a pause, “‘what does it profit a\r\nman if he gain the whole world and lose—how does the quotation\r\nrun?—his own soul’?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his friend. “Why\r\ndo you ask me that, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear fellow,” said Lord Henry, elevating his eyebrows in\r\nsurprise, “I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an\r\nanswer. That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the\r\nMarble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people listening to\r\nsome vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that\r\nquestion to his audience. It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very\r\nrich in curious effects of that kind. A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a\r\nmackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping\r\numbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical\r\nlips—it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion. I thought of\r\ntelling the prophet that art had a soul, but that man had not. I am afraid,\r\nhowever, he would not have understood me.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Don’t, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought,\r\nand sold, and bartered away. It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a\r\nsoul in each one of us. I know it.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Quite sure.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain\r\nabout are never true. That is the fatality of faith, and the lesson of romance.\r\nHow grave you are! Don’t be so serious. What have you or I to do with the\r\nsuperstitions of our age? No: we have given up our belief in the soul. Play me\r\nsomething. Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low\r\nvoice, how you have kept your youth. You must have some secret. I am only ten\r\nyears older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow. You are\r\nreally wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do\r\nto-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first. You were rather cheeky,\r\nvery shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in\r\nappearance. I wish you would tell me your secret. To get back my youth I would\r\ndo anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be\r\nrespectable. Youth! There is nothing like it. It’s absurd to talk of the\r\nignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any\r\nrespect are people much younger than myself. They seem in front of me. Life has\r\nrevealed to them her latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the\r\naged. I do it on principle. If you ask them their opinion on something that\r\nhappened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when\r\npeople wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing.\r\nHow lovely that thing you are playing is! I wonder, did Chopin write it at\r\nMajorca, with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing\r\nagainst the panes? It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that\r\nthere is one art left to us that is not imitative! Don’t stop. I want\r\nmusic to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am\r\nMarsyas listening to you. I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know\r\nnothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is\r\nyoung. I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you\r\nare! What an exquisite life you have had! You have drunk deeply of everything.\r\nYou have crushed the grapes against your palate. Nothing has been hidden from\r\nyou. And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music. It has not\r\nmarred you. You are still the same.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I am not the same, Harry.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yes, you are the same. I wonder what the rest of your life will be.\r\nDon’t spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.\r\nDon’t make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need not\r\nshake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don’t deceive\r\nyourself. Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of\r\nnerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and\r\npassion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong.\r\nBut a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume\r\nthat you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a\r\nforgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music\r\nthat you had ceased to play—I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like\r\nthese that our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own\r\nsenses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of <i>lilas\r\nblanc</i> passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of\r\nmy life over again. I wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The world\r\nhas cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you. It always will\r\nworship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is\r\nafraid it has found. I am so glad that you have never done anything, never\r\ncarved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of\r\nyourself! Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are\r\nyour sonnets.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair. “Yes,\r\nlife has been exquisite,” he murmured, “but I am not going to have\r\nthe same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant things to me. You\r\ndon’t know everything about me. I think that if you did, even you would\r\nturn from me. You laugh. Don’t laugh.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne\r\nover again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the dusky\r\nair. She is waiting for you to charm her, and if you play she will come closer\r\nto the earth. You won’t? Let us go to the club, then. It has been a\r\ncharming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is some one at\r\nWhite’s who wants immensely to know you—young Lord Poole,\r\nBournemouth’s eldest son. He has already copied your neckties, and has\r\nbegged me to introduce him to you. He is quite delightful and rather reminds me\r\nof you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“I hope not,” said Dorian with a sad look in his eyes. “But I\r\nam tired to-night, Harry. I shan’t go to the club. It is nearly eleven,\r\nand I want to go to bed early.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Do stay. You have never played so well as to-night. There was something\r\nin your touch that was wonderful. It had more expression than I had ever heard\r\nfrom it before.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“It is because I am going to be good,” he answered, smiling.\r\n“I am a little changed already.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“You cannot change to me, Dorian,” said Lord Henry. “You and\r\nI will always be friends.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Yet you poisoned me with a book once. I should not forgive that. Harry,\r\npromise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You will soon be\r\ngoing about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all\r\nthe sins of which you have grown tired. You are much too delightful to do that.\r\nBesides, it is no use. You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be.\r\nAs for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing as that. Art has no\r\ninfluence upon action. It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly\r\nsterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world\r\nits own shame. That is all. But we won’t discuss literature. Come round\r\nto-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take\r\nyou to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome. She is a charming woman, and wants\r\nto consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying. Mind you come.\r\nOr shall we lunch with our little duchess? She says she never sees you now.\r\nPerhaps you are tired of Gladys? I thought you would be. Her clever tongue gets\r\non one’s nerves. Well, in any case, be here at eleven.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Must I really come, Harry?”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don’t think there have\r\nbeen such lilacs since the year I met you.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Very well. I shall be here at eleven,” said Dorian. “Good\r\nnight, Harry.” As he reached the door, he hesitated for a moment, as if\r\nhe had something more to say. Then he sighed and went out.\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\r\n<h2><a id=\"chap20\"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a lovely night, so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not\r\neven put his silk scarf round his throat. As he strolled home, smoking his\r\ncigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him. He heard one of them\r\nwhisper to the other, “That is Dorian Gray.” He remembered how\r\npleased he used to be when he was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about.\r\nHe was tired of hearing his own name now. Half the charm of the little village\r\nwhere he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was. He had often\r\ntold the girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor, and she had\r\nbelieved him. He had told her once that he was wicked, and she had laughed at\r\nhim and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly. What a\r\nlaugh she had!—just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she had been in\r\nher cotton dresses and her large hats! She knew nothing, but she had everything\r\nthat he had lost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen he reached home, he found his servant waiting up for him. He sent him to\r\nbed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over\r\nsome of the things that Lord Henry had said to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWas it really true that one could never change? He felt a wild longing for the\r\nunstained purity of his boyhood—his rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had\r\nonce called it. He knew that he had tarnished himself, filled his mind with\r\ncorruption and given horror to his fancy; that he had been an evil influence to\r\nothers, and had experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives\r\nthat had crossed his own, it had been the fairest and the most full of promise\r\nthat he had brought to shame. But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope\r\nfor him?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAh! in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the\r\nportrait should bear the burden of his days, and he keep the unsullied\r\nsplendour of eternal youth! All his failure had been due to that. Better for\r\nhim that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it.\r\nThere was purification in punishment. Not “Forgive us our sins” but\r\n“Smite us for our iniquities” should be the prayer of man to a most\r\njust God.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago\r\nnow, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as\r\nof old. He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror when he had first\r\nnoted the change in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked\r\ninto its polished shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him had written\r\nto him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: “The world is\r\nchanged because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite\r\nhistory.” The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over\r\nand over to himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on\r\nthe floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his beauty\r\nthat had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for\r\nthose two things, his life might have been free from stain. His beauty had been\r\nto him but a mask, his youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A green, an\r\nunripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its\r\nlivery? Youth had spoiled him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that. It was of\r\nhimself, and of his own future, that he had to think. James Vane was hidden in\r\na nameless grave in Selby churchyard. Alan Campbell had shot himself one night\r\nin his laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to\r\nknow. The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward’s disappearance\r\nwould soon pass away. It was already waning. He was perfectly safe there. Nor,\r\nindeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his mind. It\r\nwas the living death of his own soul that troubled him. Basil had painted the\r\nportrait that had marred his life. He could not forgive him that. It was the\r\nportrait that had done everything. Basil had said things to him that were\r\nunbearable, and that he had yet borne with patience. The murder had been simply\r\nthe madness of a moment. As for Alan Campbell, his suicide had been his own\r\nact. He had chosen to do it. It was nothing to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA new life! That was what he wanted. That was what he was waiting for. Surely\r\nhe had begun it already. He had spared one innocent thing, at any rate. He\r\nwould never again tempt innocence. He would be good.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs he thought of Hetty Merton, he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked\r\nroom had changed. Surely it was not still so horrible as it had been? Perhaps\r\nif his life became pure, he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion\r\nfrom the face. Perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away. He would go and\r\nlook.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the door, a\r\nsmile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered for a\r\nmoment about his lips. Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had\r\nhidden away would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been\r\nlifted from him already.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe went in quietly, locking the door behind him, as was his custom, and dragged\r\nthe purple hanging from the portrait. A cry of pain and indignation broke from\r\nhim. He could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning\r\nand in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite. The thing was still\r\nloathsome—more loathsome, if possible, than before—and the scarlet\r\ndew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.\r\nThen he trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good\r\ndeed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his\r\nmocking laugh? Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things\r\nfiner than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these? And why was the red stain\r\nlarger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over\r\nthe wrinkled fingers. There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing\r\nhad dripped—blood even on the hand that had not held the knife. Confess?\r\nDid it mean that he was to confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He\r\nlaughed. He felt that the idea was monstrous. Besides, even if he did confess,\r\nwho would believe him? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere.\r\nEverything belonging to him had been destroyed. He himself had burned what had\r\nbeen below-stairs. The world would simply say that he was mad. They would shut\r\nhim up if he persisted in his story.... Yet it was his duty to confess, to\r\nsuffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There was a God who called\r\nupon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven. Nothing that he\r\ncould do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin. His sin? He shrugged\r\nhis shoulders. The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him. He was\r\nthinking of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his soul\r\nthat he was looking at. Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing\r\nmore in his renunciation than that? There had been something more. At least he\r\nthought so. But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing more. Through\r\nvanity he had spared her. In hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For\r\ncuriosity’s sake he had tried the denial of self. He recognized that now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut this murder—was it to dog him all his life? Was he always to be\r\nburdened by his past? Was he really to confess? Never. There was only one bit\r\nof evidence left against him. The picture itself—that was evidence. He\r\nwould destroy it. Why had he kept it so long? Once it had given him pleasure to\r\nwatch it changing and growing old. Of late he had felt no such pleasure. It had\r\nkept him awake at night. When he had been away, he had been filled with terror\r\nlest other eyes should look upon it. It had brought melancholy across his\r\npassions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like\r\nconscience to him. Yes, it had been conscience. He would destroy it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward. He had\r\ncleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was bright, and\r\nglistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill the painter’s\r\nwork, and all that that meant. It would kill the past, and when that was dead,\r\nhe would be free. It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its\r\nhideous warnings, he would be at peace. He seized the thing, and stabbed the\r\npicture with it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its agony that\r\nthe frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms. Two gentlemen, who\r\nwere passing in the square below, stopped and looked up at the great house.\r\nThey walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back. The man rang the\r\nbell several times, but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the\r\ntop windows, the house was all dark. After a time, he went away and stood in an\r\nadjoining portico and watched.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Whose house is that, Constable?” asked the elder of the two\r\ngentlemen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n“Mr. Dorian Gray’s, sir,” answered the policeman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of them was\r\nSir Henry Ashton’s uncle.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nInside, in the servants’ part of the house, the half-clad domestics were\r\ntalking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying and wringing\r\nher hands. Francis was as pale as death.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter about a quarter of an hour, he got the coachman and one of the footmen\r\nand crept upstairs. They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out.\r\nEverything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got\r\non the roof and dropped down on to the balcony. The windows yielded\r\neasily—their bolts were old.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of\r\ntheir master as they had last seen him, in all the wonder of his exquisite\r\nyouth and beauty. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a\r\nknife in his heart. He was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was\r\nnot till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.\r\n</p>\r\n<p class=\"center\">\r\nTHE END\r\n</p>\r\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\r\n</p><div style=\"display:block; margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\r\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\r\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY ***</span>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\r\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.
